The corporation has already put one of its two Boeing 757s up for auction.  “The A320 we have planned to wet lease will be a temporary replacement for the Boeing,” said Rabindra Shrestha, spokesperson for NAC. “We expect that leasing the jet will not affect our schedule.” The lease contract will begin on July 16 and last for 45 days, and it can be extended to 60 days, NAC said.  The final deadline for the submission of proposals is May 8. The corporation plans to operate scheduled flights with the aircraft on the Kuala Lumpur, Doha, Delhi and Bangalore or other sectors.  NAC currently flies two A320 and one Boeing 757.

Most Popular SpaceX By Jay Bennett May 3, 2017 A purple Mylar party balloon pushes up against the lofted ceiling, a leftover remnant of some less technical and more carefree event that must have graced the Kennedy Caucus Room of the Russell Senate Building earlier this weekend, considering the structural integrity of the balloon. On the morning of Monday, May 1, however, the ornate chamber is the setting for a more sober affair. Leaders of space industry and policy have met to discuss how to make traveling to space more affordable—and our final frontier dreams of the future achievable. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Air Force generals, NASA reps, a member of President Trump's transition team, executives for private spaceflight companies (including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance), and former politicians have gathered here. The sentiment of the room is palpable: The culture of NASA needs to change. "The elephant in the room is SLS and Orion" Most Popular A Bloated Bureaucracy? If you came out of the Ultra Low-Cost Access to Space symposium (ULCATS) thinking one thing, it would be that NASA is swollen and inefficient. By the time the Space Launch System (SLS) flies in 2019—hopefully—building the big new rocket will have taken 15 years and cost more than $20 billion since George W. Bush announced in 2004 that NASA would return to the moon, with billions spent on the Ares rockets that went nowhere. That's not counting the Orion spacecraft, which has sucked up about $14 billion itself. As former Chair of the House Science Committee Robert Walker pointed out, when it takes more than a decade to develop a technology, the technology is obsolete by the time it is finished. "The elephant in the room is SLS and Orion," said Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, cofounder of the space technology company Escape Dynamics and a continuing advisor to NASA. By contrast, it took SpaceX four years to develop the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft after it won funding through NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. Elon Musk's company completed its first ISS resupply mission two years after the Falcon 9's first flight, and it landed a Falcon 9 first stage two years after that, using $396 million in federal money and about $450 million in private capital during that time.

It is developing a larger orbital rocket as well, New Glenn, all without taking a dime of public money. ULA has received billions in military contracts since it was founded in 2006, but the Boeing-Lockheed alliance currently flies a suite of four successful rockets, including the Delta IV Heavy, which has the highest payload capacity of any launch vehicle currently operated: 63,470 pounds. And yet, the time to cancel SLS in favor of more efficient solutions has long since passed. Although space organizations such as the influential Planetary Society have previously called for the program to be canceled and many still see it as a boondoggle, SLS may now be too big to fail. At this point, there has been too much money invested and we are too close to reaping some benefit to just throw the launch vehicle away. Although the mammoth rocket will cost some $500 million per launch, it will be able to lift about three to four times the mass of the Delta IV Heavy, which itself costs $375 million per launch. Plus, the rocket is now part of President Trump's plans. His preliminary budget draft for 2018 suggests the SLS and Orion programs will continue to push his desired expansion in manned spaceflight.

Instead, they want the U.S. to create an environment in space exploration that fosters innovation and brings about the survival-of-the-fittest competition of private industry. Speaker after speaker argued that private ventures have demonstrated that they can succeed where NASA and the Air Force have failed—in developing reusable and low-cost launch vehicles and spacecraft that will drive down price, drive up launch volume, and increase access to space to such a degree that the average American could think realistically about what they might want to launch into orbit. Most Popular "NASA requires political support driven by jobs in Congress," said de Cayeux, pointing out that this dynamic removes an economic incentive to innovate within the space agency. "You could argue that it works directly against this goal." Colonizing Space So are we going to get off this rock, or are we not? Newt Gingrich has his answer. "If space becomes cheap, we will actually colonize the moon in your lifetime," said the former Speaker of the House during a speech at the ULCATS symposium. Gingrich has been an avid advocate for aggressive space exploration for decades, and along with Robert Walker, he encouraged NASA and the Air Force to start developing reusable launch vehicles and move away from disposables in the late 1980s. Gingrich went on to say that humans would continue on to Mars, even as far out as Saturn, "with vehicles that are really much closer to the Enterprise than what we have currently." Evoking a sci-fi spaceship that flies faster than light might seem silly, but Gingrich brings up a good point about spacecraft size. The crewed spacecraft we are building now—primarily NASA's Orion, SpaceX's Dragon, and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner—are limited to four to seven passengers because of a specific hindrance: These craft are designed to launch from Earth where there is a lot of gravity. If we could set up manufacturing capabilities in orbit and on the moon, we could construct a ship in space, one potentially large enough to carry dozens or even hundreds of people in the far future. It's not hard to see that the first step to such a reality is making launches cheaper. The Air Force officers believe that at some point it will be necessary to establish a Space Service—a completely new branch of the military.

The company talks about its "cislunar vision," referring to the space between Earth and the moon. In the coming decades, ULA envisions an outer space industry to mine the moon and nearby asteroids, produce rocket propellant from lunar water and store it in orbit, establish fiber optic networks in space, and develop 3D printing methods for space manufacturing. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Leslie Kovacs, ULA's director for executive affairs in Washington D.C., listed off the company's glowing estimates about the markets of tomorrow. We could achieve a $500 billion industry in space with a few dozen workers stationed in orbit in the next 5 to 15 years, Kovacs said. At first the "cislunar marketplace" would rely on disposable rockets, but as reusables become the norm, private industry in space would grow and propellant production would take off to provide fuel for additional missions. In 30 years, ULA projects a $2.7 trillion industry in space with 1,000 permanently stationed workers as people travel to and from the moon. Most Popular Now, many people at the conference pointed out that these figures are largely meaningless, particularly the far-flung future ones. Even so, the general consensus is that there are serious industrial and manufacturing opportunities in space, particularly in space mining and rocket fuel production. The primary barrier is the high cost of rocket launches. Jean Floyd is president and CEO of Stratolaunch, which is owned by Paul Allen and is working with Scaled Composites to develop aircraft that could carry rockets to high altitude where they would then launch. Floyd argued that once you make space an affordable market, uses for that market that no one ever considered will sprout up. As for two of the biggest players, SpaceX and Blue Origin, the former is very serious about "making humanity a multiplanitary species," said Tim Hughes, Senior Vice President of SpaceX, and the latter believes it has a real opportunity to develop reusable landers for the moon. Elon Musk has instructed his camp to begin work on a new massive launch vehicle to take people to Mars, and Jeff Bezos has given marching orders to convert the New Shepard rocket into a lunar variant.

The Military Aspect Air Force leaders in attendance, such as Lieutenant General David Deptula, Deputy Chief of Staff for USAF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, echoed the notion of working hand-in-hand with private industry, in part because partnerships could give the United States a leg up over its adversaries in developing sophisticated space infrastructure. Exactly how to do that is still a challenge, however. The military officers discussed multiple possibilities, including establishing a new program office that would oversee the relationship between the DoD and private space companies. But Joshua Hartman from the consulting firm Reconnaissance Strategic Advisors pointed out that this would not be a traditional program office, as it would face the challenge of balancing commercial and government security interests. The Air Force officers also believe that at some point, it will be necessary to establish a Space Service—a completely new branch of the military. A Delta IV Heavy launches a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, January 20, 2011. U.S. Air Force/Joe Davila Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Bob Martinage, former Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy, said that once America has significant assets in space, those assets will need to be defended. Newt Gingrich put it another way: "Frankly, you're going to have to have military space because the Chinese won't give you any choice." The space industry is imminent. World peace is not. Major General Roger Teague, Director of USAF Space Programs, pointed out that America's adversaries are perfectly aware of the potential military advantages of space infrastructure: including secure and ubiquitous communications networks; sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and possibly even "kinetic" operations, meaning the deployment of weapons from space. China and Russia are both starting to invest heavily in reusable launch technologies, though China in particular is advancing at a rapid pace. When asked whether another nation could surprise the United States and develop sophisticated space defense systems first, the military brass on hand had to at least acknowledge the possibility. The China National Space Agency's (CNSA) second orbiting space research laboratory, Tiangong-2, launched on September 15, 2016. The station is docked with a Shenzhou 11 spacecraft. China Space Report When it comes to the capabilities that the military is looking for in space, the focus is deterrence. "The art of war is not about winning a fight," said Lieutenant General Steven Kwast, Commander and President of the USAF's Air University. "If you're fighting, you've already failed deterrence." Deterrence could come in the form of satellite networks, likely small CubeSats, that would number in the hundreds or thousands to prevent enemies from knocking them all out. These networks could provide communications relays or data transfer platforms. ISR satellites were also a primary focus, and Martinage pointed out that in-orbit refueling would be invaluable to keeping these satellites on the move, out of harm's way. And yes, "kinetic" capabilities were discussed as well—always in the guarded euphemisms of military lingo. "Frankly," Newt Gingrich said, "you're going to have to have military space because the Chinese won't give you any choice." The Next Steps We need to get launch costs low enough for more people to launch payloads to space. But once we do, the snowball will start to roll, and the real savings will come from a massive increase in the number of launches. Whether military, commercial, or scientific, the more we launch, the cheaper it will be. Most Popular "We are sitting at the edge of one of the most brilliant opportunities in history," said Gingrich during his speech, "to break into the future that Robert Heinlein wrote about." When asked by an audience member what the next step is, Gingrich said President Trump or Vice President Pence would likely soon deliver a speech that identifies low-cost spaceflight and reusability as the future. After that, a National Space Council will be established by executive order for the first time since 1993, likely to be chaired by Mike Pence—a move that is "imminent," said Robert Walker, who served as an advisor on space policy during the presidential campaign. "The executive order has been written. It's all set to go," said Walker. "I can tell you firsthand that Vice President Pence is extremely excited about his ability to be the chair of that council, and I expect it to be a very active part of this administration." Concept of a space habitat orbiting the moon. Lockheed Martin There are also plenty of engineering challenges that need to be met here on Earth. Martinage argued that our existing spaceflight infrastructure will need to be upgraded, saying of ranges and launch facilities, "we don't have enough, and it's old." Richard Dunn, the first General Counsel of DARPA from 1987 to 2000, said that education would be crucial, not only to train a new workforce for space industries, but to inspire kids to study STEM subjects so they can drive the coming revolution in space technologies. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "I really think the next decade is going to be as exciting or more exciting than the Apollo program," said Gingrich. One of the lingering questions here was this: What should be the new role of NASA? James Reuter, the only NASA representative to speak, talked about the need to develop technologies for in-situ resource harvesting and manufacturing on other planets. "There is a large interest in places where you need to construct a habitat with indigenous materials." These are the types of projects and studies that speakers at the conference argued NASA should focus on, while handing the reigns of vehicle manufacturing over to the private sector. The Mars 2020 rover, for example, will carry an instrument called the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment, or MOXIE, that will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide—a critical technology to ultimately allow future astronauts to produce oxygen for life support systems and fuel production on the Red Planet. NASA, the conference attendees believe, should stick to research experiments focused on the far future, so that when the time comes the research is available to develop new technologies on a large scale. NASA Golden Spikes and Kitty Hawk The leaders planning a big space future know such grand plans sound crazy to some people. As justification for these programs, the conference attendees loved to point to two breakthroughs they see as analogues to the space revolution: the transcontinental railroad and the birth of aviation. The first transcontinental railroad was an early example of success in a public-private partnership, with funding from the U.S. government as well as private interests that had made their fortunes in the preceding industrial revolution. The train was also shrouded in uncertainty. When the two sides began building, many people questioned whether the railroad companies would be able to blast through the Rocky Mountains at all. Fixed-wing aircraft were a similar triumph over the doubters. Lt. Gen. Kwast alluded to an October 9 1903 article in the New York Times written after a reporter visited Samuel Pierpont Langley to see the progress of Langley's flying machines, a venture that had been funded by War Department grants from the Smithsonian totaling $70,000. The Times reporter wrote in the article "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly:" It might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years—provided, of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials. On that very day, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Orville Wright wrote in his diary: "We started assembly today."

Carney | Washington Examiner On April 12, 2017, former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney sat down in the West Wing with President Trump. Trump had, on the campaign trail, advocated abolishing the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that typically subsidizes $10 billion a year in Boeing exports. On April 13, Trump announced he would fill out Ex-Im's board of directors, thus reviving the agency's ability to subsidize Boeing's overseas customers. This was a replay from eight years earlier. Candidate Barack Obama had called Ex-Im "little more than a slush fund for corporate welfare." Obama soon picked McNerney and General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as his manufacturing czar and jobs czar, respectively. GE is arguably Ex-Im's No. 2 beneficiary. Obama quickly came around on the agency, and became Ex-Im's most important ally in Washington.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column Boeing got a record tax break from Washington state and cut jobs anyway. Now the state wants to strike back FILE - In this March 7, 2017 file photo the first of the large Boeing 737 MAX 9 models, Boeings newe Elaine Thompson / Associated Press A new Boeing commercial airplane rolls past its production plant in Renton, Wash. A new Boeing commercial airplane rolls past its production plant in Renton, Wash. (Elaine Thompson / Associated Press) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter A few years ago, Washington state awarded the Boeing Co. the largest corporate tax break any state had given any corporation — a massive $8.7-billion handout aimed at encouraging the aerospace industry generally, and Boeing specifically, “to maintain and grow its workforce within the state.” Unwisely, state legislators and Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee didn’t make that a hard and fast requirement of the handout. So they’ve had to stand by powerlessly as the company has cut 12,655 jobs, or more than 15% of its Washington workforce, since that heady signing ceremony in November 2013. Layoff notices have gone out to 429 more employees in just the last few weeks. Now the state is poised to strike back. Two bills in the state legislature would claw back part of the tax break or eliminate it completely if the company continues to pare jobs. When you’ve got a company so dominant it can have its way with the tax code, you have to build in safeguards. — Greg LeRoy, Good Jobs First “This is a poster child for the incentives we give away,” Democratic State Rep. Noel Frame, one of the bills’ sponsors, told me this week. Laying off workers despite billions in tax breaks, she said, “has been so blatant in its disrespect for the will and intent of why we give tax incentives, the outrage is bipartisan.” The outrage comes partially from Boeing’s habit of forcing its workers to shoulder the pain of management’s inability to compete more effectively with Airbus, its European chief rival in the airliner business. Last December, the company blamed that competition for a sharp slowdown in orders for its 777X airliner, a mainstay of Washington state production lines, which it said would mean a hit to the workforce. But the very same day, the company announced a 30% increase in its quarterly dividend and a new $14-billion share repurchase program. Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg crowed that those initiatives signified Boeing’s determination to “meet our commitment to provide competitive returns to our shareholders.” The Boeing vote and the death of the middle class Michael Hiltzik Anyone following last Friday's epochal vote in Washington state on a union contract at Boeing could tell from the workers' comments in various forums that the key issue wasn't whether the contract was good or bad, or even whether Boeing was a good or bad company to work for. The rank-and-file majority... Anyone following last Friday's epochal vote in Washington state on a union contract at Boeing could tell from the workers' comments in various forums that the key issue wasn't whether the contract was good or bad, or even whether Boeing was a good or bad company to work for. The rank-and-file majority... (Michael Hiltzik) Don’t expect Boeing to take the threat of cuts in its tax subsidies lying down. “Changing Washington’s aerospace tax incentives would prevent Boeing from being able to respond to future market challenges,” Bill McSherry, a company spokesman, told the Legislature this week. He cited “significant competitive pressure on every order” and said that job reductions have occurred only “when absolutely necessary.” “Boeing has kept its word to Washington,” McSherry said, but that may be true only because its commitment was so vague. Many of Washington’s lost jobs, according to the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, have gone to South Carolina, Oklahoma, Missouri or Alabama, states where the company faces more tolerant employment regulations or has agreed to more explicit employment mandates, or both. According to Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies, Missouri has offered Boeing $229 million in subsidies if the company maintains a workforce of 14,500 and creates 2,000 new jobs; if employment falls below 11,000, Boeing must repay the subsidy. South Carolina capped some of its $450 million in incentives to attract a 787 Dreamliner plant at $12,500 per new job and mandated other investment. There’s little mystery to why Boeing was able to extract a lavish no-strings-attached handout from Washington. The company is the state’s biggest corporate employer and the source of thousands of high-paying professional jobs. But its demands also have turned Washington into the national leader in Boeing handouts, with $12.3 billion in incentives bestowed on the company over the years by the reckoning of Good Jobs First. (South Carolina comes in second.) Donald Trump's market-moving tweets are a huge scandal waiting to happen Michael Hiltzik An undercurrent of amusement has been detectable in some of the news coverage of Donald Trump’s recent market-moving tweets, as though it serves big companies right to have a few billions stripped off their market values because the president-elect is holding them to account. But it’s no laughing... An undercurrent of amusement has been detectable in some of the news coverage of Donald Trump’s recent market-moving tweets, as though it serves big companies right to have a few billions stripped off their market values because the president-elect is holding them to account. But it’s no laughing... (Michael Hiltzik) Washington’s multibillion-dollar endowment to Boeing dates back to 2003, when the state awarded the company more than $3.2 billion in incentives through 2024. But the big handout came in 2013, when Inslee and the legislature extended the incentives through 2040, at an estimated value of $8.7 billion. But that only heightened the need for Washington to be smarter. “When you’ve got a company so dominant it can have its way with the tax code,” says Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, “you have to build in safeguards.” Even beyond the scale of the subsidy, Washington was especially indulgent toward Boeing. “We gave aerospace and Boeing the largest tax break in U.S. history,” says Bill Dugovich, a spokesman for the engineering union, “and we’re the only state that didn’t tie the break directly to jobs.” The measures under consideration at the Olympia statehouse aim to rectify that failure. A Democratic version sponsored by Frame would set a baseline for Boeing’s Washington employment at 70,000 jobs. If the workforce falls below that point, the company would lose half its tax break; if it falls below 67,500, it would lose the entire subsidy. A companion Republican bill would require average employment of 75,000 jobs through 2024. Fall below that, and the tax incentive will expire in 2024. Frame says she expects the final version to resemble a melding of both measures. The bills reflect rising awareness that Washington, like some other states, has been lining corporate pockets with crucial revenues and getting nothing in return. “As a state we are dealing with a financial crisis related to funding for public schools,” Frame says. “We’re in violation of the state constitution and in contempt of a court order.” The incentives mean “our taxpayer dollars are going to Boeing’s bottom line, not to create jobs.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Why is President Trump praising autocrats, despots and dictators?

Analysts said Spirit Aero's tone regarding the negotiations with Boeing were a deviation from its prior remarks, which had indicated that talks were progressing constructively. Shares of Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit Aero fell as much as 9 percent to $53.06. Boeing and European rival Airbus SE have been pressing suppliers to cut prices on aircraft parts, as they seek to stay competitive amid burgeoning demand from airlines for more capable planes at lower prices. Spirit Aero's talks with Boeing relate to prices for parts including sections of fuselages, aerodynamic components surrounding engines and wing framework for the planemaker's best-selling narrow-body 737 aircraft and the wide-body 787-9 and -10 Dreamliners. "There's still a gap between us really on the 737 side as well as the 787 side. We're working very hard to close those," Spirit Aero Chief Executive Thomas Gentile said on a post-earnings call with analysts. The company, which gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from Boeing, has since last year sold aircraft parts to the planemaker on an interim supply pact, after a previous 10-year agreement expired in 2015. "It's an overhang until this is settled. You don't know how much cash (Spirit Aero is) going to get, and whether they have to give money back to Boeing ... it clearly clouds the visibility somewhat," Cowen & Co analyst Cai Von Rumohr said. Last year, Spirit Aero signed a fresh supply deal with Airbus SE for the wide-body A350 XWB aircraft, a competitor to Boeing's 787. However, Spirit Aero took a non-cash charge of $135.7 million related to that contract. Gentile said he was satisfied with the current interim pricing agreement with Boeing, but also added "it would be better to get to a final commercial settlement and remove some of the uncertainty that surrounded it." While Spirit Aero on Wednesday backed its financial forecasts for the year, some analysts also raised concerns about the company's growth prospects. "We see risk to future periods if negotiations break down or if Boeing is able to exert leverage over (Spirit Aero) as it has done with other suppliers," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Michael Ciarmoli said in a client note.

Post navigation ← GOPe: The Cuck Party No Wonder They’re Trying to Run Bannon Out of the White House → How the Swamp “Gets Drained” In the Real World Posted on May 3, 2017 by Bill QuickMay 3, 2017   Study documents how profitable access to Obama’s White House was On April 12, 2017, former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney sat down in the West Wing with President Trump. Trump had, on the campaign trail, advocated abolishing the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that typically subsidizes $10 billion a year in Boeing exports. On April 13, Trump announced he would fill out Ex-Im’s board of directors, thus reviving the agency’s ability to subsidize Boeing’s overseas customers. This was a replay from eight years earlier. Candidate Barack Obama had called Ex-Im “little more than a slush fund for corporate welfare.” Obama soon picked McNerney and General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt as his manufacturing czar and jobs czar, respectively. GE is arguably Ex-Im’s No. 2 beneficiary. Obama quickly came around on the agency, and became Ex-Im’s most important ally in Washington. Access to the White House is extremely valuable for corporations, regardless of who the president is. Everyone in Washington knows this, and now two scholars have confirmed and quantified the profitability to companies of access to the White House. How profitable, you ask? The first finding could be put this way: Access could be bought through campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures. “We find that firms that contributed more to Obama’s presidential election campaigns are more likely to have access to the White House. We also find that firms that spend more on lobbying, firms that receive more government contracts, larger firms, and firms with a greater market share are more likely to have access to influential federal officials.” Second, they found that access was profitable. “Corporate executives’ meetings with White House officials are followed by significant positive cumulative abnormal returns.” That term, “cumulative abnormal returns,” in this case basically means how much the stock in question outperformed the S&P 1500 index over the 10 days before and the 30 days after the meeting. “We also find that the result is driven mainly by meetings with the President and his top aides. We find insignificant CARs for canceled visits, suggesting that the actual incidence of the meetings matters for firm value.” The bottom line here is that access to any politician can be bought through campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures.  And any politician the donor class gives money to receives that money on the assumption, usually correct, that he will be able to give the donor more value than the donation in return.   Donors don’t give politicians a million bucks, hoping for a return of half a million in favors.  A million dollar donation would be expected to return at least a hundred million in added benefits to the donor, or it probably wouldn’t be worth making in the first place. Donald Trump made much campaign hay out of his status as a former donor who would not be accepting donations from the swamp people.  It looks as if he’s dealing away that promise as well.

By Stephen Carlson   |   May 3, 2017 at 1:51 PM Follow @upi Comments May 3 (UPI) -- Boeing has canceled plans to develop variants of the Harpoon anti-ship missile for the Littoral Combat Vessel and the frigate derivative from the U.S. Navy's program. "We've really taken a hard look at what the requirements are that Naval Sea System Command has looked for in the request, Troy Rutherford, director of Boeing Cruise Missile Systems, told UNSI News. "We've kept up to speed on every [request for proposal] modification and with that the constant change in the top-level requirements every time they do a modified release. We don't see that this solicitation isn't the right place for us to make entrée into the surface Navy because of how it undervalues our overall capability." The proposed upgrade from the current Harpoon Block II would have extended its range to 150 miles, along with providing a new, more powerful warhead. Rutherford told Defense News, however, that each version of the Navy's request for proposals included decreases or changes to top-level requirements for the missile. To meet the requirements, he said, the company "would have to take a lot of capability out of this existing system and really deliver a less-capable weapons system." The Harpoon missile and its variants has been in service with multiple countries since 1977. It is a surface, underwater and air-launched system designed to attack naval targets. The contract cancellation means that Lockheed Martin's Long Range Anti Ship Missile, or LRASM, and the Raytheon-Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile is the only real replacement options for the Harpoon. Boeing intends to continue developing upgrades for the weapon. "We see a market there for not only domestically but also for our international allies," Rutherford said. "We will double the current production program by the 2020s. With extended range we will double the current production program well into the 2030s."

Days before the landmark event, the Chinese state TV released a time-lapse video to show the building process of the highly anticipated aircraft. The narrow-body twin-engine C919 is set to rival the world's most popular airliners, Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, as China aims to spearhead the civil aviation market. A video released by CCTV News captured how workers built China's first homegrown airliner Workers transported the nose of the aircraft into the COMAC workshop in Shanghai  The mid-rear part of the first C919 plane was moved into the factory for workers to assemble RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next North Korean citizens swarm to see the outside world as...

Share this article Share The made-in-China airliner is built by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), a Chinese state-owned aviation manufacturer based in Shanghai. The single-aisle aircraft, which has taken 11 years to develop, can fit 158 to 175 seats.  HOW C919 COMPARES TO BOEING 737 AND AIRBUS 320 COMAC C919   Wingspan: 116ft (35.4m) Cruise speed: Mach 0.785 Maximum altitude: 39,700ft (12,100m) Passengers: 158-175   BOEING 737:   Wingspan: 117.5ft (35.8m) Cruise speed: Mach 0.74 Maximum altitude: 41,010ft (12,500m) Passengers: 85-215    AIRBUS 320: Wingspan: 117.5ft (35.8m) Cruise speed: Mach 0.84 Maximum altitude: 39,800ft (12,131m) Passengers: 100-240  In comparison, different models of Boeing 737 can seat 85 to 215 passengers; while an A320 can accommodate 100 to 240 people. The video was released by China Central Television on April 20 and captured the entire process of how the first C919 was put together. In the time-lapse clip, workers are seen spending 72 days assembling the aircraft at COMAC's factory in Shanghai after parts were sent in from four Chinese cities. China has spent 45 billion yuan (£5 billion) on the research and development of C919, according to estimation.  The aircraft has a flight range of up to 3,451 miles (5,555 kilometres), which means the aircraft can fly non-stop from Shanghai to Jakarta or from Paris to Montreal. Although the country has much ambition to challenge the world's current aviation giants, C919's maiden flight has been postponed for a number of times due to unspecified reasons.  The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) said on Wednesday the new date for C919's maiden flight would be May 5. The video shows workers spending 72 days assembling China's first homegrown airliner After the assembly, workers painted the livery on C919, which is set to take first flight on May 5 The plane is set to take off at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, subject to weather conditions, COMAC said in an online statement on May 3. C919 made its debut to the world in November 2015.   On the debut ceremony, COMAC's chairman, Jin Zhuanglong, said: 'The roll-out of the first C919 aircraft marks a significant milestone in the development of China's first indigenous aircraft.'  COMAC is yet to release the price tag of the jet, but a report by China National Radio predicted that C919 was likely to be priced at £32 million (US$50 million), which was up to 30 per cent cheaper than a Boeing 737 or an Airbus 320. This photo, taken on April 16, 2017, shows C919 being given the first high-speed taxi test at Shanghai Pudong International Airport C919, China's first self-developed airliner, is often compared to Boeing 737 (pictured) The Chinese aircraft is also set to rival Airbus 320, which is dubbed 'the work horse of the sky'. Above is a file picture of an A320 used by IndiGo Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) of the US and France's Safran. COMAC also plans a wide-body plane, the C929, in cooperation with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. Speculation is mounting that China will create a new aero-engine entity to try to produce the powerful jets needed for large civil aircraft. In a report released in October, 2016, The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects that 7.2 billion passengers would travel in 2035. The figure nearly doubles the number of air travelers in 2016, which is 3.8 billion. Previously, Airbus' Global Market Forecast predicted that the world would need around 32,600 new passenger and freighter aircrafts in the next 18 years to meet the growing demands.  China will become the leading country for passenger air traffic with its domestic traffic set to become the world' s number one within eight years, said the the same Airbus report. CHINA'S DREAM OF BUILDING ITS OWN PASSENGER PLANE  China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong's wife and a member of the notorious 'Gang of four', personally backed an attempt to do so. Y-10, a four-engine passenger jet, started developing in 1970.  But due to the project's high financial commitment, the development was halted by the central government in 1986. Only three Y-10s were ever made.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Boeing's Dreamliner Gets a Solid Win With a WestJet Order WestJet plans to order 10 Boeing 787-9s, with options for another 10. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 3, 2017 at 11:15AM Boeing (NYSE:BA) entered 2017 with a very cautious outlook for aircraft orders, but so far, it's running well ahead of last year's pace. As usual, the 737 family is driving the bulk of Boeing's order activity. However, the 787 Dreamliner family is also off to a solid start. On Tuesday morning, the Dreamliner bagged another important win as Canadian low-cost carrier WestJet (TSX:WJA) announced a firm order for 10 787-9s, along with another 10 options. Firm orders have been in short supply Boeing's Dreamliner program secured the bulk of its firm orders between 2004 and 2008, well before the type's entry into service. The launch of the larger 787-10 variant in 2013 spurred a brief uptick in sales activity, with 182 net orders for the 787 family that year. However, Dreamliner orders have trailed deliveries since then. From 2014 to 2016, Boeing averaged fewer than 60 net firm orders per year for the 787 family. By contrast, it's currently building 12 787s per month. Boeing hasn't received many firm Dreamliner orders in recent years. Image source: Boeing. Boeing's backlog of 672 firm orders for the 787 serves as a buffer for now. But unless order activity accelerates, it will eventually need to cut production. For Boeing to increase production to 14 per month as planned, it would need even more orders to come in. Through the first four months of 2017, Boeing has received just 13 firm orders for the 787 family. However, that figure excludes Boeing's two biggest Dreamliner deals of the year, as they have not been finalized yet. Two solid Dreamliner commitments The first of these order commitments came from Singapore Airlines in February. The Asian carrier, which had previously ordered 30 Dreamliner 787-10s, plans to buy another 19 787-10s, in order to modernize and expand its fleet. Singapore Airlines also has options to purchase six more 787-10s. This week, WestJet gave the Dreamliner its second biggest order commitment of the year, agreeing to buy 10 787-9s, with options for another 10. Deliveries of the first 10 planes are scheduled to run from 2019 to 2021. WestJet wants to expand its relatively new long-haul operations. Image source: WestJet. WestJet plans to use the 787-9s to expand its nascent international service. The company noted that the Dreamliner's long range would allow it to expand into Asia, Latin America, and deeper into Europe. Additionally, the 787-9s are eventually likely to replace the four Boeing 767s that WestJet is currently using for flights to London and Hawaii. Those planes are nearly 25 years old, on average, and probably need to be retired a few years down the road. Including the Singapore Airlines and WestJet order commitments, Boeing has captured 42 Dreamliner orders this year. That's a solid start to the year, considering that orders tend to concentrate around the top air show of the year -- the Paris Air Show takes place next month -- and near year-end. Is WestJet biting off more than it can chew? WestJet's ambitions seem to be growing rapidly. Just five years ago, it was strictly a low-cost carrier in the mold of Southwest Airlines, operating a uniform fleet of Boeing 737s. Since then, it has built up an extensive regional operation using turboprops and added Boeing 767s to its fleet to support longer-range flights to Hawaii and London. Just two weeks ago, WestJet announced plans to launch an ultra-low-cost carrier under a new brand name, using Boeing 737s with a denser seating configuration. Now, it also plans to expand its international service dramatically by adding 10 787-9s to its fleet. And in the meantime, WestJet, like other airlines, has to cope with higher fuel prices, which have already started to put pressure on its profitability. Thus, WestJet's management will have its hands full over the next few years. This raises the risk of execution mistakes for the proposed ultra-low cost carrier, for WestJet's growing international operations, or even for the company's core domestic business. That said, if WestJet is successful in moving into the international market, Boeing is likely to get plenty of additional Dreamliner orders in the coming years. Air Canada operates nearly 100 widebody aircraft, so it's clear that WestJet's potential market opportunity for the 787 is a lot bigger than 10 planes. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

By Stephen Carlson   |   May 3, 2017 at 10:35 AM Follow @upi Comments May 3 (UPI) -- Boeing announced on Tuesday it now has a total of six KC-46A tanker aircraft for its testing program, pending production and eventual deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. "Adding another tanker will help us to become even more efficient and significantly improve our ability to complete test points going forward," Jeanette Crop, Boeing KC-46A tanker test team director, said in a press release. "We are also re-configuring one of our 767-2C aircraft into a tanker, which means we soon will have four KC-46 tankers in testing." The newest of the planes, which is the second in the initial low-rate production, had its first flight on April 26. A significant part of the testing will ensure that the tanker can stand up to electromagnetic fields -- radars and powerful radio towers are capable of scrambling aircraft electronic systems if they are not carefully shielded. "This first flight is another important step for the KC-46 program toward verifying the aircraft's operational capabilities," said Col. John Newberry, Air Force KC-46 System program manager. "Adding this aircraft brings key capabilities to the test fleet and helps move us closer to delivering operational aircraft to the warfighter." So far the system has completed more than 1,600 hours of flight testing, as well as more than 1,200 refueling tests with a variety of Air Force planes, including the F-16, C-17, and A-10. Tankers play a vital role in long-range operations, refueling aircraft in midair in order to extend their range and keep them in the air longer. The KC-46 is a multirole tanker based off the civilian 767 airliner and is designed to carry passengers, cargo and patients. Boeing is expected to build 179 KC-46 tankers for acquisition by the U.S. Air Force. They will be built in Everett, Wash.

The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai on Friday, the company said on Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said, adding that engineers had completed some 118 tests. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it's going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China's aviation industry," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country's first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles). China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion. But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock on the market by Boeing and Airbus. "This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy," said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines. It had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it would take time but said that over the next century China would become a world aviation player. "You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC," he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC's first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. China also has been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for the C919, without result. The C919's first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric of the US and France's Safran. During a visit to COMAC in 2014, President Xi Jinping expressed concern that not having a homegrown plane left China at the mercy of foreign industrial groups. China last August launched a new multi-billion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919's first flight, it will need to pass tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can be sold.

Trump on new Air Force One: Cancel order! Source: BBC Date: 07-12-2016 Time: 01:12:37:am US President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to cut government costs by cancelling the order for new planes to carry the American president. Six weeks ahead of taking office, he tweeted: "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. They would enter service around 2024. Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest $50bn (£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. "Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!" he tweeted. In other developments: In his last major speech on national security, President Obama warned the US should not lose sight of it founding values while fighting terrorism Mr Trump sold his entire share portfolio in June, his spokesman says, in a move that could address conflict-of-interest concerns Congressional Republicans warned Mr Trump they would block his plan to impose punitive tariffs on US companies that relocate abroad A Republican elector in Texas vowed to withdraw his backing of Mr Trump when the electoral college meets next week Vice-President Joe Biden, 74, suggested he would be open to running for president for a third time, in 2020 'Could cost more' - Zoe Thomas, BBC New York business correspondent As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes. But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for $170m (£134m; €158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes. The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be $3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates. Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay. Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was "bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way". "Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?" he said at the time. The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was "doing a little bit of a number" and the cost was "ridiculous". "We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money," he added. Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. "If we do not lead when it comes to writing these (trade) rules, our competitors will write them for us," Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. The White House said it was not clear where Mr Trump got the $4bn figure he cited to replace the Air Force One plane. "Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense," said spokesman Josh Earnest. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be $3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. The US Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7bn for the project, "but expects this number to change". Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: "We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. "We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."

Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results; Meets Commitments; Reaffirms 2017 Guidance WICHITA, Kan., May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- First Quarter 2017 Results and Highlights Revenue of $1.7 billion on record deliveries Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.17 Cash from Operations of $112 million, up 19% y/y; Free cash flow* of $71 million, up 65% y/y Repurchased 1.4 million shares for $81.5 million Paid first-ever quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, or $12 million   Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. [NYSE: SPR] reported first quarter 2017 financial results driven by strong operating performance. Table 1.  Summary Financial Results (unaudited) 1st Quarter ($ in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 Change Revenue $1,694 $1,682 1% Operating Income $214 $267 (20%) Operating Income as a % of Revenue 12.6% 15.9%  (330) BPS Net Income $142 $172 (17%) Net Income as a % of Revenue 8.4% 10.2%  (180) BPS Earnings Per Share (Fully Diluted) $1.17 $1.29 (9%) Fully Diluted Weighted Avg Share Count 120.7 132.7 Total Change in Estimate $5 $47 ($42) EPS Impact of Change in Estimate** $0.03 $0.22 ($0.19) **Diluted per share based upon statutory rates "We are on track to ramp up the production rate on the Boeing 737 program from 42 airplanes per month to 47 per month before the end of the second quarter and increase the A350 production rate to 10 per month by 2018," Spirit President and CEO Tom Gentile said. Revenue Spirit's first quarter 2017 revenue was $1.7 billion, up by 1 percent compared to the same period of 2016, primarily driven by higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program. (Table 1) Spirit's backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2017 was approximately $46 billion, with work packages on all commercial platforms in the Boeing and Airbus backlog. Earnings Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $214 million, compared to $267 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to higher favorable changes in estimates recognized during the first quarter of 2016, which were $42 million higher when compared to those recognized in the current period. First quarter reported EPS was $1.17, compared to $1.29 EPS in the same period of 2016. The EPS impact from favorable changes in estimates was $0.19 per share more in the first quarter of 2016 than in the current period, based upon the statutory tax rate. (Table 1) Cash Adjusted free cash flow* in the first quarter of 2017 was $71 million, compared to $0 million (adjusted to remove the impact of the 787 interim pricing agreement) in the same quarter last year. (Table 2) Cash balance at the end of the quarter was $672 million. The company's $650 million revolving credit facility remained undrawn at the end of the quarter. "In the first quarter we executed on our current share repurchase authorization of up to $600 million by deploying $81.5 million toward the repurchase of 1.4 million shares. Also, after paying our first quarterly dividend of $12 million in January, our board of directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share," Gentile added. Table 2.  Cash Flow and Liquidity (unaudited) 1st Quarter ($ in millions) 2017 2016 Cash from Operations $112 $94 Purchases of Property, Plant & Equipment ($41) ($51) Free Cash Flow* $71 $43 Adjusted Free Cash Flow* $71 $0 March 30, December 31, Liquidity 2017 2016 Cash $672 $698 Total Debt $1,091 $1,087 "In addition, we started expanding our fabrication business and initiating work packages in order to leverage our internal capabilities, open capacity, and cost structure. In line with this new strategy, we made major investments in our McAlester, Oklahoma facility, and added three- and four-axis machines to establish a Machining Center-of-Excellence at that site," Gentile concluded. Financial Outlook and Risk to Future Financial Results Table 3.  Financial Outlook Unchanged May 3, 2017 2017 Guidance Revenue $6.8 - $6.9 billion Earnings Per Share (Fully Diluted) $4.60 - $4.85 Effective Tax Rate 31 - 32% Free Cash Flow* $450 - $500 million Risks to our financial guidance are described more fully in the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release. Segment Results Fuselage Systems Fuselage Systems segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 5 percent from the same period last year to $917 million, primarily due to higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB and increased defense-related activity, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to 16.4 percent, compared to 20.3 percent during the same period of 2016, primarily due to increased revenue from lower-margin programs and lower production deliveries on the Boeing 737 and 777 programs. In the first quarter of 2017, the company recorded pretax ($0.2) million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and net forward losses of ($5.9) million, primarily on the Airbus A350 XWB program. Propulsion Systems Propulsion Systems segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 decreased 7 percent from the same period last year to $406 million, primarily driven by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 18.1 percent compared to 22.6 percent during the same period of 2016. Year-over-year change was primarily driven by favorable changes in estimates recognized in the first quarter of 2016 and lower margins recognized on Boeing programs, mainly the 777. In the first quarter of 2017, the segment recorded pretax $1.5 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments on mature programs. Wing Systems Wing Systems segment revenue in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 2 percent from the same period last year to $369 million, primarily due to higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB, as well as higher revenue recognized on the Boeing 787 program which had comparable reductions in revenue within the propulsion segment. These increases to revenue were partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 747 and 777 programs as well as the impact from foreign currency fluctuations on the Airbus A320 program. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2017 decreased slightly to 15.9 percent, compared to 16.3 percent during the same period of 2016, primarily due to favorable changes in estimates recognized in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher margins recognized on Airbus A350 XWB wing-related activity. In the first quarter of 2017, the segment recorded pretax $8.0 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments primarily on the Airbus A350 XWB program and favorable changes in estimates on forward loss programs of $1.8 million.

The company does not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. Free cash flow is defined as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities (cash flow from operations), less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Management considers special items, which may include termination charges, settlement charges and other items that arise from time to time, to be outside the ordinary course of our operations. Management believes that excluding these items provides a better understanding of the underlying trends in the company's operating performance and allows more accurate comparisons of the company's operating results to historical performance. Accordingly, Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as free cash flow less these special items. The table below provides reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures.

China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus. Published: 13:48 May 3, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Shanghai: China is expected this week to conduct the maiden test flight of a home-grown passenger jet built to meet soaring domestic travel demand and challenge the dominance of Boeing and Airbus. The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai on Friday, the company said on Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. “If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled,” COMAC said, adding that engineers had completed some 118 tests. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. “The first flight itself is not a huge deal. [But] of course, it’s going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China’s aviation industry,” said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country’s first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of 5,555 kilometres. Long way to go China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion (Dh3.67 trillion). But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock on the market by Boeing and Airbus. “This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy,” said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines. It had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it would take time but said that over the next century China would become a world aviation player. “You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC,” he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC’s first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. Long-haul ambition The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. China also has been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for the C919, without result. The C919’s first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric of the US and France’s Safran. During a visit to COMAC in 2014, President Xi Jinping expressed concern that not having a home-grown plane left China at the mercy of foreign industrial groups. China last August launched a new multibillion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919’s first flight, it will need to pass tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can be sold.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 9 Brand-Name Companies That Provide at Least a 5% 401(k) Match These companies are near the head of the class when it comes to this lucrative employee benefit. Chuck Saletta (TMFBigFrog) May 3, 2017 at 6:00AM Image Source: Getty Images A strong 401(k) match is one of the most valuable employee benefits companies can offer. A good match can help employees more than double the value of the money they invest, better assuring their chances of long term financial security. A typical 401(k) match is 50% of contributions up to 6% of the employee's salary, which equates to an extra 3% of the worker's wages going toward retirement savings. Some companies, however, go well above average when it comes to helping employees save for retirement. The nine companies below will pitch in at least 5% of employees' salaries in the form of 401(k) contributions. The Arctic Sun LNG tanker. Image source: ConocoPhillips 1) This energy titan offers a titanic match Oil and natural gas giant ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) provides a match of 6% for all employees who contribute at least 1% to their 401(k) plans, plus an additional discretionary match of between 0% and 6% depending on factors like the company's performance. The company targets 3% for the discretionary match, putting the targeted match at 9% of an employee's salary. Given the cyclical nature of the energy business, the flexibility in the discretionary match helps the company be generous when times are good and cut back when times are tough without affecting employees' take-home pay. A 787 Dreamliner Airplane. Image source: Boeing. 2) This aerospace giant pays up to 6% Airline manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) offers employees up to 6% above and beyond their salary in the form of a 401(k) match. Boeing's match is 75% of up to 8% of an employee's salary contributed to the 401(k) plan. While that 401(k) match is a generous one, it's actually part of a replacement for an even more generous pension plan. In addition to the match, Boeing employees transitioning from the pension plan get a percentage of their salaries automatically contributed to their retirement plan, with the long-run target between 3% and 5% based on employee age. Image source: Getty Images. 3) This biotech business goes for double digits Biotechnology leader Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) offers employee an automatic 5% contribution into their retirement plans. In addition, the company will match employees' contributions dollar for dollar on up to 5% of their pay. As a leader in its industry, Amgen has several active products generating billions in revenue, enabling it to continue to invest in researching the next breakthroughs while simultaneously rewarding its people well for their service. Image source: Getty Images. 4) This money center bank doubles 6% of employees' contributions Banking giant Citigroup (NYSE:C) offers employees a 100% match on the first 6% of their salaries contributed to their retirement plans. The company also kicks in an automatic contribution of up to 2% of employees' salaries. Citigroup wasn't the fastest bank to recover from last decade's financial crisis, but now that it's again able to generate billions in profits, the bank looks to be back on much more stable financial footing. Image source: McDonald's. 5) This fast-food icon serves up to 7% Fast food giant McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) offers its employees a three-to-one match on the first 1% of their salaries contributed to the plan, plus a one-to-one match on the next 4%. The company may also make discretionary contributions to employees' accounts; in recent years, it kicked in an extra 2%. In an industry not known for high wages, a strong 401(k) match like that is a great way for employees to get more out of their work than just their paycheck. A sample Mastercard credit card with a biometric reader. Image source: Mastercard.  6) This credit card company hands out as much as 7.5% Credit card giant Mastercard (NYSE:MA) offers employees a 125% match on the first 6% of their salaries deferred into their retirement plan. That works out to as much as 7.5% of employees' salaries. It can also make a discretionary contribution of up to 1.25% of employees' salaries. Each time someone swipes or inserts a Mastercard credit card for payment, some of the fees Mastercard collects find their way into the pockets of employees in the form of that 401(k) match.

The company also makes its own contribution between 7% and 15% of employee salaries to the retirement plan, regardless of whether employees contribute. That generous plan contribution means employees can get as much as 20% of their salary put toward their 401(k). Philip Morris International can offer such a generous retirement plan thanks to its popular and addictive product lines, which help to assure repeat sales. Image source: Getty Images. 8) Another generous credit card company, this one with a 6% match Credit card behemoth Visa (NYSE:V) offers a two-for-one match on the first 3% of salary employees contribute to their 401(k)s, giving employees an additional 6% of their pay. Like Mastercard, Visa makes money every time someone uses one of its cards to make a payment, and the huge volume of transactions it processes around the world enables the company to offer its employees that generous benefit. Image source: Getty Images. 9) This innovative manufacturer offers 3% plus a 5% match 3M (NYSE:MMM), the maker of Post-it notes, Scotch Tape, and much more, offers employees a dollar-for-dollar match on the first 5% of their salary deferred to their 401(k)s. In addition, the company puts an automatic 3% toward employees' retirement plans. That's as much as 8% on top of their paychecks that employees can have funneled into their 401(k)s. 3M's diversified product lines help it assure that it has the revenue to afford such generous match levels, along with other retiree benefits including pre-Medicare medical savings accounts to help those who retire before age 65 pay for healthcare.

Reuters SHANGHAI - China is expected within days to carry out the maiden test flight of a home-grown passenger jet built to meet soaring Chinese travel demand and challenge the dominance of Boeing and Airbus. The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai and could be cleared for takeoff as early as Friday, according to state media. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it's going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China's aviation industry," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country's first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and successfully docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of up to 5,555 kilometers (3,444 miles). LONG WAY TO GO China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion.  But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock held on the market by Boeing and Airbus. "This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy," said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines as it looks to get sales off the ground. COMAC had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it will take time, but said that over the next century China will become a world aviation player. "You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC," he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC's first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. LONG HAUL AMBITION The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying Chinese domestic routes as it still lacks the crucial US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. The C919's first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) of the US and France's Safran. During a visit to COMAC in 2014, President Xi Jinping said not having a homegrown plane left China at the mercy of foreign industrial groups, state media reported at the time. China last August launched a new multi-billion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919's first flight, it will still need to pass a series of tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can sell the aircraft. China also has for years been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for both the ARJ 21 and the C919, without result. azk/dma/lth/kb © Agence France-Presse Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  SHANGHAI   C919   COMAC   Boeing   airbus   /overseas/05/02/17/china-welcomes-asean-summit-declaration-on-south-china-sea /overseas/05/02/17/us-china-talk-firmer-un-response-to-north-koreas-missiles-diplomats /news/05/03/17/palace-defends-russia-china-ties-as-distrust-among-filipinos-remains /video/news/05/02/17/duterte-gustong-magkaroon-ng-joint-military-exercises-ang-china-pilipinas /video/focus/05/02/17/pulse-asia-maraming-pinoy-ang-walang-tiwala-sa-china LATEST NEWS MOST READ Jeron upbeat of D-League title chances with new team May 04, 2017 How Migz Villafuerte helped GF Rachel Peters in pageant Q&A May 04, 2017 Hindi namatay ang pangarap: Senior citizen passes 2016 Bar exam May 04, 2017 THROWBACK: This little girl is now a beauty queen May 04, 2017 Mining audit review pushes through despite Lopez exit May 04, 2017 TINGNAN: Barko ng Coast Guard na pupuntang Benham Rise May 04, 2017 Central bank sees 'very little basis' to change monetary policy May 04, 2017 Inflation seen picking up for 6th straight month in April May 04, 2017 PH losing at least P328-B annually due to malnutrition: report May 04, 2017 Dave Bautista: 'Blade Runner 2049' is better than the original May 04, 2017 Mungkahi ni 'Bato': Matataas na kalibre ng baril para sa mga pulis May 04, 2017 Teo to embassies: Coordinate with PH before issuing travel advisories May 04, 2017 'Mahiwagang salamin' ni Boy Abunda, magbabalik May 04, 2017 PH eyes helicopters, drones vs illegal fishers May 04, 2017 NBA: Spurs rout Rockets to tie series May 04, 2017 Kwentong tagumpay: Dating janitor, abugado na Lea Salonga, Pokwang hit those who insult single mothers How the CA voted on Gina Lopez appointment IN PHOTOS: 10 inspiring celebrity single moms 'Na-ano lang': Sotto twits Taguiwalo for having children out of wedlock Walang solian ng korona sa 'Binibini' CA rejects Lopez as environment secretary Veteran actor Romeo Vasquez dies Bar 2016 topnotcher bares 'secret weapon' PANOORIN: Boy Abunda, naluha dahil kay Daniel at Karla Sex after 60: Posible pa ba?

China last August launched a new multi-billion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919’s first flight, it will need to pass tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can be sold.

The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai and could be cleared for takeoff as early as Friday, according to state media. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it's going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China's aviation industry," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country's first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and successfully docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of up to 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles). - Long way to go -China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion.  But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock held on the market by Boeing and Airbus. "This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy," said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines as it looks to get sales off the ground. COMAC had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it will take time, but said that over the next century China will become a world aviation player. "You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC," he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC's first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. - Long-haul ambition -The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying Chinese domestic routes as it still lacks the crucial US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. The C919's first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929.

After the C919's first flight, it will still need to pass a series of tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can sell the aircraft. China also has for years been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for both the ARJ 21 and the C919, without result. SourceAgence France Presse Business Comments 0 Comment

The House Finance Committee heard public testimony on the measures Tuesday. The bills are a tweaked version of bills introduced in previous years that never gained traction in the Democratic-controlled House but have received renewed interest after another round of Boeing layoffs were announced last month. “For me, this is a matter of taxpayer accountability,” Democratic Rep. Noel Frame, the sponsor of one of the bills, said at the hearing. In a 2013 special session, the Legislature approved a suite of tax incentives aimed at Boeing and the aerospace sector meant to ensure that the 777X was produced in Everett. Most of the tax breaks first were approved in 2003 and set to expire in 2024, but the new legislation extended them until 2040. Those tax breaks are expected to save the aerospace giant more than $8 billion in taxes through 2040. But Frame noted that since that time, the company has shed more than 12,000 jobs in the state. In the past year alone, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its workforce by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements. At the end of March, the division employed nearly 74,200 people, down from more than 83,000 at the end of 2015. Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations, said that any change to their tax incentives “would prevent Boeing from being able to respond to future market challenges.” “Subsidized foreign competitors and fewer wide body purchases across the industry have resulted in significant competitive pressure on every order,” he told the panel. He also noted that the company recently had to re-­adjust expected production of the 777 from eight planes each month to a planned rate of five planes a month. Frame’s bill would require Boeing to meet an annual employment baseline of 70,000 jobs in Washington in order to qualify for its preferential business and occupation tax rate. Boeing’s .2904 percentage rate is significantly lower than tax rates for other sectors. Under Frame’s bill, if Boeing’s annual employment level falls below 70,000 jobs, but above 67,500, its rate would increase to .387. If the level falls to 67,500, the rate would raise to the level that the vast majority of the manufacturing sector pays, .484 percent. Additionally, a tax credit the company could previously claim is reduced by 50 percent if the employment level falls below 70,000, but above 67,500 — if it falls below that level, no credit would be allowed. Any money regained by the state would go into an education account. The Legislature is in special session to address education funding as part of an overall two-year state budget that must be in place by the end of next month to avoid a partial government shutdown. Last year, Boeing announced that it saved $305 million through state tax breaks in 2015. It was the first time the company has been required by law to publicly disclose such information due to new requirement under a tax-incentive transparency law passed in 2013 that affects Boeing and hundreds of other aerospace firms in the state. At the time, the company also said it invested more than $13 billion in the state in 2015 — citing tens of millions in community contributions as well as tuition for employees seeking continuing education. McSherry pointed to that data in his testimony before the panel. “Boeing has kept its word to Washington,” he said. Republican Rep. Richard DeBolt, the sponsor of the second measure, said he felt that lawmakers needed to re-examine their policy related to the tax break. Under his bill, if the company did not maintain a seven-year average of 75,000 positions, the preferential tax rate would expire in mid-2024. Any money recouped would go to career and technical education, a new worker readjustment program and a small business tax credit account. “I have not seen the investment into the Boeing employees we thought we would get,” he said earlier in the week. “It seems every time we turn around, more are leaving.” Democratic Rep. Kristine Lytton, the chairwoman of the committee, said a decision has not yet been made on whether the bill will receive a vote. She said as lawmakers continue to try and reach a consensus on the budget, the exemption is worth a look.

But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock held on the market by Boeing and Airbus. “This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy,” said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines as it looks to get sales off the ground. COMAC had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it will take time, but said that over the next century China will become a world aviation player. “You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC,” he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC’s first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. Long-haul ambition The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying Chinese domestic routes as it still lacks the crucial US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. The C919’s first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (GE) of the US and France’s Safran. During a visit to COMAC in 2014, President Xi Jinping said not having a homegrown plane left China at the mercy of foreign industrial groups, state media reported at the time. China last August launched a new multi-billion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919’s first flight, it will still need to pass a series of tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can sell the aircraft. China also has for years been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for both the ARJ 21 and the C919, without result.

The 737-10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the market for narrow body jets. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane’s landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is separately talking to airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. In all, it is said to anticipate a market of 1,000 of the planes. “Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,” a spokesman said. “No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleArik Resumes Flight Operations To Maiduguri, May 9 Next articleAfrica Loses $50bn To Illicit Financial Flows Annually -Minister admin RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Business AMCON Injects N1.5bn In Arik Air Business Rivers Monarch Urges Local Economy Dev Through Cottage Industries Business Oil Sector Stablility Excites Buhari, NNPC Business C’River Commissioner Inspects Road Projects Business Edo Promises To Tackle Housing Sector Challenges Business NDDC Boss Salutes Workers’ Resilience Amid Tough Economic Challenges Stay connected 63,665FollowersFollow 2,846SubscribersSubscribe - Advertisement -Tweets by @TheTideNewspape Archives Archives Select Month May 2017  (153) April 2017  (831) March 2017  (961) February 2017  (825) January 2017  (897) December 2016  (427) November 2016  (496) October 2016  (870) September 2016  (674) August 2016  (583) July 2016  (962) June 2016  (696) May 2016  (648) April 2016  (813) March 2016  (580) February 2016  (594) January 2016  (726) December 2015  (508) November 2015  (144) October 2015  (356) September 2015  (334) August 2015  (948) July 2015  (831) June 2015  (737) May 2015  (436) April 2015  (690) March 2015  (783) February 2015  (879) January 2015  (808) December 2014  (675) November 2014  (771) October 2014  (903) September 2014  (619) August 2014  (783) July 2014  (752) June 2014  (796) May 2014  (801) April 2014  (889) March 2014  (863) February 2014  (678) January 2014  (995) December 2013  (804) November 2013  (614) October 2013  (789) September 2013  (591) August 2013  (570) July 2013  (750) June 2013  (656) May 2013  (433) April 2013  (801) March 2013  (895) February 2013  (747) January 2013  (687) December 2012  (735) November 2012  (714) October 2012  (720) September 2012  (797) August 2012  (927) July 2012  (856) June 2012  (792) May 2012  (765) April 2012  (751) March 2012  (933) February 2012  (681) January 2012  (660) December 2011  (536) November 2011  (663) October 2011  (649) September 2011  (677) August 2011  (651) July 2011  (858) June 2011  (404) May 2011  (370) April 2011  (113) March 2011  (215) February 2011  (497) January 2011  (617) December 2010  (445) November 2010  (393) October 2010  (505) August 2010  (234) July 2010  (680) June 2010  (1000) May 2010  (644) April 2010  (526) March 2010  (521) February 2010  (175) January 2010  (604) December 2009  (660) November 2009  (846) October 2009  (617) September 2009  (131) August 2009  (244) July 2009  (546) June 2009  (106) February 2009  (22) The Tide Newspaper is the most respected source of news and information for readers in Nigeria , with the latest stories on politics and current affairs, business and technology, sports, culture and the arts, as well as the popular citylife supplement, with nightlife news, restaurant reviews and top events.

The quarterly and half-yearly performance stats are 11.11% and 29.35% respectively. The performance (Year to Date) is currently at 18.16%. The current operating margin for The Boeing Company is at 6.50%. The return on assets for The Boeing Company stands at 5.70%, (ROA – calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the company’s total assets –  illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets). The dividend yield stands at 3.11% while the payout ratio is 60.40%. At present the return on equity (ROE) stands at 571.30% and the debt to equity is at 113.67.

A simple definition of the simple moving average: The simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the ‘noise’ by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. The earnings per share growth rate for this year stands at 2.30% and 9.62% for the coming year.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday American Airlines Group Inc. is about to give coach passengers even less legroom. The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches (76 centimeters) on its newest Boeing 737 jetliners, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 Max jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American’s effort marks the latest push by U.S. airlines to cram more passengers onto each plane by taking advantage of new, slimmer seat designs that are supposed to maximize room for a passenger’s knees even as rows move closer together. America’s newest contribution to the so-called densification trend will begin in the third quarter when the carrier takes delivery of its first 737 Max planes. "These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout," Freed said in an interview. "We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers." He declined to identify which rows will have the least legroom or how many total seats will be on the Max.  advertisement | advertise on newsday American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 Max planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. The airline is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said.  American raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. "Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product," he said. "There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others." The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats, and an unspecified number of Main Cabin Extra seats with added legroom. The spots with less pitch — or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it — won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. Southwest Airlines took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta Air Lines took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the space between rows on the 737 Max.  american BusinessHow United, other airlines rank for performance, complaints Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 MAX planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. The airline is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said. American raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. “Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product,” he said. “There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others.” The MAX will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats, and an unspecified number of Main Cabin Extra seats with added legroom. The spots with less pitch — or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it — won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. Southwest Airlines took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta Air Lines took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the space between rows on the 737 MAX.   Most Read Spectacular video: Small plane crashes in Mukilteo MUKILTEO — Nobody was seriously injured Tuesday when a small plane crashed… May 3rd, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins and Dan Catchpole Lakewood High School grad getting a shot at the NFL It was perhaps the worst day of Dustin Stanton’s football career.

Sources tell CNN bathrooms will also be smaller. Sean Dowling (@seandowlingtv) has more. Media: Buzz60 American Airlines Group Inc. is about to give coach passengers even less legroom. The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches on its newest Boeing Co. 737 jetliners, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 Max jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines.

Having more seats means American can sell more lower-priced tickets. “They may be choosing to play hardball with the ultra-low-cost carriers,” Bender said in an interview. “If you’re not getting extra revenue from business fliers, you have to get more money from people flying in economy, and you can’t get more from people flying in economy unless you put in more seats.” American is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said. The airline raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. “Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product,” he said. “There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others.” Cabin Spaces The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats.

The changes may also further split coach passengers from those flying in business or first class, Bender said.  “The extremes are becoming more extreme” in air travel, he said. “I would believe those who are willing to pay a premium are going to get enhanced service.” Southwest Airlines Co. took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta took similar steps three years ago.

Speaking to Jane's , Rutherford said Boeing has based its decision on the USN's apparent desire to cut down some of the operational performance parameters of the weapon, especially when compared with similar missile programmes of record the company already has with the service. "We're seeing a deleting of capability," he said, adding that it made no sense to try to win a missile system for the USN surface fleet that did not fully leverage a weapon already being developed for the service's aircraft.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Boeing’s $40M Missile Getting Workout Amid North Korea Tensions ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Boeing’s $40M Missile Getting Workout Amid North Korea Tensions By Matthew Rocco Published May 03, 2017 Defense FOXBusiness Facebook Twitter Comments Print video The U.S. Air Force launches another ballistic missile test Inside the U.S. Air Force's Minuteman III ballistic missile launch The U.S. fired another Boeing (BA)-made Minuteman III missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, the second test of the nation’s nuclear arsenal in the past week amid escalated tensions with North Korea. Continue Reading Below “It’s efforts like these that make nuclear deterrence effective,” Col. Craig Ramsey, 576th Flight Test Squadron commander, said in a press release announcing the test mission. The nuclear-capable Minuteman III was built in the 1970s with a price tag of $7 million. In current dollars, the Minuteman III would cost more than $40 million. The Air Force has made several upgrades to the Minuteman III, including modern targeting systems, since the missile’s initial production run. A team of Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen from the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, conducted Wednesday’s test launch shortly after 3 a.m. ET. Malmstrom Air Force Base is one of three bases in the U.S. that house Minuteman III ICBMs. The Air Force has approximately 450 of the long-range missiles in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Crew members are on alert 24 hours a day, year-round. The intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) traveled about 4,200 miles from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. In addition to the Minuteman III tests, the U.S. completed the installation of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile battery in South Korea earlier this week. Also, the U.S. Navy recently deployed a strike group led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the region.

Pitch, or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it, will slip to 30 inches on the 737 Max from 31 on the Boeing 737-800s now in American’s fleet, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. The 29-inch pitch on the three rows moves American close to the 28-29 inches offered on ultra discounters Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American joins other carriers that have taken advantage of new, slimmer designs that try to maximize room for a passenger’s knees even as rows of seats move closer together. The effort, called densification, enables carriers to put more travelers on each plane and boost revenue. “These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout,” Freed said in an interview. “We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers.” Freed declined to identify which rows will have less pitch or how many total seats will be on the Max. American, which has 100 of the aircraft on order, is scheduled to get the first one in the third quarter. It will receive four this year and 16 in 2018. Similar Changes The airline is considering similar changes for any new 737-800s, Freed said. American’s current 737-800s have 160 seats. “Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers as good product,” he said. “There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others.” The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats, and an unspecified number of Main Cabin Extra seats with added legroom. The 10 seats with less legroom won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but no extras like assigned seats. Southwest Airlines Co. took advantage of new slimline designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the pitch on the Max. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

The C919 will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on its first flight on Friday, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) said. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said. The C919 signals the country's entry into the global aviation market as a strong competitor, analysts said. In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the government. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. "Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight," COMAC said. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. It has 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China, and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, twenty-one customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China's first regional commercial aircraft, the ARJ21, began commercial operation in June 2016.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The company will shrink the space between most rows to 30 inches (76 centimeters) on its newest Boeing Co. 737 jetliners, spokesman Joshua Freed said Wednesday. That’s an inch less than on its existing 737-800 planes. At least three rows on the new 737 Max jets will have only 29 inches, moving the world’s largest carrier closer to the offerings of deep discounters such as Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines. American’s effort marks the latest push by U.S. airlines to cram more passengers onto each plane by using new, slimmer seat designs that are supposed to maximize room for a passenger’s knees even as rows move closer together. America’s newest contribution to the so-called densification trend will begin in the third quarter when the carrier takes delivery of its first 737 Max planes. “These are well-designed seats built for this kind of a layout,” Freed said in an interview. “We believe we’re still providing a good product for customers.” He declined to identify which rows will have the least legroom. The Max will have 172 total seats, including 36 in Main Cabin Extra, a higher-priced option with more leg room than the rest of the coach section. American will receive four of the narrow-body 737 Max planes this year and 16 in 2018. It has 100 on order with Boeing. Challenging Discounters The change may signal that American is ready to challenge the super-discount airlines for customers rather than battle with Delta Air Lines Inc. in particular over business travelers, said Alan Bender of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. Having more seats means American can sell more lower-priced tickets. “They may be choosing to play hardball with the ultra-low-cost carriers,” Bender said in an interview. “If you’re not getting extra revenue from business fliers, you have to get more money from people flying in economy, and you can’t get more from people flying in economy unless you put in more seats.” American is considering similar changes for any new 737-800 planes, Freed said. The airline raised the seat count on its 737-800s to 160 from 150 starting in 2015. It also had increased seats on its wide-body 777-200 jets to 289 from 247. “Just like every airline, with every new plane you look to have an efficient layout that makes use of the space on board and provides customers a good product,” he said. “There is some variability today on many fleets within coach cabins at our airline and others.” Cabin Spaces The Max will retain a first-class cabin with 16 seats. The spots with less pitch -- or the distance from the back of one seat to the same spot on the one in front of it -- won’t be part of American’s Basic Economy fare, which comes at a lower price but with no extra frills. The changes may also further split coach passengers from those flying in business or first class, Bender said.  “The extremes are becoming more extreme” in air travel, he said. “I would believe those who are willing to pay a premium are going to get enhanced service.” Southwest Airlines Co. took advantage of new slimmer designs to add six seats to most of its 737s as part of a cabin refurbishing in 2012, and Delta took similar steps three years ago. CNN earlier reported American’s plans to reduce the space between rows on the 737 Max. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The review was completed by Boeing in February and follows BAE Systems’ CDR of the system’s electronic warfare (EW) suite carried out at the end of 2016. BAE Systems Electronic Combat Solutions vice-president and general manager Brian Walters said: “Our entire team is driven by the importance of providing this enhanced EW technology to our warfighters in a timely manner. "The EPAWSS is designed to improve mission effectiveness and survivability of the aircraft against current and emerging threats." “EPAWSS provides a critical capability, and it is our mission to provide this on or ahead of schedule.” BAE Systems was selected by Boeing in October 2015 to develop a new EW system as part of a programme to develop EPAWSS for F-15, which is scheduled to be in service until 2040. The EPAWSS is designed to improve mission effectiveness and survivability of the aircraft against current and emerging threats. It will replace the current F-15 tactical electronic warfare suite (TEWS), which has been in service since the 1980s. This all-digital system is claimed to improve aircraft protection with advanced electronic countermeasures, radar warning, and increased chaff and flare capability. It offers geolocation, situational awareness, and self-protection solutions to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats in signal-dense and highly contested environments.

This article does a good job of sketching the problem. Here it is, succinctly: TRANSCOM doesn’t have enough ships, airborne tankers or cargo aircraft to get a large number of troops to a battlefield and sustain them. Last week I was at a conference where I linked up with an old friend who is a retired Australian Army reserve officer. He remains active in Australia’s military and foreign policy community. After the conference ended we went to one of my favorite Texas cafes. We discussed North Korea and Asian security then got to talking about C-17s — what fabulous planes they are and how we don’t have enough of them. Australia bought two of the last big batch Boeing manufactured. It has eight in service. My friend said he knows Australia and the U.S. both need more C-17s. For that matter, so do Canada, Great Britain and NATO. (If our list sounds parochial, remember the conversation was between an Australian and an American. FWIW, NATO’s Heavy Airlift Wing has three C-17s.) There is simply no other transport plane that can do what it does. Unfortunately, Boeing built its last C-17 Globemaster III in late 2015. Here’s an extract from the Defense Industry Daily article on the Aussie’s C-17 buy: Australia is a big country. Coast to coast distances are roughly the same as New York to Los Angeles. Or, to put it another way, you could drop Europe on top from Lisbon, Portugal to the Russia-Ukraine border. Tactical transport aircraft like the C-130J Hercules and the C-27J Spartan are necessary within the country, and Australia’s role as a regional stabilizer and a Western country extends its circles of influence and concern to locations far beyond its shores. An intratheater transport was necessary, and Australia’s government sums up their choice as follows: “One C-17A can carry up to four C-130 Hercules loads in a single lift, and cover twice the distance in three-quarters of the time of a C-130.” The plane’s tactical advantage and combat loads: C-17s can even operate from unpaved, unimproved runways, though this is rarely done. The potential for minor but expensive damage from flying rocks or other hazards makes air forces reluctant to do it, unless there’s some compelling need. The C-17 is designed to airdrop up to 102 paratroopers and equipment. In Australian terms, it can also carry one 60-ton M1 Abrams tank as well as loads ranging from 5 Bushmaster external link infantry vehicles to 3 Tiger reconnaissance/attack helicopters external link. “Compelling need” means soldiers on the ground need the equipment right now.

The C919 will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on its first flight on Friday, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) said. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said. The C919 signals the country's entry into the global aviation market as a strong competitor, analysts said. In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the government. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. "Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight," COMAC said. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. It has 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China, and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, twenty-one customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China's first regional commercial aircraft, the ARJ21, began commercial operation in June 2016. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

CALGARY — WestJet Airlines has set out a plan to expand both internationally and into ultra-low cost offerings that has raised concerns from some analysts about being overly ambitious. The company said Tuesday it has ordered 10 Boeing Dreamliners with the option for 10 more, that will allow it to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and Europe with higher-end offerings such as lie-flat seating. The move comes as WestJet is also moving ahead with a plan to launch a separate ultra-low-cost brand that will start with 10 planes and offer a bare-bones service. Combined, the new avenues of thrift and luxury set the company up for a new era of growth, said chief executive Gregg Saretsky at WestJet’s annual meeting Tuesday. “The opportunity to expand both in the low-cost space, while at the same time growing our long-haul business, is something that creates a platform for future growth that has been unprecedented in our 21-year history,” he said. National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen responded to the plan by lowering his rating of WestJet to underperform, citing in part the company’s overall ultra-low-cost strategy, the significant money that will be needed to expand abroad and the complications of doing both at the same time. “We are concerned WestJet has too many new strategic initiatives underway simultaneously, which could impair successful execution,” wrote Doerksen in an analyst note. WestJet shares have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly a month. They were at $22.03 in mid-afternoon trading, down 81 cents or about 3.6 per cent. Saretsky said at the annual meeting that WestJet’s recent experience of starting its Encore regional brand sets it up well for the task. “It’s a lot of work, but only three years ago we started a brand-new airline, which has grown from nothing to 45 aircraft, so I believe we have all the foundations to make starting two new initiatives really quite doable,” he said. Doerksen said in his note, however, that international routes add a greater degree of complexity and that while the actual cost of the 10 new planes is likely much lower than the list price of $7.4 billion, it is still significant. WestJet has reduced some of the complexity of the plan by spacing out the launches, with the first Dreamliner 787s not scheduled to be delivered until 2019, well after it expects to launch its discount brand. The ultra-low-cost carrier, or ULCC, should be in operation by early next year with a no-frills structure modelled from the likes of European carriers Ryanair and easyJet. “The focus on the ULCC is to have the absolutely, rock-bottom entry fare, and then you pay as you consume for all the other products and services,” Saretsky said on the conference call. Saretsky said the new discount airline’s costs would be about 6.5 cents per available seat mile, compared with 10 cents for its WestJet operations, as it does away with free extras like snacks and squeezes more travellers into the planes. The new offering will focus on leisure travel routes not served by WestJet to avoid cannibalizing its own business, with Saretsky saying one of the target markets is the 5.5 million flights Canadians take from airports just across the U.S. border. The company is also pushing to lower costs across its operations, with plans to add another row of seats to its to its existing 737-700s and 800s, and to shift more customer service online and away from call centres. WestJet’s expansion plans come as the company faces another pilot union drive, with voting set to begin on whether to join the Air Line Pilots Association. The plans also come as the company emerges from a tough quarter after a record number of weather interruptions, pushing first-quarter net earnings down to $48.3 million or 41 cents per share from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share last year. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

[NYSE: SPR] has reported first quarter 2017 financial results driven by strong operating performance, the company said. Spirit´s first quarter 2017 revenue was USD 1.7bn, up by 1% compared to the same period of 2016, primarily driven by higher production deliveries on the Airbus A350 XWB, partially offset by lower production deliveries on the Boeing 777 program. Spirit´s backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2017 was approximately USD 46bn, with work packages on all commercial platforms in the Boeing and Airbus backlog. Operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was USD 214m, compared to USD 267m in the same period of 2016, primarily due to higher favorable changes in estimates recognized during the first quarter of 2016, which were USD 42m higher when compared to those recognized in the current period. First quarter reported EPS was USD 1.17, compared to USD 1.29 EPS in the same period of 2016. The EPS impact from favorable changes in estimates was USD 0.19 per share more in the first quarter of 2016 than in the current period, based upon the statutory tax rate. Spirit AeroSystems designs and builds aerostructures for both commercial and defense customers. The company operates sites in the US, UK, France, and Malaysia. Its core products include fuselages, pylons, nacelles and wing components for the world´s premier aircraft.

Why is the number 2,147,483,647 important? Source: BBC Date: 06-05-2015 Time: 02:05:58:pm A surprisingly simple bug afflicts computers controlling planes, spacecraft and more – they get confused by big numbers. As Chris Baraniuk discovers, the glitch has led to explosions, missing space probes and more. uesday, 4 June 1996 will forever be remembered as a dark day for the European Space Agency (Esa). The first flight of the crewless Ariane 5 rocket, carrying with it four very expensive scientific satellites, ended after 39 seconds in an unholy ball of smoke and fire. It’s estimated that the explosion resulted in a loss of $370m (£240m). What happened? It wasn’t a mechanical failure or an act of sabotage. No, the launch ended in disaster thanks to a simple software bug. A computer getting its maths wrong – essentially getting overwhelmed by a number bigger than it expected. How is it possible that computers get befuddled by numbers in this way? It turns out such errors are answerable for a series of disasters and mishaps in recent years, destroying rockets, making space probes go missing, and sending missiles off-target. So what are these bugs, and why do they happen? Imagine trying to represent a value of, say, 105,350 miles on an odometer that has a maximum value of 99,999. The counter would “roll over” to 00,000 and then count up to 5,350, the remaining value. This is the same species of inaccuracy that doomed the 1996 Ariane 5 launch. More technically, it’s called “integer overflow”, essentially meaning that numbers are too big to be stored in a computer system, and sometimes this can cause malfunction. Failure to launch A full investigation of the Ariane incident found that a process left over from software in the previous generation of rockets, Ariane 4, had captured an unexpectedly high reading for the sideways velocity of the newer, faster vehicle – and the Ariane 5 rocket’s software couldn’t handle this high figure. A self-destruct sequence was initiated. A couple of seconds later, the rocket was history, as the video below shows. Such glitches emerge with surprising frequency. It’s suspected that the reason why Nasa lost contact with the Deep Impact space probe in 2013 was an integer limit being reached. And just last week it was reported that Boeing 787 aircraft may suffer from a similar issue. The control unit managing the delivery of power to the plane’s engines will automatically enter a failsafe mode – and shut down the engines – if it has been left on for over 248 days. Hypothetically, the engines could suddenly halt even in mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration’s directive on the matter states that a counter in the control unit’s software will “overflow” after this specific period of time, causing an error. Although scant details have been released – the FAA and Boeing declined to comment for this article – some amateur observers have pointed out that 248 days (when counted in 100ths of a second) is equal to the number 2,147,483,647 – which is significant. How so? It just so happens that 2,147,483,647 is the maximum positive value that can be stored by a “32-bit signed register”, commonly installed on many computer systems. On Ariane, by comparison, the software was using a "16-bit" space, which is much smaller and only capable of storing a maximum value of 32,767. Puzzling limit Numbers are infinite, so why choose such limited storage spaces for them? The answer is that computers have traditionally demanded efficiency in all things. Storage space used to be much more costly than it is today and processing larger values took longer. If you kept to certain limits, software was expected to run more smoothly. Rocket guidance systems do a lot of critical number crunching very quickly, so these overheads certainly matter. The problem with that, as the Ariane 5 proved, is that such limitations aren’t always foreseen as problematic. “We have to recognise that in software we are always approximating reality,” explains Bill Scherlis, a software expert at Carnegie Mellon University. “There’s always an engineering trade-off between the cost of having a more precise representation and the benefit of the efficiency.”   (Credit: Getty Images)   Mathematician Douglas Arnold at the University of Minnesota includes the Ariane 5 incident on a web page entitled “Some disasters attributable to bad numerical computing”. Arnold also notes the 1991 case of a Patriot missile which failed to intercept an Iraqi Scud attack on a US Army barracks during the Gulf War. In this case, an overflow error meant that the missile defence system mis-tracked the incoming Scud projectile, which was travelling at 1.7km/s, and instead scanned an area of airspace more than 500 metres from the target. As a result, the Scud hit the barracks, killed 28 soldiers and injured a further 98 people. The full details of the computer bug in this case are quite complicated, but software engineer Andrew Lum at the University of Sydney has posted a helpful explanation of what happened, including diagrams of the Patriot system. Gangnam glitch Not all rollover glitches are as destructive as these examples, but they do frequently create unexpected effects. For example, in the video game Civilization, an unanticipated bug in this vein caused the peaceful character Gandhi to become uncharacteristically hostile. When players chose a certain mode to play in, the value which defined Gandhi’s aggressiveness rolled backwards past zero to the maximum. Consequently, he would threaten players with nuclear weapons at every turn – to the great amusement of many players. And in December, it was reported that Gangnam Style, the most popular video of all time on YouTube had “broken” the website’s view counter. The counter had apparently been programmed to only run to 2,147,483,647 – again, the maximum positive value of a 32-bit signed register. It turned into good PR for YouTube, which updated the view count storage while wallowing in worldwide coverage of the site’s most popular ever video. The new maximum is well over nine quintillion.   Psy's Gangnam Style is credited with 'breaking' video-sharing website YouTube (Credit: Getty Images)   Scherlis notes that the previous limitation reveals the expectations of the original programmers who built YouTube. “Certainly, when YouTube’s software was first developed I think it was probably hard for any developers or designers to imagine that they would overflow [this number],” he says. It’s often this sort of assumption, which initially may seem reasonable, that causes problems years down the line. The most talked about overflow bug in history, which many will remember, was the much-hyped Millennium Bug. Although largely considered a damp squib, the Y2K problem did cause some headaches. With Y2K, the bug was simple. What happens when you record years by the last two digits? 1900 becomes identical to 2000. Many people realised that this would cause confusion for any computer systems storing year values in this manner. As a result, a lot of advice was published in advance to programmers so that they could update systems before or on 1 January 2000. Planes did not fall from the sky, but there were some interesting consequences. For instance, radiation detection equipment in the Japanese prefecture of Ishikawa crashed at midnight; 150 slot machines at a race track in Delaware failed; and several websites gave the new date as “1 January 19100”.   Fears of a global meltdown from the 'Millennium Bug' turned out to be unfounded (Credit: Getty Images)   Twelve years later, in a similar incident, a 105 year-old woman in Sweden named Anna Eriksson received a letter inviting her to start pre-school because software had been designed to contact individuals born in “07”. The designers intended this for people with a birthdate in 2007, not 1907 as was the case for Ms Eriksson. An inability to correctly recognise the year even led to millions of German credit and debit cards becoming unusable on New Year’s Day in 2010. The year 2038 About 15 years ago programmer William Porquet had the idea of thinking ahead to yet another crucial date – GMT 3.14.07am on Tuesday 19 January 2038. This is the moment when the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 will exceed one of the maximum values of many computers’ date and time registers nowadays. Like the Millennium Bug, failure to prepare for this could result in computer crashes. “It was in 1999 that I first wrote about this,” comments Porquet. “I acquired the domain name 2038.org and at first it was very tongue-in-cheek. It was almost a piece of satire, a kind of an in-joke with a lot of computer boffins who say, ‘oh yes we’ll fix that in 2037…’ But then I realised there are actually some issues with this.”   Will a January morning in 2038 see computers crashing all over the world? (Credit: Getty Images)   Porquet is concerned about old bits of software that nobody tends to anymore – on long-established networks, or on old hardware being used in remote parts of the world. How many of them will still be in use 23 years from now and what consequences that could have is anybody’s guess. “A lot of computer systems,” notes Porquet, “can be caused to fail in a predictable manner. But this is failure in an unpredictable manner.” Glitch in time Markus Kuhn, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge explains that time related bugs create interest partly because their consequences are unpredictable, but also because they are “not unexpected” and that people are able to speculate about what will happen when the fateful date arrives. Kuhn thinks that the 2038 problem will be less significant than Y2K because the Millennium Bug has prepared the computer industry to make the necessary fixes. Indeed, that’s all part of William Porquet’s plan. “I hope it’s something that will take me out of semi-retirement for a very large sum of money,” he says, only half joking.   The speed of Earth's rotation may also cause a slight time change that could crash computers (Credit: Getty Images) For Kuhn, the interesting time problem for computers of the moment is not an overflow glitch per se, but it is one this coming June. The year 2015 will be a second longer than 2014 thanks to a move to correct the discrepancy between astronomical time (the time on Earth based on our planet’s rotation) and atomic time (the most accurate known time-keeping method, in terms of counting seconds). While atomic time, which is to be adjusted with this year’s leap second, is mind-bogglingly precise, it is actually slightly out of sync with astronomical time because the Earth’s rotation is very gradually decelerating. Geological events such as earthquakes can cause changes in the speed of this rotation meaning that the addition of leap seconds, unlike leap years, is variable. The last one was in 2012 and crashed many computers. Fortunately, says Kuhn, we’ll hopefully be more prepared than we were in the past. It seems like no matter what we do, certain numbers and calculations will always confuse computers, causing malfunction – or worse. “We’ve learned a lot from the Y2K experience and other similar events,” notes Scherlis. “But the reality in which we are always making approximations and having to navigate an engineering trade off? That is with us forever.” What others are reading NDC must stay in opposition for 16 years – Kweku Baako Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Association of alcohol manufacturers commends FDA probe into Adonko Bitters saga Students get ‘free passco’ on Vodafone’s Instant Schools portal Latest Stories Akufo-Addo advocates for 24-hours opening of Ghana-Togo borders I’m sorry – Nii Noi begs Akufo-Addo A rewarding career in Corporate Communications Expect power in three hours - GRIDCO confirms 70% plunged in darkness Coventry graduate recounts life-changing commitment to tackling terrorism LIFESTYLE Doctors unhappy with queueing to use theatre ODD NEWS Father drinks his daughter's breast milk to help beat bowel cancer AUTOS The Junction Mall Auto Show TECHNOLOGY Galaxy S8: The Smartphone Evolution We Dreamt About OBITUARY Madam SARDIS EMMAROSE OSEW ELECTIONS EC holds district elections in Nkoranza after 2015 disruption Home News Politics Business Sports World News Opinion More Sections Entertainment Elections Health Odd News Automobile Technology Media Audio on Demand Photo Gallery Online Radio Videos On Demand Live TV Social RSS Feeds Twitter Facebook Youtube Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Myjoyonline Advertise Online Team Privacy Policy Services Contact us Feedback Our daily bread

Source: Boeing The US Army and Boeing have told Jane's that Poland has not selected the AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopter for its Kruk (Raven) requirement, despite the country being included in a related contract announcement posted on the US Department of Defense (DoD) website on 28 April. Poland is known to be considering the AH-64E Apache Guardian as one of a number of future attack helicopter types, and the country's inclusion alongside other current international operators of the type in a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contract for Apache sighting systems appeared to indicate that a selection had indeed taken place. "Lockheed Martin, Orlando, Florida, was awarded a USD332,136,017 firm-fixed-price foreign military sales (United Kingdom, Egypt, India, Korea, Republic of Indonesia, Taiwan, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Poland) contract for Modernised Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor System, subcomponent production, and technical services for the Apache attack helicopter," the notification read. However, in response to a request for clarification from Jane's, a representative for the US Army said that Poland has not yet opted to buy the Apache, while Boeing noted that the country has not made any decision regarding its Kruk requirement. While Jane's has been assured that no decision has taken place, however, neither the US Army nor Boeing said why the country had been included in the Apache sighting system contract. The Polish Ministry of National Defence (MND) had not responded to the request by the time of publication. Poland is currently in the midst of a helicopter recapitalisation effort to replace its Warsaw Pact-era inventory, with the emphasis currently on acquiring a new special forces type to replace its ageing Mil Mi-8/17 'Hip' platforms, as well as an anti-submarine warfare type to replace the Mil Mi-14 'Haze'. It had been understood that the Mi-24 'Hind' assault platforms to be replaced by the new Kruk attack helicopter programme would remain in service for the foreseeable future. Want to read more?

The first test flight of the C919 airliner is scheduled to take place Friday from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, China's official news agency Xinhua reported Wednesday. With the C919, China is aiming to become one of the world's top makers of large commercial aircraft. The 168-seat plane is roughly the same size as Airbus's A320 and Boeing's 737-800, which are the most popular airliners on the planet. The C919 completed its final ground trial less than two weeks ago, demonstrating it can safely stop on the runway if something goes wrong. The maiden flight will be a key milestone for the plane's manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac. But the C919 still has a long way to go before it will be ferrying passengers. The aircraft is likely go through months or years of demanding certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. Comac will also need to gain the trust of airlines in China and beyond by showing the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. Getting the C919 to this stage has taken a long time. China's state-owned airlines first signed up to buy the plane in 2010, and it was initially slated to enter service last year. But the prototype wasn't unveiled until November 2015, and the program has been beset by technical delays as China has gotten to grips with airliner development. Even companies with decades of experience such as Boeing and Airbus have faced major delays on high-profile projects, underscoring the difficulty of bringing new jets to paying passengers. The C919 is set to put China among the few nations that have developed large homegrown airliners -- the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. But so far, demand for the jet has remained local: orders are almost entirely from Chinese carriers for domestic flying. That could still add up to a lot of business: China is on track to surpass the U.S. by 2030 as the world's largest commercial aviation market.

The C919, manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), is China's first-ever domestically-built large passenger jet. The plane is more than a decade in the making and was first unveiled to much fanfare back in November 2015. The single-aisle, 168-seat aircraft is scheduled to depart from our very own Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday as long as the weather conditions are favorable, according to a COMAC spokesperson. Last year, COMAC told the media that it had already received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 customers. Of course, the majority of the orders were from government-run companies like Air China, China Southern and China Eastern Airlines. Meanwhile, 10% of orders have come from overseas from airlines in Africa, Germany and Thailand. The hope is that someday the aircraft can become internationally competitive with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Back in 2015, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told CNBC that he would have "no hesitation at all in buying Chinese airplanes," as long as they were made to the standard that he wanted. "There is nothing wrong with buying Chinese. You use an iPhone, which is made in China. Designed by somebody else, but made in China. I think it would be good for this (Boeing/Airbus) monopoly to be broken," he added.

The Dow added 36 points, with Boeing and Apple contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 gained 0.12 percent. The Nasdaq eked out another record close at 6,095.37.

One of the key metrics investors will be watching out for in those earnings will be iPhone sales. The tech giant makes most of its money from iPhones — and even if it meets estimates of 52 million, that's not a lot more than the 51 million it reported a year ago. Wall Street also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve, with the central bank kicking off a two-day monetary policy meeting. The Fed, however, is not expected to shift monetary policy when their meeting concludes. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. That said, investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed's plan to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. "The FOMC has always encountered turbulence when trying to 'land the plane.' Reducing an inventory of $4.5T of fixed income securities to something far more stable presents the biggest challenge of the most protracted and complex tightening cycle facing the central bank since its founding in 1913," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note to clients. Load Error The U.S. central bank raised rates at its March meeting, pushing the overnight funds rate to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Investors also looked ahead to a slew of economic data due later this week, including the April jobs report, which is due Friday. "We have some more data later this week, so I'd expect [relative] volatility to pick up in the coming days," said Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. Equities closed mixed on Monday after a brief shock stemming from President Donald Trump's comments on breaking up the big banks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he was "looking at that right now." Stocks declined sharply after Trump's remarks but managed to rebound. "That seems pretty alarming, but if you look beyond the headlines, the Vix sustained those levels for most of 2004 and 2005," said Faraday's Weller. "So it may not be indicative that a top is near." In economic news, U.S. automakers will be releasing monthly sales numbers throughout the day. Earnings season continued, with Mondelez and Gilead Sciences set to report after the bell.

EVERETT — The Boeing Co. added a sixth test plane to its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. The aerospace giant expects the additional tanker will help it complete remaining ground and flight tests. Boeing is slated to deliver the first KC-46 Pegasus tanker to the U.S. Air Force later this year, later than the contract’s deadline to hand over the first 18 aircraft. The new test plane will verify that electromagnetic fields produced by radars and other systems will not affect the KC-46s, which are based on Boeing’s 767 and assembled in Everett. So far, the KC-46 test aircraft have flown more than 1,600 flight hours. “Adding another tanker will help us to become even more efficient and significantly improve our ability to complete test points going forward,” said Jeanette Croppi, Boeing KC-46 tanker test team director.   Most Read Spectacular video: Small plane crashes in Mukilteo MUKILTEO — Nobody was seriously injured Tuesday when a small plane crashed… May 3rd, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins and Dan Catchpole Lakewood High School grad getting a shot at the NFL It was perhaps the worst day of Dustin Stanton’s football career.

Updated 6 hours ago I urge the person responsible for the editorial “Trump's Ex-Im flip-flop” to log on to exim.gov as a starting point for some real research regarding the Export-Import Bank. Apparently, President Trump did his own research or listened to a trusted adviser and then switched his position regarding Ex-Im because he is not prone to political cronyism. Ex-Im is one of a mere few of our government agencies that actually works for American companies that employ American workers. Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar were mentioned in the editorial. The hundreds of subcontractors to each of those companies, many in Western Pennsylvania, that benefit from the export business of those three companies, were not mentioned. If the business didn't go to Boeing, it would go to Airbus of France, the only real competitor of Boeing. A similar scenario would occur in the instances of GE and Caterpillar. All three of those companies represent some of the best of American business expertise. Perhaps others should rethink Ex-Im and be as honest as Trump about really wanting to help America. Joseph G.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Aerospace suppliers spending huge sums to boost capacity Dan Catchpole Wed May 3rd, 2017 9:34pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. LAKE STEVENS — The shop floor at Cobalt Enterprises in Lake Stevens is abuzz with activity as half-million-dollar machine tools turn metal blocks into airplane parts. The company has expanded at breakneck speed in recent years — consistently growing for several years until 2016, when it doubled in size. The aerospace supplier expects to do about $25 million in sales this year. With airplane makers cranking up production and military spending on the rise, there is plenty of work for Cobalt and other aerospace suppliers. To win it, suppliers are under intense pressure to keep costs down, quality high and deliveries on time. Companies across Snohomish County are spending huge sums to add production capacity in recent years. Boeing has spent more than $1 billion to set up 777X production and assembly work at its Everett plant. Over the past five years, Cobalt Enterprises has spent up to $15 million on getting bigger and better, co-owner Paul Clark said. Last year, Cobalt opened a bigger machine shop in Lake Stevens, while keeping its Granite Falls location. Later in the year, it added an Everett plant when it took over Integrated Aerospace Manufacturing, which itself sprang from a 2015 merger of three local suppliers — Vector Industries, Polaris Machining and Quality Manufacturing. Cobalt focuses on making relatively smaller batches of intricate pieces — a high-skill, small-run niche. “We do the work that others don’t want to take on or can’t do,” Clark said. Commercial aerospace makes up about 60 percent of its work, military and space takes up another 30 percent and non-aerospace work is about 10 percent. It currently is making parts for a new football helmet designed to cut down on concussions, made by Seattle-based VICIS. Cobalt typically makes parts for other, bigger aerospace suppliers. Its customers have wanted more finished parts, he said. Larger suppliers “want more packaged or kitted parts,” rather than pieces that have to be assembled. Adding production capabilities and doing more assembly work has made Cobalt more competitive. Also, “by being larger, you might have a better chance to hold onto work that might shift otherwise,” Clark said. Taking over Integrated Aerospace Machining gave Cobalt new capabilities, such as stretch forming aluminum — a production process that uses powerful machines to pull and push the metal into shapes. In Lynnwood, Crane Aerospace &Electronics added industry-leading test and production operations for its fuel flow meters, which track the amount of fuel going to a jet engine. The meters already are in many of the major engines in production, including the CFM International LEAP engines used on Boeing’s 737 MAX, Airbus’ A320neo and Comac’s C919. The expanded plant, which is expected to start production later this year, will ensure the company keeps pace with production schedules and that its products get on new engines being developed in the years ahead, said Dave Dickson, a marketing executive for Crane Aerospace &Electronics. Like many aerospace investments in the region, Crane’s expansion was less about adding workers and more about increasing capabilities to win future work. The company still employs about 800 people in Lynnwood, about as many as it did when it broke ground on the expansion in late 2015. Many suppliers are investing huge sums to get more efficient and competitive. Esterline extensively overhauled its Korry Electronics plant near Paine Field in 2015 to create a factory based on the principles of lean manufacturing, an organizational approach that stresses flexibility, responsiveness and efficiency. Last year, B/E Aerospace finished moving its operations around Snohomish County into a new factory that opened near Paine Field in 2013. Zodiac Northwest Aerospace Technologies plans to move later this year from its home near downtown Everett to a new plant in an industrial park on the city’s east side along the Snohomish River. The company confirmed the move, but would not comment on details.

Source: Shutterstock Passengers that fly in American Airlines Group Inc’s economy class will be the ones facing less legroom. The economy class will have three rows on the flight dropping from 31 inches of legroom to 29 inches. Other passengers in American Airlines Group Inc’s economy class will also see their legroom decrease. Instead of the drop to 29 inches, these seats will reduce legroom from 31 inches to 30 inches. These changes are coming to the airline’s new 737 Max jets from Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). The seats with less legroom won’t cost less than other economy seats. American Airlines Group Inc is reducing legroom in its economy class to fit more seats on its jets. This will allow it to have more than 170 seats on each flight. Current flights offer 160 seats. The changes won’t affect its main cabin economy seats or its first class ones. The changes will also reportedly include a smaller bathroom, reports CNNMoney. American Airlines Group Inc’s changes are parts of its efforts to better compete with cheaper airlines, such as Spirit Airlines Incorporated (NASDAQ:SAVE). The changes also make sense as Americans aren’t interested in paying more for extra conveniences. A study from 2016 found that only 21% of Americans would pay extra for more benefits while flying. It also found that only 17% would pay extra for wider seats and 7% would pay more for carry-on space, MarketWatch notes. AAL stock was up slightly as of Wednesday afternoon, but is down 5% year-to-date.

Friedman: “Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding?” Olivier Douliery TNS Syndicated Columnists May 03, 2017 8:30 PM Thomas L. Friedman: Is Trump crazy like a fox, or is he just crazy? By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN New York Times News Service LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Has the first 100 days of the presidency made Donald Trump nuts? I don’t ask that question as a doctor. I don’t do medical diagnoses. I ask it as a newspaper reader. You read all of Trump’s 100-day interviews and they are just bizarre. Out of nowhere Trump tells us he would be “honored” to negotiate directly with the leader of North Korea, after weeks of threatening war. Out of nowhere he says he would consider a gasoline tax to pay for infrastructure. Out of nowhere he says he is considering breaking up the nation’s biggest banks. He also insists that his Obamacare replacement legislation contains protections for people with pre-existing conditions that it doesn’t. There’s barely a dictator in the world for whom he doesn’t have praise. And he repeats a known falsehood — that Barack Obama wiretapped him — and tells reporters they should go find the truth, when, as president, he could get the truth from the FBI with one phone call, and when pressed whether he stands by that allegation, answers, “I don’t stand by anything.” Is this a political strategy unfolding or a psychiatric condition unfolding? I don’t know — but it tells me that absolutely anything is possible in the next 100 days — both good and bad. Trump is clearly capable of shifting gears and striking any deal with any party on any issue. Trump was always going to be an unpredictable work in progress because he did no homework before coming to office — which is why he now tells us that he’s finding so many problems more difficult than he anticipated — and because he didn’t know most of his Cabinet members. They’re sort of a pickup basketball team, bound not by a shared vision but by a shared willingness to overlook Trump’s core ignorance, instability and indecency and serve in key jobs as much to restrain him as to be guided by him. Allies and adversaries saved Trump and the country from some of his most extreme, ill-considered campaign promises. His foreign policy team stopped him from tearing up the Iran nuclear deal and moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. North Korea’s missile-loving dictator saved him from declaring China a currency manipulator and starting a trade war with Beijing, because Trump discovered he needed China to restrain North Korea and avoid a war. Boeing and General Electric restrained Trump from getting rid of the Export-Import Bank, which would have left U.S. exporters at a big disadvantage. The federal courts prevented him from imposing his Muslim ban. Border-state Republicans blocked his Mexico wall. U.S. farmers, whose exports to Mexico have soared since NAFTA was signed, dissuaded him from walking out of that trade deal. As for the next 100 days, who will protect us? Myself, I am not counting on the Democratic Party. It’s too weak. On the issues I care about most, I’m actually counting on California. I believe California’s market size, aspirational goals and ability to legislate make it the most powerful opposition party to Trump in America today. How so? Trump wants to scrap Obama-era standards requiring passenger cars to average about 51 mpg by 2025; today it’s just under 37 mpg. But as the Los Angeles Times recently noted, under the Clean Air Act, California “can impose emissions standards stronger than those set by the federal government, and a dozen other states have embraced the California rules.” More than one-third of the vehicles sold in the United States are subject to the rules California sets. Trump can deregulate U.S. automakers to make more gas guzzlers all he wants, but they can’t if they want to sell cars in California. Trump can sue, but that will take years. California has far more clean energy jobs than there are coal jobs in all of America, and California’s now nation-leading growth rate in jobs gives the lie to everything Trump says: You can have gradually rising clean energy standards, innovation, job creation and GDP growth — all at the same time. “We have made it very clear — we will protect our economic prosperity and our values from Trump,” said state Senate leader Kevin de León, whose Legislature recently hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to defend it against Trump suits. Holder is California’s (and my) secretary of defense.

Thursday, May 4, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Homemade passenger jet set for 1st flight By Zhu Wenqian (China Daily)    08:49, May 04, 2017 Two technicians inspect an engine on the C919, China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, after a taxiing test on Wednesday.[Photo by Yin Liqin/China Daily] China's first domestically produced single-aisle passenger jet, the C919, is expected to take to the sky for its maiden flight on Friday, as the country endeavors to meet soaring domestic travel demand and break the global market duopoly of Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. The debut flight is set to take place at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, subject to weather conditions, the C919's Shanghai-based manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, said on Wednesday. Soon after it was established in 2008, COMAC began the research to develop the twin-engine C919, which would be used for medium-haul flights with 158 to 174 seats. It is expected to compete with the updated Airbus A320 and the new-generation Boeing B737. China has its own military and regional aircraft manufacturers, and the development of the airplane serves as a key index to assess the country's industrial and technical manufacturing capacity. "The first flight of the C919 signals that China will be able to make a significant breakthrough for the country's civil aircraft manufacturing industry, and it could have the opportunity to break the monopolies of Boeing and Airbus," said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, a large Chinese civil aviation website. Despite the promising future, Lin said the C919's entry to the market won't occur soon. The date it goes into operation is expected to be between 2020 and 2022. So far, COMAC has received 570 orders for the C919 from 23 clients, including domestic airlines such as the State-owned Air China, China Southern and China Eastern; and private airlines Hainan Airlines and Sichuan Airlines. China Eastern will be the first to take delivery. Overseas orders account for about 10 percent of the total, including airlines from Germany and Thailand and others from the Asia Pacific region and Africa. Boeing earlier predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total delivery for China from global aircraft manufacturers. "While the program has faced its share of challenges－like any development program of this size－the results speak for themselves," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific, one of the C919's suppliers. "The C919 is a sleek, modern and efficient airplane. It is ready to compete on a global scale, heralding China's ambitious plans to grow and develop its domestic air transportation industry with the help of international partners." COMAC said last week it has started the research to develop a widebody commercial jet with Russia for delivery within 10 years.

That was when the state plane manufacturer known as Comac delivered its first passenger aircraft, a 90-seat jet called the  ARJ21. May 2017 may prove bigger still. Comac is about to stage its first test flight of a larger plane, the C919, that will take on Boeing Co. and Airbus SE in an industry segment that’s forecast to generate sales in China alone of more than half a trillion dollars over the next 20 years. 1. What do we know about the new plane? The C919 will seat 158 to 174 people, six abreast, and is intended to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families of planes in the so-called single-aisle market. Comac describes its venture as “ the flower of modern industry.” 2. When will this flower bloom? If all goes according to plan, the C919 could be in service as soon as 2019. The test flight, which is expected to take place May 5, has already been pushed back from last year. And the ARJ21 took six years to go from first flight to commercial operation. Comac executives say the C919 will “ definitely” get there faster than that. 3. Should Boeing and Airbus be worried? It’s too early to say. But it seems credible that a China-based competitor could take a significant chunk of business, since the Chinese market is on course to become the world’s largest as measured by aircraft and passengers. China will need 6,810 planes, worth more than $1 trillion, through 2035, according to Boeing estimates. And the country is forecast to overtake the U.S. as the largest air travel market in terms of passengers around 2024. 4. Where does the C919 fit in? Single-aisle planes are already the No. 1 segment of the Chinese market, but what’s about to come is breathtaking: Planes in that category are forecast to generate about $535 billion, or 75 percent, of passenger jet sales in China over the next two decades, Boeing says. Currently, the single-aisle category is dominated by Boeing and Airbus. 5. Has anyone bought the C919 yet? Comac, or Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., had orders and commitments from 23 buyers for 570 aircraft as of November 2016. Other than the leasing unit of General Electric Co., all are from local companies. China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s second-largest airline, will be the first carrier to take delivery. Terms haven’t yet been disclosed. 6. Will the C919 fly outside China? That’s the plan. China’s aviation officials are pushing for bilateral agreements on airworthiness with U.S. and European regulators by the end of 2017 to pave the way for domestically produced aircraft such as the C919 to be flown in those markets. 7. So is this bad news for U.S. and European aviation? Hardly. While aircraft makers may lose market share, suppliers stand to gain. The C919 counts as many as 16 global corporations as suppliers, including GE and Honeywell International Inc. 8. Why is China so late to the party? The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up China has tried developing passenger jets; its first efforts began in 1970. There was the Y-10, which failed to go anywhere after test flights in the 1980s. Then there was the MD-82, a joint development that collapsed after Boeing acquired China’s partner, McDonnell Douglas. There may be more impetus for a breakthrough now, given the burgeoning domestic market and China’s ambition to upgrade its economy to high-level manufacturing, which hinges on projects such as aircraft.

Imagine William Shatner floating through space. Image: Adrian Jones/REX/Shutterstock By Lance Ulanoff2017-05-03 21:15:55 UTC Hard to believe, but William Shatner has never been to space or in zero gravity. That's right, the man who played Star Trek's Captain Kirk for 28 years and has been a NASA booster for decades has kept his feet firmly planted on the ground. SEE ALSO: That time William Shatner played a sleazy sea captain in 'Kung Fu' All that changes in August when Shatner boards the G-Force One, Zero-G's gravity-defying airplane, a Boeing-727 which makes a series of in-flight parabolic arcs to recreate, if only for a few moments, weightlessness. The company announced Shatner's upcoming flight on Wednesday. Shatner is going where no William Shatner has gone before as part of a Star Trek-inspired fan experience promoted by Zero-G and Roddenberry Adventures, an exploration company founded by the late Gene Roddenberry's son Rod Roddenberry. Shatner confirmed to Mashable that this will be his very first Zero-G flight and the closest he has ever come to actual spaceflight. When we asked if he was concerned about vomiting (a common land-lover response to weightlessness), Shatner told us he hadn't thought about it. Even though the flight will coincide with the annual Star Trek convention in Vegas, Shatner's Zero-G flight has no affiliation with the Star Trek brand or CBS, which own owns the Star Trek franchise (and is relaunching the series later this year). "Going weightless will turn a dream into reality,” said Shatner in a release. “I’ve always wondered what it would be like to actually explore the Final Frontier and now I have the opportunity to experience zero gravity firsthand. It will be an incredible adventure.” Picture William Shatner and you right here — if you have almost $10,000 to spare. Image: Zero-G Zero-G confirmed that the 86-year-old actor and author may be taking just one weightless flight out of Las Vegas on August 4. But there will be witnesses. Zero G is selling a handful of tickets to fans who want to float by the serial tweeter's side (and hopefully not lose their lunch on him). However, before you start packing your bags, you may want to consider the price: a whopping $9,950 per seat. Typically, Zero-G flights run around $5,000, but Roddenberry Adventures is throwing in some weightless swag and a video of that zero-gravity moment with Shatner to sweeten the deal. This is not Zero-G's first brush with celebrity. George Takei once flew on Zero-G's 727. Probably best not to share that with Mr. Shatner.

PDT May 03, 2017 The Boeing plant in Everett, Wash. (Credit; KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST OLYMPIA, Wash.- A House panel is considering two measures that would tie Boeing's eligibility for tax breaks to the amount of people they employ in Washington. The House Finance Committee heard public testimony on the measures Tuesday. The bills are a tweaked version of bills introduced in previous years that never gained traction in the Democratic-controlled House, but have received renewed interest after another round of Boeing layoffs were announced last month. The sponsors - one Republican, the other a Democrat - say they want to provide accountability to taxpayers. Lawmakers and others expressed frustration that thousands of jobs have been lost or moved out of state since the Legislature passed a suite of incentives nearly four years ago that benefited Boeing. Those tax breaks could save the aerospace giant more than $8 billion in taxes through 2040.   © 2017 KING-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Brandon Roy shot near Los Angeles Families sue midwife Family harassed, police investigating as possible hate crime Portland May Day riot aftermath Car crashes into Salem tavern Portland budget funding new rental website No lump, no tumor, the breast cancer disguised as a skin rash Raw video: Aftermath of partial building collapse in Southeast Portland KGW.com Live Feed 25 arrested during May Day riot More Stories House to vote Thursday on GOP Obamacare repeal bill May. 3, 2017, 5:10 p.m. Another warm day ahead, thunderstorms expected in evening May. 3, 2017, 10:17 a.m. Fake service dogs are becoming a problem May. 1, 2017, 4:50 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings Weather Alerts Radars Live Cameras hyperlocal-radars More...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Curtiss-Wright Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results; Raises Full-Year EPS Guidance CHARLOTTE, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Curtiss-Wright Corporation (NYSE: CW) reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. First Quarter 2017 Highlights Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73, ahead of expectations; EPS included a discrete tax benefit of $0.09, as defined herein; Net sales of $524 million, up 4%, including 3% organic growth; Operating income of $51 million; Operating margin of 9.8%, including 110 basis point dilution from acquisitions; New orders of $644 million, up 2%, driving book-to-bill to 1.23; Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 7% from December 31, 2016; and Share repurchases of approximately $12 million. Full-Year 2017 Business Outlook Maintaining operating margin guidance range of 14.6% to 14.7%; Increasing EPS guidance by $0.10 to new range of $4.40 to $4.50, primarily due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 for share-based compensation; and Maintaining free cash flow guidance range of $260 million to $280 million. “Our first quarter results were ahead of our expectations as solid 4% top-line growth drove a stronger EPS performance than anticipated,” said David C. Adams, Chairman and CEO of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. “While our overall profitability was negatively impacted by the first-year purchase accounting costs associated with our recent acquisition of Teletronics Technology Corporation (TTC), we achieved higher organic sales and operating income growth in each of our segments in the first quarter.” “We are off to a solid start to 2017 and anticipate steady, sequential margin improvement over the remainder of the year. Our ongoing commitment to margin expansion is driving increased profitability and enabling us to continue mitigating several challenging end market conditions. Overall, we believe that our continued focus on delivering solid profitability and free cash flow, maintaining a balanced capital allocation and driving for top-quartile financial performance will continue to enhance shareholder value.” First Quarter 2017 Operating Results from Continuing Operations         (In thousands) 1Q-2017 1Q-2016 Change Sales $ 523,591 $ 503,507 4%  Operating income 51,227 57,263 (11%) Operating margin 9.8% 11.4% (160 bps)   Sales Sales of $524 million in the first quarter increased $20 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, reflecting a $15 million, or 3%, increase in organic sales, and a $10 million, or 2%, contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by $5 million, or (1%), in unfavorable foreign currency translation. Higher organic sales primarily reflect improved industrial demand in the Commercial/Industrial segment and higher AP1000 revenue in the Power segment. Higher Defense segment sales principally reflect the contribution from our recent acquisition of TTC, completed in early 2017. From an end market perspective, sales to the defense markets increased 5%, while sales to the commercial markets increased 3%, compared with the prior year. Please refer to the accompanying tables for a breakdown of sales by end market. Operating Income Operating income in the first quarter was $51 million, a decrease of $6 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year, primarily due to purchase accounting costs from the recent TTC acquisition in the Defense segment and higher non-segment expenses. These costs were partially offset by increased operating income in the Commercial/Industrial segment resulting from higher sales, as well as higher operating income on the AP1000 program in the Power segment. Operating margin was 9.8%, a decrease of 160 basis points over the prior year, reflecting the dilution from recent acquisitions partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives. Excluding 110 basis points in margin dilution from acquisitions, operating margin would only have been down 50 basis points to 10.9%, primarily due to higher non-segment expenses and changes in sales mix compared with the prior year. Non-segment Expense Non-segment expenses increased by $3 million compared with the prior year, principally due to higher foreign currency transactional losses. Net Earnings First quarter net earnings were nearly flat compared with the prior year, as lower operating income and higher interest expense were mainly offset by lower taxes. Our effective tax rate for the current quarter was 20.9%, a decrease from 31.0% in the prior year, principally driven by our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which resulted in a discrete tax benefit of $4.0 million. The adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior years’ results. Excluding this discrete item, our effective tax rate for the current quarter would have been 30.5%. Free Cash Flow       (In thousands) 1Q-2017 1Q-2016 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ (24,941 ) $ 70,260 Capital expenditures   (10,374 )   (8,825 ) Free cash flow $ (35,315 ) $ 61,435   Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was ($35 million) for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $97 million compared with the prior year. Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities decreased $95 million to ($25 million), primarily due to lower advanced payments on the AP1000 program and the unwinding of our interest rate swaps, which benefited prior year results. Capital expenditures increased by approximately $2 million to $10 million, related to the completion of the facility consolidation in the Commercial/Industrial segment. New Orders and Backlog New orders of $644 million in the first quarter increased 2% compared to the prior year, as higher orders within the Defense and Power segments were partially offset by lower orders within the Commercial/Industrial segment. Backlog of $2.1 billion increased 7% from December 31, 2016, due to gains in all three segments. Other Items – Share Repurchase During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 125,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $12 million. Full-Year 2017 Guidance The Company is updating its full-year 2017 financial guidance as follows:     Prior Guidance Current Guidance Total sales $2.17 – $2.21 billion No change Operating income $316 – $325 million No change Operating margin 14.6% – 14.7% No change Interest expense $40 – $41 million No change Diluted earnings per share $4.30 – $4.40 $4.40 – $4.50 Diluted shares outstanding 44.9 million No change Free cash flow $260 – $280 million No change   Notes: Full-year 2017 guidance includes the acquisition of TTC, which adds $65 million in sales to the Defense segment, and is breakeven on operating income and earnings per share, including purchase accounting costs. Full-year 2017 guidance reflects the impact of a discrete tax benefit of $4.0 million from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This change resulted in a $0.10 increase to our prior EPS guidance. A more detailed breakdown of the Company’s 2017 guidance by segment and by market can be found in the accompanying schedules. First Quarter 2017 Segment Performance Commercial/Industrial         (In thousands) 1Q-2017 1Q-2016 Change Sales $ 278,822 $ 274,727 1% Operating income 30,621 30,052 2% Operating margin 11.0% 10.9% 10 bps   Sales for the first quarter were $279 million, an increase of $4 million, or 1%, over the prior year. Organic sales increased 3%, excluding $4 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation. In the general industrial market, we experienced improved demand for industrial vehicle and industrial automation products, partially offset by reduced sales of severe-service valves serving the energy markets. Elsewhere, we experienced declines in the commercial aerospace market, primarily due to reduced sales to Boeing on the 737 and 787 programs. In the naval defense market, we experienced lower revenues on the Virginia-class submarine program, based on the timing of production. Operating income in the first quarter was $31 million, up 2% from the prior year, while operating margin improved 10 basis points to 11.0%. These improvements in operating income and margin reflect higher sales and improved profitability for industrial vehicle products driven by our ongoing margin improvement initiatives. This performance was partially offset by decreased profitability for industrial valves and surface treatment services, due to lower sales volumes. We also experienced lower profitability for sensors and controls products, due to unfavorable mix. Lastly, favorable foreign currency translation added approximately $1 million to current quarter operating income. Defense         (In thousands) 1Q-2017 1Q-2016 Change Sales $ 114,662 $ 105,391 9%  Operating income 11,155 16,845 (34%) Operating margin 9.7% 16.0% (630 bps)   Sales for the first quarter were $115 million, an increase of $9 million, or 9%, from the prior year. These results primarily reflect a $10 million contribution from our recent acquisition of TTC, partially offset by $1 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation. In the aerospace defense market, we experienced higher sales of data acquisition and flight test equipment on various fighter jet programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as higher sales of embedded computing products, most notably on the Global Hawk program. Those gains were partially offset by reduced sales on several military helicopter programs. In the ground defense market, we experienced higher sales of our turret drive stabilization systems to international customers. Operating income in the first quarter was $11 million, a decrease of $6 million, or 34%, compared with the prior year, while operating margin decreased 630 basis points to 9.7%. This performance was primarily driven by purchase accounting costs related to our recent acquisition of TTC. Excluding the effects of this acquisition, operating income increased 2%, while operating margin increased 20 basis points to 16.2% compared with the prior year, driven primarily by the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives. Power         (In thousands) 1Q-2017 1Q-2016 Change Sales $ 130,107 $ 123,389 5% Operating income 16,540 14,628 13% Operating margin 12.7% 11.9% 80 bps   Sales for the first quarter were $130 million, an increase of $7 million, or 5%, from the prior year. These results primarily reflect higher AP1000 revenues within the power generation market, primarily on the 2015 China Direct contract, partially offset by lower aftermarket sales supporting currently operating nuclear reactors. In the naval defense market, higher revenues for development on the new Columbia class submarine program were partially offset by lower revenues on the CVN-79 aircraft carrier program as production is nearing completion, and the Virginia-class submarine program, based on the timing of production. Operating income in the first quarter was $17 million, an increase of $2 million, or 13%, compared with the prior year, while operating margin increased 80 basis points to 12.7%. This performance was primarily driven by higher AP1000 revenues, as well as improved profitability in the aftermarket power generation business despite lower sales, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing margin improvement initiatives. Conference Call & Webcast Information The Company will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2017 financial results at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, May 4, 2017. A live webcast of the call and the accompanying financial presentation, as well as a replay of the call, will be made available on the internet by visiting the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.curtisswright.com.

Curtiss-Wright believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the Company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. Curtiss-Wright encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: Organic Revenue and Organic Operating Income The Corporation discloses organic revenue and organic operating income because the Corporation believes it provides investors with insight as to the Company’s ongoing business performance. Organic revenue and organic operating income are defined as revenue and operating income excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and contributions from acquisitions made during the last twelve months.   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 vs. 2016 Commercial/Industrial   Defense   Power Total Curtiss-Wright Sales   Operating income Sales   Operating income Sales   Operating income Sales   Operating income Organic 3% 0% 0% 2% 5% 13% 3% (1%) Acquisitions 0% 0% 9% (34%) 0% 0% 2% (10%) Foreign Currency (2%) 2% 0% (2%) 0% 0% (1%) 0% Total 1% 2% 9% (34%) 5% 13% 4% (11%)   Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion The Corporation discloses free cash flow because it measures cash flow available for investing and financing activities.

Rear Adm Hill said the test has “been planned for a while” and was not intended as a provocation to North Korea or any other nation. Asked about the timing, Rear Adm Hill described June 1 as an approximate window for the test. The attempt to intercept a dummy target will take on symbolic importance whether it succeeds or fails, as North Korea ramps up its ballistic missile development and President Donald Trump vows to block Mr Kim Jong-un’s regime from developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the US. The next interception attempt will be the first since a successful test in June 2014. But, before that, two tests failed in 2010. The Missile Defence Agency has said its extensive efforts to fix flaws in the interceptor’s warhead have paid off. But the Pentagon’s weapons testing office has said the US$36 billion (S$50 billion) system of ground-based interceptors cannot yet be counted on to shoot down a nuclear-armed missile aimed at the US West Coast by North Korea or Iran. The network of radar and communications — combined with missiles based in California and Alaska — has demonstrated only a “limited capability to defend the US homeland from small numbers of simple (intercontinental ballistic missiles)”, said the testing office in its latest annual report. Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said the next test “takes on special significance because of the increased tensions in the world”. “Rather than being provocative, I see this as a move towards stability,” said Mr Franks in an interview. “If an enemy recognises we can knock down the first one or the second one or maybe the fourth or fifth one, they know that’s going to give us the time for an offensive response — and that is a deterrent in itself.” The US test will attempt to shoot down a target that replicates for the first time the speed, trajectory and closing velocity of an ICBM. Washington will also test avionics updates to the booster rocket built by Orbital ATK, which carries an improved version of a hit-to-kill conventional warhead made by Raytheon, said Missile Defence Agency officials. Boeing manages the missile defence system. Asked about the implications if the test fails, Mr Franks, a supporter of the missile defence system, said: “It definitely has significance. (But) if you ask Kim Jong-un, you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes.” BLOOMBERG mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ﻿From Trump’s Mar-a-Lago to Facebook, a national security crisis in the open  Extreme religious acts mark Good Friday in the Philippines “Fear of the future” fuels killings in Japan ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Tremendous’ Trump impersonator wins contest to host fake news show ‘Drunk’ American arrested over Japan flight brawl Zidane warns against Le Pen in France election run-off Yemen govt seeks U.N. oversight of port: prime minister Woman, 66, is fifth victim to die in Stockholm truck attack Without school, children of Mosul feared lost to poverty and conflict With fish and football, French presidential hopefuls woo the people Why South Korea is debating US anti-missile system White House defends Trump invitation to Duterte despite human rights criticism When Malaysian school authorities use the rod... and physically harm children Inside Today World No cause for alarm about Queen Elizabeth and Philip after royal staff called to meeting: source Iraqi army advances on Islamic State's Mosul enclave from northwest Malaysians launch petition to ban physical punishments in school Syrian armed opposition to return to Astana peace talks: RIA Thai rights lawyer faces up to 150 years in prison for royal insult Business French bank SocGen settles dispute with Libyan Investment Authority Asian stocks retreat, dollar holds near six-week high on hawkish Fed Oil eases, near weakest since late March on small U.S. stocks decline Herbalife CEO talks about obesity, vindication at Milken Conference Apple to create $1 billion U.S. advanced manufacturing fund Sports ‘Tai chi can be used in combat, but...’: Jack Ma speaks up over tai chi-MMA debate raging in China Evolution of kung fu: From hired killers to soldiers, the mafia, and finally an esteemed sport Totti to retire at end of season: Roma How the race for Europe is stacking up Singapore Floorball Association on road to recovery after financial scandal Entertainment Ed Sheeran to perform in Singapore in November The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye tops Eisner Award nominations Fox launches streaming service in Singapore Mediacorp bags 12 awards at New York Festivals Awards China’s all-girl pop band crushes hopes of besotted female fans About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 © Mediacorp Press Ltd.

Some speculate that North Korea could detonate a high-altitude nuclear weapon in space, setting off an EMP that would knock out electrical systems down below, with catastrophic results. But, experts are not convinced that this is how the scenario would pan out. According to nuclear non-proliferation expert Jeffrey Lewis, tests of such devices in the past were largely anticlimactic, and failed to produce the widespread electrical disruption that’s been predicted over the years. Scroll down for video  The expert points to a test conducted by the US in 1962 known as ‘Starfish Prime.’ At the time, the researchers launched a missile roughly 400 kilometers (248 miles) above the Pacific Ocean to see how a high-altitude attack would affect military equipment HOW EMP WORKS  EMP, or electromagnetic pulse weapons use missiles equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy. The energy causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. The aim is to destroy an enemy's command, control, communication and computing, surveillance and intelligence capabilities without hurting people or infrastructure.  Writing for New Scientist, Lewis argues that claims of societal collapse as a result of a North Korea EMP attack are ‘silly.’ The expert points to a test conducted by the US in 1962 known as ‘Starfish Prime.’ At the time, the researchers launched a missile roughly 400 kilometers (248 miles) above the Pacific Ocean to see how a high-altitude attack, which would trigger an electromagnetic pulse, would affect military equipment. The bomb was about 100 times larger than the one dropped on Nagasaki – but apart from ‘stunning visuals,’ the test was a ‘disappointment,’ Lewis writes. While some have claimed that Starfish Prime had dramatic effects down below, shutting off lights across millions of square miles and turning off cars, the expert says there was no evidence to support this. Instead, just one string of street lights failed in Honolulu. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Would you ride in a self-driving bus? Firm reveals plans to...

Share this article Share 34 shares Lewis also points to tests commissioned by the US Congress, in which 55 vehicles were exposed to EMP effects in the lab. And, even at the highest level, just six cars needed to be restarted. According to Lewis, fears of an EMP attack have been exacerbated by recent happenings. 'STARFISH PRIME' HIGH-ALTITUDE NUCLEAR TEST A view of Starfish Prime through thin cloud, is pictured, as seen from Honolulu The US launched a high-altitude nuclear test dubbed Starfish Prime on July 9, 1962. It was one of five high-altitude tests in a program known as ‘Operation Fishbowl.’ Researchers launched a Thor rocket carrying a W49 thermonuclear warhead, which was detonated at an altitude of 250 miles. The bomb exploded at a force of roughly 1.5 megatons of TNT, and was the largest nuclear test to be conducted in space. While the explosion caused a stunning display in the sky, including auroral effects, experts say the test did not cause electrical disruption below, as many have claimed.  And, this could be distracting from more pertinent threats. ‘An electromagnetic pulse is a real phenomenon, but we shouldn’t exaggerate its effects,’ Lewis wrote. ‘An atomic bomb detonated in a city would be – as we know from Hiroshima and Nagasaki – a much greater catastrophe. ‘Nuclear weapons are scary enough without the science fiction.’  Still, in recent years, the military has expressed its interest in developing EMP weapons.  While some have claimed that Starfish Prime had dramatic effects down below, shutting off lights across millions of square miles and turning off cars, the expert says there was no evidence to support this. A flash from the test can be seen in the image above, in Honolulu A solicitation from the Pentagon earlier this year called for a non-explosive electromagnetic pulse artillery shell capable of wiping out ‘a wide range of electronics, critical infrastructure, and computer-based systems.’ The non-kinetic system would first be incorporated into a 155mm projectile and later scaled down to enable the use of multiple shells, allowing for devastating electronic attacks that are delivered by standard munition but cause no physical damage. According to the solicitation, the weapon will be designed to be cost-effective and precise, launching the non-kinetic effects (NKE) from a close range to limit the affected area. BOEING'S 'CHAMP' WEAPON  In 2012, aircraft manufacturer Boeing successfully tested the weapon on a one-hour flight during which it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound. During Boeing's experiment, the missile flew low over the Utah Test and Training Range, discharging electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets, permanently shutting down their electronics. Boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled. Pictured is Boeing's Champ, or Counter-electronics High-powered microwave Advanced Missile Project, one of the EMP weapons that is under construction Although the project is shrouded in secrecy, experts believe the missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. Boeing's CHAMP takes out enemy electronics with pulse.  Essentially, such a weapon would render the target’s entire electronic infrastructure useless. And, as global forces work to develop these weapons, some experts are working to protect infrastructure from their effects. Engineers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have developed a type of concrete that could act as a shield against ‘doomsday’ electromagnetic pulse attacks. The conductive concrete both absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves to protect the electronics inside, and the creators say it could be used in new structures or applied through a spray-on method to retrofit existing buildings.   Read more: Would a North Korean space nuke really lay waste to the US? | New Scientist Munition-Delivered Non-Kinetic Effects (NKE) | SBIR.gov Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos Cute orangutan is freed by rescuers after TWO YEARS in a box Argentinian man spends $35,000 on surgery to become 'real-life elf' Tory voter Malcolm Baker confronts Lib Dem leader Tim Farron Heartwarming moment stray dog leads rescuers to her ten puppies People with facial differences open up about abuse they've suffered Playboy playmate Jaylene Cook shows off her island holidays Dramatic footage shows police shoot dead gunman Peter Selis Father pulls hysterical 'blinker fluid' prank on his two girls 'Erm, they will cost': Abbott's car-crash election interview Mortifying: Diane Abbott is played her toe-curling LBC interview Comey 'mildly nauseous' thinking FBI may have affected election 'I don't give a f***': Woman strolls through airport NAKED Entire Queen's household is called to 'highly unusual'...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Maybe he won’t save the world. But with a new doc and Netflix show, the Science Guy is, at the very least, saving his career John Semley May 3, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Bill Nye hosts National Park Foundation ‘View-A-Thon’ at Mashable on November 29, 2016 in New York City. (Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images) About thirty minutes into David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg’s new documentary Bill Nye: Science Guy, which made its international premiere this week at Toronto’s Hot Docs film festival, a montage of interviewees express a shared suspicion: Bill Nye is dead. For a generation coming of age in the mid-1990s, Nye was everywhere. In his trademark blue lab coat and bowtie, Bill Nye (“The Science Guy”) introduced kids watching his super-popular PBS show to the wild world of science, through zippily edited experiments, pop song parodies (like “AC/DC Charge” by Billy Ray Cyrcuits) and a welcome dose of comedy that enlivened the doldrums of elementary school science class. He was—at the risk of overstating it—the Michael Jordan of science. So where did he go? “It took me this long to find the right people to work with,” says Nye, who recently revived his Science Guy persona for his new Netflix talk show Bill Nye Saves The World. He rattles off a list of TV shows and documentaries he’s appeared in since the glory days of Bill Nye the Science Guy: BattleBots, The Eyes of Nye, 100 Greatest Inventions, and half a dozen more. He laments that these programs, worthy as they are, lacked the “pop” of the Science Guy show that made him a star. “The other problem was that these shows weren’t extensions of me,” Nye says. “Anybody could have hosted these shows and they would have come out fine. Whether you like him or not, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon has to be an extension of Jimmy Fallon. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has to be an extension of Stephen Colbert. Chelsea Lately has to be an extension of Chelsea Handler, or it just won’t work.” Bill Nye leads demonstrators on a march to the U.S. Capitol during the March for Science in Washington, U.S., April 22, 2017. (Aaron Bernstein/Reuters) Bill Nye Saves the World has plenty of pop—and plenty of Bill Nye. Back in the bowtie and lab coat, tinkering around with beakers and burners in front of live studio audiences—comprised largely by 20- and 30-somethings for whom Nye served as a de facto substitute science teacher—and a suitably catchy, repetitive theme song (courtesy rapper/producer Tyler, The Creator, no less). For the Science Guy himself, Bill Nye Saves the World is the realization of a lifelong ambition. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1977 and landing a lucrative engineering job with Boeing, Nye shifted gears, pursuing a career in comedy after winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest. “I spent a lot of time trying to write comedy, trying to write jokes, performing in comedy sketches,” he recalls. “In my day we studied The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. This was the grail, the big dream in the sky: to be Johnny Carson. And I mean, I’m there! I’m not Johnny Carson, but I’ve got my own talk show. Check me out, man!” That could very well be the pitch for Bill Nye Saves the World: “The Tonight Show for pop science.” There’s Nye’s commingling of comedy and science, pre-taped segments, and panel discussions with experts on a given subject. Every inch of the lavishly designed sound stage feels like an extension of Nye. It’s like a straight-up sequel to the beloved Bill Nye: The Science Guy. And that’s the problem. Nye still talks to his audience, who are now fully matured adults, as if they’re wide-eyed little kids watching PBS. As its host fist-bumps his correspondents, screams “Woohoo!” at one or another experiment, and creaks his way through dorky jokes, Bill Nye Saves the World is pandering to the point of feeling embarrassing. It also borders on irresponsible. Take episode four, “More Food, Less Hype,” which discusses genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Pulling off his best Dr. Frankenstein impression, Nye paints “this image of mad scientists mixing tarantula genes into eggplants!” He then dispatches a correspondent to a farmer’s market, in an obviously Kimmel-ish turn, to expose the ignorance of consumers and organic food activists when it comes to GMOs. It’s a classic example of building a straw man: reducing an argument to broad caricature in order to easily refute it. While some people may find genetically modified foods just straight-up “icky,” many of the larger concerns have less to do with the genetics and more to do with the economics, like how gargantuan agrochemical corporations like Monsanto exploit biological patents to exert a stranglehold on family farmers and other croppers not using Monsanto-branded seeds. It’s not necessarily about the bioethics of breeding more resilient soybean crops or growing larger strawberries; it’s about the corporate ethics of GMO giants rigging (or splicing) the game to bolster their bottom lines. It may be easy to excuse such lapses in argumentation. After all, Bill Nye is the Science Guy, not the Corporate Ethics Guy. And given how frequently Nye is attacked for his lack of actual scientific credentials—Alvarado and Sussberg’s new doc digs into this rather deeply, even showing archival footage of Sarah Palin undermining Nye’s scientific bona fides—it may be understandable that he wants to stick to the science, if only to bolster that perceived lack of credibility. “If Sarah Palin were to say, ‘I think Bill Nye is a first-class mechanical engineer,’ that would be troubling in a whole different way,” Nye says, laughing. “An endorsement from Sarah Palin is not a good thing.” Nye has been hearing these criticisms for so long that they roll off him like water off a duck’s back. Despite his prominence in the scientific community (or at least the pop scientific community), he’s less a “real scientist” than an accessible figurehead—a kind of science mascot. But the documentary levels an even harsher criticism at Nye—one he takes more seriously. It’s the accusation that his prominence, his persona, his whole Science Guy shtick, is a play for fame, the end-result of a wannabe comedian realizing his aspirations of stardom. “It made me feel bad,” says Nye of the claim that he’s only in it for the fame. “When you get laughs, it’s very exciting, as a comedian. When you see a student’s eyes light up, as a teacher, that’s also very exciting. When you don’t feel well, and you don’t want to perform, too bad. That’s the way it goes.” Still, he barely allows himself a moment to be ruffled by the apparent arraignment of his sincerity. “Yes!” he screams, through the phone, fully alive and unembarrassed. “I love being on television! Yes! I’m a performer! Yes! That’s me! The show must go on!” For Nye, science and superstardom seem one and the same. Even when his new show exhibits distasteful cajoling of its Millennial audience, or a lack of genuine scientific rigour (or indeed, a sense that he is actively shilling for Monsanto), it becomes difficult to blame, let alone dislike, Bill Nye. After all, he never claimed to be a real scientist. Only a Science Guy.

The Centre for Asia Pacific (CAPA), the Sydney-based aviation think-tank, in its report titled "Global Fleet and Financing Review 2017," also said that the airline is likely to opt for Boeing 777X for long haul operations. Vistara is a joint venture, in which Tata Sons owns 51 per cent stake and the rest is with Singapore Airlines. "Vistara is expected to be the next carrier to place a major order, of up to 100 aircraft before June, 2017, comprised of 50 narrow-bodies and 50 wide-bodies," CAPA said in its report today. This assumes significance in the backdrop of Vistara mulling launching international operations from mid 2018. The airline is expected to stick with Airbus for single-aisel equipment and is likely to opt for the 777X for long haul operations, the report said. When contacted, a Vistara spokesperson said that the airline does not comment on market speculations. "We don't comment on market speculations," the spokesperson said in response to a PTI query on the issue. The Delhi-based airline currently has 13 Airbus A320 aircraft in the fleet and it plans to take another seven (A320 Neo) planes by June 2018. The first of the seven A320 Neo planes is expected to be delivered to the airline this month. According to the report, the South Asia region is dominated by India, which accounts for 67 per cent of the total 742 aircraft in service. Also, India accounts for as much as 96 per cent of the 917 aircraft in the region, CAPA said adding India has one of the highest order book in service ratios in the world. Three of the eleven airlines -- Air India, IndiGo and Jet Airways - have a fleets of more than 100 aircraft. Gurgaon-based Budget carrier IndiGo alone has placed orders for 430 planes (in two separate orders of 180 and 250) with Airbus, a few of them have already been delivered to the carrier, while the other budget carrier GoAir has also placed orders for 144 planes with the European aviation major. Besides, Ajay Singh-promoted SpiceJet has also announced that it will purchase up to 205 new aircraft from Boeing with the order valued at Rs 1,50,000 crore.

Speaking at the IATA Wings of Change conference in Miami, Scholl said $33 million in funding secured last month—bringing Boom’s total financing to $41 million—removes monetary obstacles for the company, enabling it to build and flight test the “Baby Boom” prototype that will be a precursor to the full-size Boom aircraft. The full-size aircraft will be able to seat up to 55 passengers in an all-business class configuration, according to Scholl. The Baby Boom’s first flight is targeted for 2018, and the full-size Boom aircraft’s first flight is targeted for 2020 with a 2023 FAA certification goal. The Baby Boom, which is being built now, will be a third of the size of the planned full-size Boom aircraft. “Finally, the funding is not the problem,” Scholl said. “$41 million is not enough to get all the way through certification, but enough to build the first Baby Boom airplane and prove that it works.” Unlike the supersonic Concorde, which was so costly for airlines to operate that fares were largely unaffordable and led to its commercial demise, the Boom aircraft will be cost-efficient and affordable for passengers, Scholl said. “You could charge the same fares you’re charging in business class today and get the same margins or better,” he said. The full-size Boom aircraft will be priced at $200 million each, Scholl said. Maintenance costs on the airframe will be “very similar” to other carbon fiber aircraft, such as the Boeing 787, according to Scholl. He conceded that engine maintenance costs will be higher, although he emphasized that the engine will be a modified version of today’s turbofan jet engines and not an exotic new design. “None of this stuff is in a lab somewhere,” he said. “All of the technology being put into the Boom is flying on other aircraft today and the FAA knows how to approve it.” Scholl said the Boom aircraft would be viable on 500 daily routes globally and is generating interest from airlines. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic has taken options for the first 10 full-size Boom aircraft, and Scholl indicated additional agreements with airlines could be announced by the end of this year. “We get a lot of excitement from airlines all over the planet,” he said. “Getting there in half the time is a real differentiator for airlines.” Flying at a speed of Mach 2.2 over water (overland supersonic flying is currently prohibited by regulation in the US), the Boom aircraft could fly between New York and London in 3 hr. and 15 min.; between Miami and Santiago de Chile in 3 hr. and 48 min.; between San Francisco and Tokyo in 5 hr. and 30 min.; and between Los Angeles and Sydney in 6 hr. and 45 min. The transpacific flights would require a refueling stop since the aircraft’s nonstop range will be limited to 4,500 nautical miles. Although Scholl said it would be “irrational” for Airbus and Boeing to launch a commercial supersonic aircraft program now, he believes the established aircraft manufacturers will ultimately get into the game. “Will Boeing and Airbus do this? Eventually they’ll have to,” Scholl said. “But I think a startup is uniquely positioned to do this initially.” The overall market for a new supersonic passenger aircraft is “not quite” as large as the market for the 787, but it is “close,” Scholl said. He acknowledged that Boom will not be able to serve this 1,000-aircraft market by itself in the decade or so after the first Boom aircraft enters service. “Scaling production is going to be a challenge,” he said. “We’ll likely start with a lower-rate production capability and then ramp that over time.” Aaron Karp aaron.karp@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The country is outraged over the disparity of wealth and the commitment of our elected officials beholden to special interests. One of the largest special interest groups can be undeniably identified as the defense industry. The war on terror has been an unmitigated disaster if measured by the intent of defeating terror. In 2002 there were 725 people killed in terrorist attacks. In 2014 that number has grown to over 32,000 people killed. However, if measured by the results of business revenue generated by the defense industry you can see quite a different result. The cost of the war on terror has risen to more than $5 trillion. The defense industry is the primary recipient of those expenditures. Raytheon, the maker of tomahawk missiles used in Trump’s attack, the fourth largest military contractor in the U.S. receives 90 percent of its revenue from the U.S. government. Thomas Kennedy, CEO, was paid $22 million last year. The CEO of Lockheed Martin, received 78 percent of revenue from the federal government at $33.7 million. The CEO of Boeing, the largest government contractor, received $29 million and paid no income tax. U.S. special operations are deployed in over 105 countries more than 80 percent of all the other nations on Earth. American arms are shipped throughout the world, supplying the machinery of war in amounts greater than the next seven nations combined. The U.S. defense industry is really the main supplier of arms in every conflict throughout the world no matter who is defending or oppressing or otherwise waging war. War and its costs both in terms of human lives and personal misery and in destruction of wealth and infrastructure throughout the world have been subtly removed from the public consciousness by members of Congress who pay a political price for authorizing war. Truly much of the killing during war is done by robotic drones and fly-by bombings that do not differentiate between combatants and civilians. Bush and Trump and yes even Obama, can be seen heroically initiating war-like aggression that is illegally condoned without authorization by Congress. Identifying the defense industry and the business of war-making is an area where we, as progressives, can spend energy with the hope of seeing significant returns on our efforts simply because military spending represents such an overwhelming portion of our country’s budget and expenditures. The defense industry participates in many of the particular grievances the general public is outraged about. To gain a perspective, the $5 trillion mentioned above could pay for a living wage for every working person in our country. Or it could pay for free education for the next 50 years. The amount of cumulative resources spent waging war in the world is paramount in causing the destruction of environmental integrity. I know these are just words and what can we really do to have an effect? I don’t know, but if we begin to include these words into our movement, into our marches, into our and others, thoughts, these words might grow a consciousness of their own and take root and grow into a movement, into action, into progress, into policy shaping and effecting and building a world without war.   JOSEPH MAY Somerset FacebookTwitter Letters to the Editor Story Archive Search Recent Posts Garden Tour Terbijhe Print photography competition Building permits, April 24-28 Shooting victim’s identity released Residential burn permits now required Planners adopt plans to preserve biological/oak resources in county Rattlesnakes are on the move, take precautions to avoid a bite Placerville Police K9 assists with drug arrest Lowering the voter age would bring more uninformed voters to the polls Final snow survey finds water-rich snowpack Subscribe via Email Enter your email address to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email.

WestJet Airlines President & CEO Gregg Saretsky said Tuesday the new carrier "will have significantly lower cost on every line of that business."  (Larry MacDougal / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Wed., May 3, 2017 DALLAS—WestJet Airlines Ltd. began life 21 years ago as a low-cost airline in the Southwest Airlines vein: Low fares and minimal frills. Over the years, as it sought to compete and grow, the frills, fares, and costs grew along with it. Now, the Calgarybased carrier isn’t only headed back to its discount roots, it’s digging even deeper. The airline is planning to tackle the cheapest segment of the air-travel market by launching an ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) modelled on Ryanair. WestJet describes the move as defensive, fending off incursions from rivals and helping stem the flow of some 5.5 million Canadian leisure travellers who cross the border to fly bargain airlines such as Allegiant Travel Co. and Spirit Airlines Inc. This domestic leakage has spurred entrepreneurs to consider starting other ultra low-cost airlines in Canada, notorious for steep aviation operating costs and airfares. For WestJet, there’s another ancillary benefit: Revenue diversity, given that low oil prices have drained $1 billion (U.S.) ($1.3 billion Cdn.) in air travel spending from Alberta, where about 40 per cent of the carrier’s capacity flies. WestJet will move 10 of its 737-800s into the new, separate airline. With 189 seats, the planes will be the same as those flown by Ryanair Holdings Plc, which offers 30 inches of pitch between seats and no recline. WestJet flies that same model with only 168 seats today, including 12 “Plus” seats with extra legroom at the front of the cabin. The still-unnamed discount carrier’s first flights in leisure markets are expected late this year or in early 2018, WestJet executives said Tuesday on a quarterly call with analysts. Article Continued Below Of course, every successful player in this part of the airline business has begun with the same core element: costs that are materially lower than rivals who offer more amenities and far fewer fees. WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky said Tuesday that the new carrier “will have significantly lower cost on every line of that business” and will probably not fly “in markets where we have a nice business mix.” Yet some industry observers are deeply skeptical WestJet can succeed with an ultra low-cost offshoot, just as it’s ordering up to 20 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which will offer a new business-class service to Europe, Asia, and South America. Those planes, which begin to arrive in 2019, may replace older 767s WestJet flies to London and Hawaii. “Faced with startup discount airlines on one end and a saturated Canadian market on the other, management is fighting a two-front battle, with all of the cost and complexity that comes with it,” Walter Spracklin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a client note. WestJet’s new venture, and new 787s, come as the company’s 1,500 pilots are seeking to join the Air Line Pilots Association, which could lead to higher wages and other costs. The pilots rejected a similar unionization effort two years ago. Voting is scheduled for May 5 to 12. “If WestJet pilots do unionize, we would think it likely that the other employee groups (flight attendants, etc.) would follow suit,” Spracklin wrote April 20. WestJet appears to be following the approach some U.S. legacy airlines adopted with their “airline within an airline” forays, said Ben Baldanza, an adviser to NewLeaf Travel Co. The Manitoba-based company operates as a “virtual airline” by selling flights aboard Flair Airlines Ltd. As it approaches its first anniversary, NewLeaf is merging with Flair, which also flies oilfield workers and other charter customers. Continental Airlines began Continental Lite in 1993, while US Airways launched MetroJet a few years later. Delta Air Lines Inc. inaugurated a Boeing 757 fleet called Song to compete with JetBlue Airways Corp., and United Airlines started Ted, which flew Airbus A320s. None of the carriers flew for more than a few years before the parent company discontinued them, dissatisfied with financial results given that the startups’ costs were typically not much lower than those of their parents. “We’re not worried about WestJet at all because no airline-with-an-airline has ever worked,” said Baldanza, the former chief executive of Florida-based Spirit. “They’re just trying to scare competition out.” WestJet executives consider the new carrier “more of a separate vehicle” that won’t be integrated, at least initially, and will have a network that is co-ordinated with WestJet routes to avoid “cannibalization” of existing profits, said Bob Cummings, a WestJet executive vice president who will run the new airline. “We could see issues with their new ULCC cannibalizing yields of the mainline operator,” Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker wrote Tuesday in a client note titled “Too Much Going On to Get Comfortable.” Jim Scott, president and CEO of Vancouver-based Canada Jetlines Ltd., which hopes to begin flying as a ULCC next year, said WestJet’s effort won’t affect his startup because “the NewLeafs and the WestJets are just playing around the edges.” National Bank Financial cut its rating on WestJet shares May 2, to underperform, citing heightened “execution risks” in launching service at opposite ends of the customer spectrum. WestJet shares slid 3.2 per cent Tuesday, part of a 4.1 per cent decline this year. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to offer low fares,” Baldanza said in an interview. “The hard thing is how to make money with low fares.” Read more about: Westjet Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The space between the remaining rows will drop to 30 inches from 31 inches. American said it expects the new planes in the fall and that they will go into service later this year. “These (seats) are designed to be used in a very space-efficient way,” American spokesman Joshua Freed said. “Even though the pitch comes in at 29 (inches), the seats are built to maximise knee space and seat space.” The move to cram more passengers onto planes is likely to antagonise customers, already upset by costlier amenities and ageing infrastructure. At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, airline executives - including a representative for American - received scathing criticism about their customer service, after the furor surrounding a passenger being dragged from a full United Airlines plane to make room for airline employees. “Some don’t charge fees. Some do charge fees. Some charge fees for baggage. Some charge fees for oxygen. Who knows?” Representative Mike Capuano said at the tense hearing.

By KariPaul Reporter Some travelers in the U.S. are about to get even less comfortable in the skies. Seats on some American Airlines AAL, +0.11%  forthcoming Boeing BA, -0.03%  737 Max jetliners will now come with two inches less of legroom in coach, CNN reported this week. The “pitch,” or distance between the seats, was previously 31 inches and will now shrink to 29 in three rows of these airplanes. The rest of its main cabin will see the pitch decreased from 31 to 30. (American did not immediately respond to request for comment for this story). Traveling by air is getting increasingly uncomfortable for consumers: In 2016, airlines ranked seventh-to-last out of 43 industries in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Only one in four Americans say air travel is enjoyable and 27% say it’s “awful” according to a January CNBC survey — and the top complaint of air travelers? Uncomfortable seats. Some 77% of Americans say these are the most hated aspect of flying, compared with 71% who say delays are the worst part and 67% who say cancellations, the same study found. The change comes as major airlines make changes to compete with low-cost companies like Allegiant ALGT, +2.19% Frontier FRNT, +0.00% and Spirit SAVE, +0.39% Delta DAL, +1.00% American, and United Airlines UAL, +0.37%   have recently stripped down their cheapest ticket to “basic economy,” a tier of travel that charges passengers less but comes with fewer frills. Don’t miss: This might be the thing that finally convinces millennials to take cruises Mainly, these tickets do not allow passengers to bring more than one carry-on bag that fits under the seat in front of them and does not let them choose a seat when checking in, forcing them to board last and often placing them in the back of the plane or in middle seats. In January, American said it was adding basic economy class to compete with cheaper carriers. Even as airlines strip down the basic travel experience to consumers’ dismay, studies show Americans are unlikely to pay more for a better experience. Only 21% of Americans said they would pay for extra legroom on a flight less than three hours and 17% said they would pay for a wider seat a 2016 study from travel website Expedia found. Even less (7%) said they would pay for guaranteed space for a carry-on bag, the study showed. Travelers who value legroom may be better off picking airlines based on that factor alone. JBLU, -0.73%  as some of the most accommodating seats at 32 to 34 inches of legroom in its standard class. Other tips for securing a comfortable seat include speaking politely to airline staff or the gate agent to move you to an exit row before a flight or, if you can afford it, simply paying extra for first class.

By KariPaul Reporter Some travelers in the U.S. are about to get even less comfortable in the skies. Seats on some American Airlines AAL, +0.11%  forthcoming Boeing BA, -0.03%  737 Max jetliners will now come with two inches less of legroom in coach, CNN reported this week. The “pitch,” or distance between the seats, was previously 31 inches and will now shrink to 29 in three rows of these airplanes. The rest of its main cabin will see the pitch decreased from 31 to 30. (American did not immediately respond to request for comment for this story). Traveling by air is getting increasingly uncomfortable for consumers: In 2016, airlines ranked seventh-to-last out of 43 industries in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Only one in four Americans say air travel is enjoyable and 27% say it’s “awful” according to a January CNBC survey — and the top complaint of air travelers? Uncomfortable seats. Some 77% of Americans say these are the most hated aspect of flying, compared with 71% who say delays are the worst part and 67% who say cancellations, the same study found. The change comes as major airlines make changes to compete with low-cost companies like Allegiant ALGT, +2.19% Frontier FRNT, +0.00% and Spirit SAVE, +0.39% Delta DAL, +1.00% American, and United Airlines UAL, +0.37%   have recently stripped down their cheapest ticket to “basic economy,” a tier of travel that charges passengers less but comes with fewer frills. Don’t miss: This might be the thing that finally convinces millennials to take cruises Mainly, these tickets do not allow passengers to bring more than one carry-on bag that fits under the seat in front of them and does not let them choose a seat when checking in, forcing them to board last and often placing them in the back of the plane or in middle seats. In January, American said it was adding basic economy class to compete with cheaper carriers. Even as airlines strip down the basic travel experience to consumers’ dismay, studies show Americans are unlikely to pay more for a better experience. Only 21% of Americans said they would pay for extra legroom on a flight less than three hours and 17% said they would pay for a wider seat a 2016 study from travel website Expedia found. Even less (7%) said they would pay for guaranteed space for a carry-on bag, the study showed. Travelers who value legroom may be better off picking airlines based on that factor alone. JBLU, -0.73%  as some of the most accommodating seats at 32 to 34 inches of legroom in its standard class. Other tips for securing a comfortable seat include speaking politely to airline staff or the gate agent to move you to an exit row before a flight or, if you can afford it, simply paying extra for first class.

MUMBAI: Domestic full service airline Vistara is likely to place order for around 100 aircraft, including 50 wide-body planes by the end of the current quarter, according to an industry report. The Centre for Asia Pacific (CAPA), the Sydney-based aviation think-tank, in its report titled "Global Fleet and Financing Review 2017," also said that the airline is likely to opt for Boeing 777X for long haul operations. Vistara is a joint venture, in which Tata Sons owns 51 per cent stake and the rest is with Singapore Airlines. "Vistara is expected to be the next carrier to place a major order, of up to 100 aircraft before June, 2017, comprised of 50 narrow-bodies and 50 wide-bodies," CAPA said in its report today. This assumes significance in the backdrop of Vistara mulling launching international operations from mid 2018. The airline is expected to stick with Airbus for single-aisel equipment and is likely to opt for the 777X for long haul operations, the report said. When contacted, a Vistara spokesperson said that the airline does not comment on market speculations. "We don't comment on market speculations," the spokesperson said in response to a PTI query on the issue. The Delhi-based airline currently has 13 Airbus A320 aircraft in the fleet and it plans to take another seven (A320 Neo) planes by June 2018. The first of the seven A320 Neo planes is expected to be delivered to the airline this month. According to the report, the South Asia region is dominated by India, which accounts for 67 per cent of the total 742 aircraft in service. Also, India accounts for as much as 96 per cent of the 917 aircraft in the region, CAPA said adding India has one of the highest order book in service ratios in the world. Three of the eleven airlines -- Air India, IndiGo and Jet Airways - have a fleets of more than 100 aircraft. Gurgaon-based Budget carrier IndiGo alone has placed orders for 430 planes (in two separate orders of 180 and 250) with Airbus, a few of them have already been delivered to the carrier, while the other budget carrier GoAir has also placed orders for 144 planes with the European aviation major. Besides, Ajay Singh-promoted SpiceJet has also announced that it will purchase up to 205 new aircraft from Boeing with the order valued at Rs 1,50,000 crore.

(Photo via AP Images.) Modern aviation is a miracle. Unfortunately, it is a miracle accompanied by irritations small and large that have gradually built to something truly dreadful, like looking down to see every finger has several paper cuts and suddenly you’re being dunked in a vat of lemon juice that sears every one of them. Advertisement CNNMoney reports on the latest tiny maddening slice to your flesh: American Airlines (AAL) is planning to decrease the front-to-back space between some of its economy class seats by another two inches. The airline says it plans to add more seats on its coming Boeing (BA) 737 Max jetliners. To do that, it will shrink the distance between seats, also known as pitch, from 31 inches to 29 inches on three rows of the airplane, and down to 30-inches in the rest of its main economy cabin. The pub puts it into context: Advertisement With the change, American will become the first large U.S. carrier to offer legroom with a pitch that’s nearly on par with ultra-low cost carriers Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines. Those seats are an industry minimum 28-inches apart. By comparison, economy class pitch on Delta Air Lines(DAL) and United ranges between 30 and 31 inches, while JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Airlines (ALK) have between 31 and 33 inches. Skift explains that all over the industry, airlines are trying to cram more and more seats into planes—hence the shrinking legroom. Oh, and back to CNN Money: “United Airlines (UAL) is considering a similar move, according to a person briefed on its evaluations. United declined to comment.” Yeah, definitely seems like a good time for those guys to try something nobody will like. So happy for anybody with a fetish for being crammed into a tin can with the maximum possible number of strangers, though!

The carrier is now aiming to end losses by the end of next year, contingent on demand not deteriorating further, Chief Executive Officer Paul Gregorowitsch said in an interview on Tuesday. While the Mideast carrier will also delay plans to expand to a fleet of 70 aircraft and 75 destinations to 2023 from 2020, it still plans to order 15 new wide-body jets needed to replace older planes and add capacity, he said. Further discussions will be held with manufacturers and leasing firms next week as Oman Air seeks to agree terms to take either Airbus SE’s A350 or the Boeing Co. 787-9. The US model has a slight advantage because the carrier already operates six Dreamliners, with the tally set to increase to 10 in 2018. Oman Air will also go ahead with deliveries of the 20 Boeing 737 Max planes it has on order as it leases out some of its current narrow-body fleet to better match seats to demand. While the carrier is continuing to operate 10 Airbus A330s, which form the core of its wide-body operations, those planes will be retired to make way for the new aircraft. Gregorowitsch said the upgraded A330neo isn’t of interest. Aid ended While Oman Air remains unprofitable, the state-owned carrier is no longer getting government funding, having received $50 million last year and $300 million in 2014 when the CEO took over. The loss per passenger was cut by $10 last year and should decrease again in 2017, he said. Even with expansion more tentative, Oman Air has still added Nairobi and Manchester to its network this year, according to Gregorowitsch. Peshawar in Afghanistan could follow before the end of 2017, and addition next year include Hong Kong, Seoul and a city in South Africa, he said. More routes to mainland China are on hold after the company began flying to Guangzhou in 2016. It’s shelved plans for its own services to Turkey, relying instead on an agreement with Turkish Airlines. Oman Air’s German flights are now operated as code-shares with Deutsche Lufthansa AG and the European giant is among candidates for a joint-venture partnership, Gregorowitsch said.

The EPAWSS EW suite will replace the legacy TEWS system that has been fitted to F-15C (pictured) and F-15E-variant Eagles since the 1980s. (US Air Force) The programme prime, Boeing, completed its CDR of the system in February following a review of the CDR of the system's electronic warfare (EW) suite that was undertaken by sub-contractor BAE Systems in late 2016. EPAWSS is designed to sample the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, identify threats, prioritise, and allocate jamming resources against them, and will replace the 1980s-vintage Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite (TEWS) currently fitted to the USAF's more than 400 F-15C and F-15E-variant Eagles. Boeing was awarded a USD478.8 million contract for the engineering, manufacturing, and development (EMD) of EPAWSS in November 2016. With the CDR now passed, aircraft modification and flight testing will begin. As noted by BAE Systems, the programme is running about a month ahead of schedule. The system should be ready for operational fielding by 31 August 2020. Want to read more?

ROS LBoard 1 Pakatan Harapan invites public to submit logo design FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US MAS CEO: Debris on runway could have caused flat tyres Bernama | May 3, 2017 Peter Bellew says debris could have been on runway when aircraft took off in Jakarta or when it landed at KLIA. PUTRAJAYA: MAS chief executive officer Peter Bellew says the flat tyres on a MAS plane could have been caused by a piece of debris on the runway when the flight took off in Jakarta, Indonesia, or while landing at KLIA. “We are not sure but we are conducting a thorough investigation. “It is just like having a flat tyre but this tyre is very expensive. “It did some damage to the aircraft but there was no drama. “We apologise for the delay. Safety always comes first,” Bellew said. He was referring to two tyres of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH726 that deflated upon landing at the KL International Airport (KLIA) yesterday. Following the incident involving a Boeing 738 aircraft, KLIA’s runway 2 was closed indefinitely. Nobody was reported injured. Meanwhile, the transport ministry has directed the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to conduct a thorough investigation into the mishap. Its minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said the ministry viewed the incident seriously and an investigation was being conducted to determine its cause. “I have ordered DCA to submit a report on the investigation. We know the mishap should not have taken place. “It is a serious incident because it rarely takes place. We will investigate any incident, no matter how small. Wait for the report. “We will investigate from all angles, including the tyres used, the runway and whether it was very windy. “We will also check MAS’ maintenance records to get to the root of the incident.” He said DCA director-general Azharuddin Abdul Rahman would be involved in the investigation. Liow said this when he was met by reporters after an event at Bangunan Perdana Putra here today.

American Airlines (AAL) is planning to decrease the front-to-back space between some of its economy class seats by another two inches. The airline says it plans to add more seats on its coming Boeing (BA) 737 Max jetliners. To do that, it will shrink the distance between seats, also known as pitch, from 31 inches to 29 inches on three rows of the airplane, and down to 30-inches in the rest of its main economy cabin. American isn’t the only big airline heading in this direction. United Airlines (UAL) is considering a similar move, according to a person briefed on its evaluations. United declined to comment. The move signals a new step in the shrinking of U.S. airline cabins, and comes even as carriers are promising to improve overall customer service. With the change, American will become the first large U.S. carrier to offer legroom with a pitch that’s nearly on par with ultra-low cost carriers Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Frontier Airlines. Those seats are an industry minimum 28-inches apart. By comparison, economy class pitch on Delta Air Lines(DAL) and United ranges between 30 and 31 inches, while JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Airlines (ALK) have between 31 and 33 inches. The one advantage the big U.S. carriers still have over their lowest-fare rivals was a few more inches in economy. The bathrooms on American’s 737 Max jets will also be smaller, one person familiar with the planning said. The new Max jets will have more than 170 seats, two sources said, compared to 160 on its existing 737-800s. The airline said it is keeping its extra-legroom ‘Main Cabin Extra’ economy seats, as well as its 16 first class seats. These new single-aisle aircraft will go into use later this year and will primarily be flown on routes in North America. Fliers will still pay regular economy fares for the 18 seats with two inches less leg room. Two of those three rows of 29-inch pitch will be in the back of the plane and a third farther forward. These seats won’t be part of its new basic economy fares, which sell for less because fliers don’t get access to overhead bins, a seat assignment or frequent flier miles. An American spokesman said the airline will add 40 Max jets to its fleet by the end of 2019. It has 100 on order. The airline also said it might make similar changes to its existing fleet of 737-800s after the Max arrives, but no decisions have been made. The tighter legroom may mean that some corporate travel agents who avoid ultra-low cost airlines will balk at American, said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. As the big airlines match each other move for move, the risk is that 29 inches becomes the standard for flying economy in the United States. American has been a bellwether before for the airlines. For instance, it was the first big U.S. airline to introduce bag fees in 2008. Airlines have enjoyed strong profits and low fuel fuel prices after a decade of consolidation. They’re adding seats now to help offset rising employee wages. “This is one of the best economic environments the U.S. airline industry has seen in decades,” said Harteveldt. “There is no need to race to the bottom.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Navy Details Plan to Fix F/A-18 Oxygen Problem Mike Fabey May 3, 2017 TweetShareShare The Navy aviation community writ large is trying to get “crazy smart” about its own maintenance and testing procedures for the F-18, overcoming a sense of remote-control upkeep that has been associated with the Hornets and Super Hornets. U.S. Navy F/A-18 operators have enough of the hypoxia and other breathing-related problems that have seemingly plagued the aircraft over the past couple of years. One squadron, for example, has come up with a rather simple solution for a jet that gives its pilots such grief, “They put them on probation,” Capt. David Kindley, program manager for the Navy’s mainstay aircraft, told Scout Warrior in an interview.  “They put it in jail.” And to get out of jet jail, the aircraft must go through a pretty rigorous round of testing and vetting. “They are taking ownership of their own (hypoxia-related) issues),” Kindley says. “They are getting pretty smart on maintenance – crazy smart.” In the same way, the Navy aviation community writ large is trying to get “crazy smart” about its own maintenance and testing procedures for the aircraft, overcoming a sense of remote-control upkeep that has been associated with the Hornets and Super Hornets. “The thing about the F-18,” Kindley says, “is that they are so easy to maintain. It’s almost like we’ve taught our maintainers to think like they’re working on Xerox machine – you just open the door and unjam it.” That’s been the approach, until rather recently, about how the Navy would look at revamping the environmental control system (ECS) system and components that provide the breathable air pilots rely on in the cockpit. But now, Kindley, says, there’s a new mindset – and the aviation community is ready to overhaul the entire process, material set and general way of thinking, if necessary. The Navy needs to do this because it needs to keep the aircraft flying. Delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter deployments coupled with potential Super Hornet upgrades have made it possible – and in cases, necessary – for mixed-aircraft squadrons well into the coming decades. F-18 manufacturer Boeing has put together advanced Super Hornet systems and designs that give it greater stealth, range, communications and situational awareness – and Kindley says that for the most part the Navy is all aboard on the upgrades, especially because many of the components already exist within programs of record. But first, the Navy must work through its hypoxia-related issues with the aircraft, especially for legacy Hornets, the F/A-18 A-D models, whose Hypoxia-incident-related rate per 100,000 flight hours nearly doubled to 57.24 in fiscal 2015 from 30.20 the previous year. For EA-18G Growlers, the rate grew to 90.83 from 42.89 during that time. The Growlers have a specific problem – they operate generally higher altitudes and one of the air lines freezes up. Kindley says the Navy is looking at wrapping it in a blanket, writing new software or redesigning the system. The Navy needs to do a bit more engineering for the other aircraft.  First, the Navy is being less selective on the ECS components it’s going to review, starting with those on the older legacy Hornets. "A little over a year ago, we picked ECS components -- the big eight. But now, we’re beyond 30,” he added.  And the Navy has now started to look at, and replace components, before they broke. “We're not going to do fly to failure anymore. Now we have life limits on these components. That was a first step, and we’re beginning to see some benefits in the legacy world,” Kindley said.  That kind of work is also driving the Navy maintainers to question more what they do and why they do it. Kindley said “instead of waiting for something to fail, they are now asking deeper questions. How do you know a part is good? What makes it ready for re-use?” Some components, he noted, the same component several times. “We started to question acceptance-test procedures.” The Navy is even looking at the checklist used before a part is fixed. “Are you doing it right? Do you have the right tests? Are you doing the checklist correctly?” Kindley asked.  The Navy has done a bottoms-up review at places like Cherry Point where the components are repaired to make sure of the testing, repairing and training. “Are we even doing the right tests in the first place?” Kindley asks. “On one of our valves, the acceptance procedure was based on the voltage. But we never pushed air through it – that’s what the valve is for. This doesn’t make sense.” In some cases, he says, maintainers would follow every procedure to address certain issues, but nothing would work, dropping the jet into what the community called a “cul-de-sac,” and leaving it there. Now, he says, they want to provide every tool and resource to find out what’s really going on. It has come to a point though, the Navy is ready to replace every component, he says, “in one fell swoop.” When it comes to Super Hornets, Kindley said, the default answer to almost every breathing issue is “contamination.” The idea was, “If we’ve exhausted everything else, it must be contamination. But now we’re going to stop pushing the ‘easy button’ and figure out no-kidding what’s going on.” The Navy is outfitting its pilots with tubes – essentially sponges that will pick up all kinds of particles to be analyzed. The service also will put hydrocarbon detectors in the cockpit. Flyers also will get “slam sticks,” little orange matchbox-looking things, which records and time-stamps pressure swings. Combined with other sensors, the data, Kindley says, should provide a real snapshot of what’s happening and when. “It will show you where the spikes are, and give you a much better picture of what’s going on in the air,” he says. “This is going to be accelerated, pushed out to the squadron.” Pages 1 2 next › last » TweetShareShare Show full page View the discussion thread.

Source: Jamie Hunter The US Air Force (USAF) is considering an upgrade to the wheels and brakes of its Boeing B-52H Stratofortress bomber fleet following the loss of an aircraft during an aborted take-off on the island of Guam in 2016. A notice posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website on 2 May calls for information on improving the safety and reliability for the B-52H wheel and brake system. "This information will be used to support a USAF determination of whether or not to pursue a Wheel and Brake System Improvement (WBSI) programme," the notification said. This request for information (RFI) was posted days after the USAF completed its accident investigation into the loss of a B-52H that departed the runway at high-speed after aborting its take-off run at Andersen Air Force Base (AFB). The aircraft caught fire and sustained total damage with a loss valued at USD112 million. The accident on Guam that has led to this RFI occurred on 19 May 2016. At 08:32 hours (local time), a B-52H assigned to the 69th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, 5th Bomb Wing, Andersen AFB, Guam, departed the runway during a high-speed and heavy-weight aborted take-off during a routine training mission. The investigation into the incident noted that the aircraft's drag chute failed on deployment, which caused the wheel brakes to exceed their energy limits. The resulting heat ignited the aircraft, gutting it completely within minutes. There were no fatalities. Specific information requested by the USAF includes estimated maximum energy limits for that the upgraded wheels and brakes could absorb, as well as costs and spares supplies. According to the RFI, the USAF would look to retrofit the upgraded wheels and brakes across the 76 aircraft over a two year period. Want to read more?

The planes are outfitted as complete command centres for the President and his top officials including the Secretary of Defence and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the case of nuclear war or national emergency. The aeroplanes, while not technically secret, are rarely mentioned – the Air Force does not even publicly acknowledge owning some of them.

Unlike the ceremonial and comfort-focused Air Force One, the E-4B airborne command posts are flying war-rooms—staffed by dozens of military analysts, strategists and communication aides who would guide the President through the first days of a nuclear war. The planes also include special gear like a five-mile-long trailing wire antenna that would ensure that the president could remain in contact with the nuclear submarine fleet even after ground-based communications had been destroyed.

Yet even those Doomsday planes represent just one corner of the emergency air fleet at the president’s fingertips, all of which is easy to hide inside the large-scale logistics of a Presidential trip.

Over the years, as it sought to compete and grow, the frills, fares, and costs grew along with it. Now the Canadian-based carrier isn’t only headed back to its discount roots, it’s digging even deeper. The airline is planning to tackle the cheapest segment of the air-travel market by launching an ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) modeled on Ryanair. WestJet describes the move as defensive, intended to fend off incursions from rivals and helping stem the flow of some 5.5 million Canadian leisure travelers who cross the border to fly bargain airlines such as Allegiant Travel Co. and Spirit Airlines Inc. This domestic leakage has spurred entrepreneurs to consider starting other ultra-low-cost airlines in Canada, a nation notorious for steep aviation operating costs and airfares. For Calgary-based WestJet, there’s an additional ancillary benefit: revenue diversity, given that low oil prices have drained $1 billion in air travel spending from Alberta, where about 40 percent of the carrier’s capacity flies. WestJet will move 10 of its 737-800s into the new, separate airline. With 189 seats, the planes will be the same as those flown by Ryanair Holdings Plc, which offers 30 inches of pitch between seats and no recline. WestJet flies that same model with only 168 seats today, including 12 “Plus” seats with additional legroom at the front of the cabin. The still-unnamed discount carrier’s first flights in leisure markets are expected late this year or in early 2018, WestJet executives said on Tuesday during a quarterly call with analysts. Of course, every successful player in this part of the airline business has begun with the same core element: costs that are materially lower than those of rivals offering more amenities and far fewer fees. WestJet Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky said on Tuesday that the new carrier “will have significantly lower cost on every line of that business” and will probably not fly “in markets where we have a nice business mix.” “It’s the easiest thing in the world to offer low fares. The hard thing is how to make money with low fares.” Yet some industry observers are deeply skeptical WestJet can succeed with an ultra-low-cost offshoot, just as it’s ordering up to 20 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, which will offer a new business-class service to Europe, Asia, and South America. Those planes, which begin to arrive in 2019, may replace older 767s that WestJet flies to London and Hawaii. “Faced with startup discount airlines on one end and a saturated Canadian market on the other, management is fighting a two-front battle, with all of the cost and complexity that comes with it,” Walter Spracklin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, wrote in a client note. WestJet’s new venture, and its new 787s, come as the company’s 1,500 pilots are seeking to join the Air Line Pilots Association, which could lead to higher wages and other costs. The pilots rejected a similar unionization effort two years ago. Voting is scheduled for May 5-12. “If WestJet pilots do unionize, we would think it likely that the other employee groups (flight attendants, etc.) would follow suit,” Spracklin wrote on April 20. WestJet appears to be following the approach some U.S. legacy airlines adopted with their “airline within an airline” forays, said Ben Baldanza, an adviser to NewLeaf Travel Co. The Manitoba-based company operates as a “virtual airline” by selling flights aboard Flair Airlines Ltd. As it approaches its first anniversary, NewLeaf is merging with Flair, which also flies oilfield workers and other charter customers. The most important business stories of the day.

Delta Air Lines Inc. inaugurated a Boeing 757 fleet called Song to compete with JetBlue Airways Corp., and United Airlines started Ted, which flew Airbus A320s. None of the carriers flew for more than a few years before the parent company discontinued them, dissatisfied with financial results, given that the startups’ costs were typically not much lower than those of their parents. “We’re not worried about WestJet at all because no airline-with-an-airline has ever worked,” said Baldanza, the former chief executive of Florida-based Spirit. “They’re just trying to scare competition out.” WestJet executives consider the new carrier “more of a separate vehicle” that won’t be integrated, at least initially, and will have a network that is coordinated with WestJet routes to avoid “cannibalization” of existing profits, said Bob Cummings, a WestJet executive vice president who will run the new airline. “We could see issues with their new ULCC cannibalizing yields of the mainline operator,” Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker wrote on Tuesday in a client note titled “Too Much Going On to Get Comfortable.” Jim Scott, president and CEO of Vancouver-based Canada Jetlines Ltd., which hopes to begin flying as a ULCC next year, said WestJet’s effort won’t affect his startup because “the NewLeafs and the WestJets are are just playing around the edges.” National Bank Financial cut its rating on WestJet shares on May 2 to underperform, citing heightened “execution risks” in launching service at opposite ends of the customer spectrum. WestJet shares slid 3.2 percent on Tuesday, part of a 4.1 percent decline this year. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to offer low fares,” Baldanza said in an interview. “The hard thing is how to make money with low fares.” —With Frederic Tomesco in Montreal Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Tony Capaccio US President Donald Trump vows to block Kim Jong Un’s regime from developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the US. Photo: Reuters Washington: The Pentagon will attempt a new test by the end of this month of whether it can intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile like the ones North Korea is seeking to develop, according to the deputy director of the US Missile Defence Agency. “It’s coming up later this month,” Rear Admiral Jon Hill said in remarks on Tuesday at a “Missile Defence Day” gathering on Capitol Hill that had marketing displays by top contractors including Boeing Co., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. Hill said the test has “been planned for a while” and wasn’t intended as a provocation to North Korea or any other nation. Asked after his remarks about the timing, Hill described 1 June as an approximate window for the test. The attempt to intercept a dummy target will take on symbolic importance whether it succeeds or fails, as North Korea ramps up its ballistic missile development and President Donald Trump vows to block Kim Jong Un’s regime from developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the US. The next interception attempt will be the first since a successful test in June 2014. But before that, two tests failed in 2010. The Missile Defense Agency has said its extensive efforts to fix flaws with the interceptor’s warhead have paid off. But the Pentagon’s weapons testing office has said the $36 billion system of ground-based interceptors can’t yet be counted on to shoot down a nuclear-armed missile aimed at the US West Coast by North Korea or Iran. The network of radar and communications—combined with missiles based in California and Alaska— has demonstrated only a “limited capability to defend the US homeland from small numbers of simple” intercontinental ballistic missiles, the testing office said in its latest annual report. ‘Increased tensions’ Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said the next test “takes on special significance because of the increased tensions in the world.” “Rather than being provocative, I see this as a move toward stability,” Franks said in an interview. “If an enemy recognizes we can knock down the first one or the second one or maybe the fourth or fifth one, they know that’s going to give us the time for an offensive response—and that is a deterrent in itself.” The US test will attempt to shoot down a target that replicates for the first time the speed, trajectory and closing velocity of an ICBM. The US also will test avionics updates to the booster rocket built by Orbital ATK Inc., which carries an improved version of a hit-to-kill conventional warhead made by Raytheon, Missile Defense Agency officials have said. Boeing manages the missile defence system. Asked the implication if the test shot fails, Franks, a supporter of the missile defence system, said “it definitely has significance.” But “if you ask Kim Jong Un, you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes.” Bloomberg Tony Capaccio Topics: North Korea US missile defence Missile test Pentagon Ballistic missile More From Livemint READ MORE FBI director James Comey ‘nauseous’at thought he swayed US election India faces piquant situation at WTO In search of a ‘Dharna Chowk’ in Hyderabad First Published: Wed, May 03 2017. 12 18 PM IST Editor's Picks The fault in IPL match schedules Cabinet clears ordinance to tackle Rs9.64 trillion bad loans at India’s banks Why India should tax agricultural income Latest News FBI director James Comey ‘nauseous’at thought he swayed US election India faces piquant situation at WTO In search of a ‘Dharna Chowk’ in Hyderabad IPL 2017: Rahul Tripathi fires Supergiants to 4-wicket win over Knight Riders Global gold prices rise, but hold near six-week low on Fed rate hike worries Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

Russia is forging a new era in space. Ever since the United States retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station (ISS) in Russian Soyuz spaceships -- paying Russian space agency Roscosmos for the privilege. The plan is for NASA to soon switch over sometime soon to using its own rockets -- built by SpaceX and  Boeing   (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture -- but it remains an open question when these companies will have their spacecraft ready for use. In the meantime, American astronauts must continue to fork over $82 million a seat in payment for rides aboard Soyuz. And what is Russia doing with all that money, you ask? It's using it to develop a new spaceship of its own -- a very interesting spaceship. Going where no cosmonaut has gone before -- on Russia's Federatsiya Roscosmos is currently developing a new and improved spacecraft -- one capable not just of ferrying supplies and astronauts to ISS, but also of fulfilling Russia's dream of one day landing a cosmonaut on the moon, or even Mars.  In a move evocative of both Star Trek and Russia's own official name -- "the Russian Federation" -- it's calling the new spacecraft Federatsiya, or "Federation." (Side note: The current Soyuz spacecraft design was named for the Soviet Union, or Sovyetsky Soyuz). Now here's what we know about the spaceship that will replace the Soyuz. Energia, a publicly traded Russian "rocket and space public corporation," has been working on developing the Federatsiya for more than a decade. According to new reports, completing the effort will require another five years and cost a further $734 million. In a break from tradition, the Soyuz rocket-Soyuz capsule combination of current spaceships will be replaced by the Federatsiya capsule being carried atop a new heavy-lift rocket called Angara. Another change -- instead of launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Angara and Federatsiya will launch out of Roscosmos's new seven-launchpad spaceport in Russia's Amur Oblast, dubbed the "Vostochny Cosmodrome" (the "Eastern Spaceport"). The new Federatsiya capsule will stand 20 feet tall and weigh 14.4 metric tons. Larger than its predecessor Soyuz, Federatsiya will accommodate between four and six cosmonauts. Plans are for Federatsiya to make its first trip to space in 2021, unmanned. Crewed missions are expected to begin as early as 2023, and Russia plans to conduct a manned moon mission with Federatsiya as early as 2025.  No crew, but... Now here's where this story gets weird. Federatsiya's first trip to space in 2021 may be unmanned, but Russia's new spaceship won't be going into space entirely uncrewed. To the contrary, the spacecraft will carry a pilot -- a robot pilot. According to Russian news agency TASS, Russia plans to crew Federatsiya's first mission with a humanoid robot named FEDOR (short for "Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research") at the helm. FEDOR will be the sole passenger aboard Federatsiya's maiden flight. TASS reports that FEDOR is capable of screwing in a light bulb, unlocking and opening a door, and driving a car -- and apparently, a spacecraft, too. Developed by Russia's Android Technics Research and Production Association under contract to the country's Emergencies Ministry, FEDOR was designed to perform work "in extreme conditions." To accomplish its missions, FEDOR has been equipped with both "fine motor skills and decision-making algorithms." Russia plans to test that thesis by giving FEDOR control over Federatsiya. What comes next? That's already pretty amazing. Not only is Russia developing a new spaceship, but it's developing an entirely new way to crew spaceships, too. What could be even more interesting is what Russia plans to do next. For example, FEDOR doesn't need to breathe, and he won't require a spacesuit -- so might Russia also decide to send FEDOR out through the hatch on an extra-vehicular activity mission? A few years from now, could we see FEDOR, or multiple FEDORs, land on and explore the moon itself, no cosmonauts required? The upshot of all this, of course, is that Russia appears set on blazing new trails in space -- even as NASA under the Trump administration endures small but significant budget cuts. Adding insult to injury, Russia is doing all this on our dime -- and will continue to do so until SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed get their act together and begin launching their space shuttle replacements. Only then will NASA be able to stop paying Roscosmos for astronaut rides and begin spending that money on developing our own space program again.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

The Airplane left Tehran’s International Imam Khomeini Airport at 7:30 local time for Stockholm, Sweden, reported Irna, the official Iranian news agency. Following the implementation of Iran nuclear deal – known as JCPOA – and the removal of arbitrary sanctions on Tehran, Iran Air began renovating its fleet signing contracts for purchase of 200 modern airplanes from Boeing, Airbus and ATR. Three of the purchased planes from the French aircraft manufacturer have been delivered to Iran Air so far, two of which are Airbus 330 and the other one is Airbus 321 with 190 seats and is being used in domestic lines. Boeing is also due to deliver the first aircraft to the Iranian national carrier in 2018, the report said, noting that four of the planes purchased from ATR are scheduled to arrive in the country within the next few days.   Tags: Iran Air | Airbus A330 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories More options this summer with flydubai’s growing network Qatar Airways named official airline partner of electric street racing series AirBaltic appoints new PR head Bahrain showcases local craftsmanship at Tunisian handicrafts events Etihad boosts capacity to Kerala City Seasons Group of Hotels welcomes new group sales head Mercure Grand Hotel Doha City Centre welcomes new GM Incredible India eyes ME tourists UAE, Saudi Arabia top destinations for UK travellers Middle East freight demand up 16.3pc in March Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham JBR welcomes new team members Jazeera tops ‘On-Time Performance' list for ME UAE ranked 2nd most popular destination for Muslim travellers New Universal Orlando hotel to open in 2018 summer New water theme park set to open in US this month Thailand’s Muslim-friendly travel app now in Arabic Asaas to build key facility at Muscat airport Bahrain Duty Free unveils new Dolce&Gabbana fragrances counter Mövenpick Jumeirah Beach makes new appointments Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel appoints new executive chef Dubai Health inks MoU to drive wellness tourism New sales head for Mangalis Hotel Group Bahrain launches new ‘Domestic Tourism Survey’ Qatar Airways offers free Doha stopover to transit passengers Dubai Gourmet to launch boutique hotel Hilton, KFCD partner for $66m hotel in Bahrain Gulf Air renews IOSA certification Alpha Destination eyes new overseas markets Thailand hosts biggest Destination Wedding Planners Congress Jannah to build tallest luxury tower in Sharjah Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The sponsorship promises to deliver premier fan experiences, community engagement and unique online content.  With over 140 million loyal MNT fans living in Mexico and the United States, MNT plays an important role in the Hispanic culture and provides a natural platform to celebrate the start of the joint co-operation agreement between Delta and Aeromexico once the JCA becomes effective. Delta and Aeromexico will serve not only as the team's official airlines, but the global sponsorship will include an array of promotional assets around all games in Mexico, Mexico hosted games in the U.S. as part of the annual MNT U.S. Tour, and at World Cup qualifiers and international exhibitions played in both countries.

"For Aeromexico, as the flag carrier of Mexico, it is a pleasure to be part of this sports deal. This sponsorship reflects the importance of the Mexican National Team for the country and our upcoming partnership with Delta. We are excited to launch this new sponsorship and look forward to the benefits it will bring to our customers and employees," said Anko van der Werff, Chief Revenue Officer at Aeromexico.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons. A divestment resolution’s failure to be passed by the George Washington (GW) University student government on Monday by the slimmest of margins has pro-Israel activists on campus breathing a sigh of relief. GW student Jake Barnette — an Emerson Fellow for the educational group StandWithUs (SWU) — told The Algemeiner he was “very thankful that this bill was defeated,” but added, “the small margin of this vote means that our campus needs to be more united and work together.” The motion — titled “The Palestinian Human Rights Act” and demanding the GW endowment divest from ten companies that supposedly profit from Palestinian suffering — was promoted by GW’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and included a month-long campaigning effort under the banner, “Divest This Time at GW.” Related coverage May 3, 2017 4:51 pm 0 At White House Meeting with Trump, Palestinian Leader Signals Abandonment of Unilateral Statehood Recognition Strategy Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas offered a strong signal on Wednesday that he would abandon the strategy he pursued in recent... The final vote tally — after a marathon four hours of debate — was 14 in favor, 15 against, and one abstention. Ben Brownstein — SWU’s mid-Atlantic campus director — said in a statement Tuesday, “I’m glad that enough students saw through the propaganda and took a principled stand.” “Anti-Israel activists relied on misleading claims and manipulative rhetoric, hoping that emotional appeals would cloud the judgement of the Student Association,” he added. According to SWU, the motion “relied heavily on the infamous and widely discredited Goldstone Report,” the 2011 document produced from a United Nations fact-finding mission into Israel’s military conduct during Operation Cast Lead (the IDF’s December 2008-January 2009 campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip). Richard Goldstone, the report’s eponymous author, later retracted his accusations of Israeli war crimes. SJP maintained that the resolution was disconnected from the worldwide boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement to isolate and delegitimize Israel, and was only focused on the ten corporations named, according to campus paper The GW Hatchet. (Those included Caterpillar, Boeing, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin and Motorola Solutions, which SJP said have manufactured goods and weaponry sold to Israel and used against Palestinians.) However, the GW divestment campaign included a launch event featuring renowned BDS activist Angela Davis, and celebrations of the successes of BDS resolutions at other campuses, including one in April at Tufts University. SJP also explicitly referenced BDS in its statement on the motion’s outcome, posted on Facebook, in which it described the movement a “call from Palestinian civil society…[to] people of conscience.” Gilad Skolnick — the director of campus programming at the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) on Campus — told The Algemeiner, “As proven time and time again, the BDS initiative is an antisemitic campaign targeting only the Jewish state. The claim that this particular resolution is not part of this broader campaign is either due to ignorance or a deliberate and deceitful move on the part of the students penning the resolution with the aim of misleading their peers.” GW student Noa Levin — a former CAMERA fellow — said she thought BDS would “continue to be an issue on campus, because it’s under the umbrella of liberal causes that people — without prior knowledge of the conflict — just accept.” The GW result followed a failed attempt to pass pro-BDS resolution at Montclair State University late last month. That motion was widely rejected by the student senate, with 11 votes against, one in favor and six abstentions. Share this Story: Let your voice be heard! Join the Algemeiner Close Be in the know!

The US military is deploying a tool to do just that. “If we can shut down or deny their communication, then we are causing chaos,” Lt. Col. Chris Weaton of the Electronic Combat Squadron said on Wednesday. The weapon of choice to conduct these operations is the Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call, a 97-foot aircraft designed for electronic warfare.  The EC-130H can effectively prevent enemy forces from coordinating their positions on the battlefield, Weaton noted. Meanwhile, US-led coalition troops can use that opportunity “to organize and act” against Daesh “in a way that takes advantage of their confusion,” the Air Force officer said.  © REUTERS/ Northrop Grumman Corp/Handout US, NATO Preparing Unmanned Sixth Generation Fighter Jet Armed With Lasers In all outward appearances, the aircraft looks similar to other planes flying in the USAF,  but inside it is totally different, outfitted with a number of computers and technological systems that track Daesh communication centers and block them, Stars and Stripes explained. Northrop Grumman-made EA-6B Prowlers and Boeing EA-18G Growlers round out the electronic warfare aerial fleet.  The crew of the Compass Call “provides an organic capability to both identify what the threats are and then also target those threats,” Weaton remarked, adding, “other types of platforms don’t necessarily have that dual capability within them.”  The enemy, however, is constantly reinventing how it communicates, which constitutes the biggest obstacle to jamming them. “Anytime they develop new capability and new technology, they use that and then we have to come up with a way to counter that,” he said, noting it is a “big challenge.” ...

In the late 1990s, the Defense Department decided against downselecting to one vendor for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, opting instead to back Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s competing Delta IV and Atlas V rockets, respectively, to lower costs ...

By Franz-Stefan Gady for The Diplomat May 04, 2017               Japan’s fleet of 13 license-built AH-64DJP Apache attack helicopters will be retrofitted with new sensors to improve the vision of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force’s (JGSDF) deadliest helicopter gunship. According to an April 26 press release, the U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin has been awarded a contract to upgrade the so-called Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M‑TADS/PNVS) system of the AH-64DJP — the “eyes” of the helicopter that provides pilots with long-range, precision engagement, and pilotage capabilities for safe flight during day, night, and adverse weather missions. “Under the M-TADS/PNVS contract, Lockheed Martin will deliver 14 laser designation kits through 2020 to upgrade Japan Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) M-TADS systems,” the statement reads. “The Modernized Day Sensor Assembly (M-DSA) upgrade improves laser reliability and the Apache’s ability to designate targets and establish accurate target range. The company’s Apache sustainment team will also provide PBL support under a separate three-year contract.”Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. According to a company representative, “Lockheed Martin’s M-DSA laser designator significantly enhances the capabilities of Japan’s Apache fleet. Modernizing the M-TADS system delivers improved weapon effectiveness to JGSDF aircrews and streamlined sustainment support to maintainers.” Japan is the first international customer to receive an M-DSA field upgrade. The AH-64D is one of the world’s most advanced attack helicopters currently in service. Armed with laser-guided precision Hellfire missiles, Stinger air-to-air missiles, 70 millimeter rockets, and a 30 mm automatic cannon, the helicopter would primarily be deployed to destroy enemy tank forces in the event of conflict. Japan selected Fuji Heavy Industries (FHI) in 2002 to license-build a local variant of the Boeing AH-64D attack helicopter. Japan initially intended to build up to 80 helicopters. Due to budget constraints, the number was later on reduced to 60 and in 2007 dropped to a mere 13 airframes. As of 2017, the JGSDF operates one squadron of ten AH-64DJPs with the remaining three helicopters assigned to training units. Japan does not intend to procure additional AH-64Ds in the immediate future. As I reported in December 2016, Japan’s fiscal year 2017 defense budget request called for the procurement of six additional F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, four Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft (a hybrid between a conventional helicopter and turboprop plane), 11 AAV7 amphibious assault vehicles, and an additional Soryu-class diesel-electric attack submarine, among a host of other equipment. Once funds for new military hardware have been allocated in the annual military budget it takes two to five years until it reaches the respective service –a slight improvement to earlier procurement cycles. Japan in part decided to cancel the additional AH-64Ds in 2007 because it would have taken around 20 years to complete the planned purchase of 60 helicopter gunships.

(Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) Longstanding economic differences keep unemployment higher in Pierce County. But could Tacoma eventually benefit from Seattle's affordability issues? Share story By Jon Talton Special to The Seattle Times The March unemployment rate for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area was 3.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent a year earlier, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. But a deeper look shows that not every part of the region is rising equally. The Census Bureau breaks Seattle and Tacoma into separate metropolitan divisions, too. Thus, the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett metropolitan division’s jobless rate was 3.2 percent. Yet the rate for Tacoma-Lakewood was 5.8 percent. The state stood at 4.9 percent and the national rate was 4.6 percent, not seasonally adjusted. This continues a long historical pattern. Going back to the late 1980s, when data began being compiled on a systematic basis, Pierce County’s unemployment was always higher than in Seattle’s King County. At the peak of the Great Recession, it was 11.9 percent vs. King County’s 9.5 percent. The reasons are complicated. Pierce County was historically abandoned by some of its most important headquarters, notably Weyerhaeuser. Its economy remained tied to a shrinking industrial base while King County vaulted in the Microsoft and Amazon eras. The Seattle-Bellevue-Everett metro division also benefits from having the most Boeing workers. The City of Destiny won the first transcontinental railroad terminal in the 19th century, but Seattle was more on the make to become a business capital.

Light up the ‘peace joint’  WATCHUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Tacoma is more affordable. Unfortunately, it’s too far away to play Oakland to Seattle’s San Francisco, and the means to bring large numbers of Pierce County residents to King County employment centers (more commuter rail, light rail) don’t yet exist. It’s even possible that Tacoma could benefit from businesses fleeing “socialist” Seattle or startups looking for cheaper digs. But this would be a long process. Pierce County and Tacoma remain an important part of the Puget Sound economy, especially with the Port of Tacoma. It has gained some wins since the downturn, such as a State Farm regional center. But they will also continue to play catch-up to the larger city to the north (unless Seattle gets the biblical comeuppance for which so many seem to hope — but Tacoma is closer to our pet live volcano).

Prior to this year's competition, EY has been among the Top 10 for the past eight years "Like the other companies high on the DiversityInc Top 50, EY understands diversity and inclusion is critical to business and rooted in finding the best talent," said DiversityInc CEO Luke Visconti. "EY is number one because the company worked harder than all others and has deep CEO engagement with Steve Howe, who has empowered his people to do their job, and they did it." The DiversityInc Top 50 list, issued yearly since 2001, recognizes the nation's top companies for diversity and inclusion management. These companies excel in such areas as hiring, retaining and promoting women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBT and veterans. In addition to its position on the Top 50, EY also landed on nine specialty lists, including No.1 for Executive Women, People with Disabilities, Diversity Councils, Employee Resource Groups and Mentoring. DiversityInc's extensive annual survey yields an empirically driven ranking based on recruitment, talent development, senior leadership commitment and supplier diversity. This year's competition was improved by new survey questions, increased emphasis on fairness over chasing numbers and more sophisticated analysis from DiversityInc data scientists.

American Airlines (AAL) is planning to decrease the front-to-back space between some of its economy class seats by another two inches. The airline says it plans to add more seats on its coming Boeing (BA) 737 Max jetliners. To do that, it will shrink the distance between seats, also known as pitch, from 31 inches to 29 inches on three rows of the airplane, and down to 30-inches in the rest of its main economy cabin. American isn’t the only big airline heading in this direction. Read the full story › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTERS Sponsored By FacebookTwitterTuneIn Home Blogs Nathan Sybil Tanner Playlist Contests Photos Events Video Mark Cuban Is Buying Twitter May 3, 2017 11:02 AM Filed Under: AI, Artificial Intelligence, Dallas, Mark Cuban, Market Watch, Social Media, stocks, tech, technology, Twitter (Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York) So he’s not buying the whole company, but he is buying shares. “A couple million” to be exact. Mark Cuban announced recently he is buying “a couple million” shares of Twitter because of the company’s possible artificial intelligence capabilities. In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Alley, Cuban told the reporter, “I started buying Twitter just recently because I think they finally got their act together with artificial intelligence.” Twitter isn’t the only company showing off interest in pursuing AI. The company joins the AI bubble along with the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Boeing Co., and Tesla. Following a huge revenue miss for Twitter in February, CEO Jack Dorsey insisted not all is lost. He announced Twitter just acquired Magic Pony Technology, a London-based technology company that has developed novel machine learning techniques for visual processing. What does it all mean? Machine learning will help the company understand how to better enhance your user experience with Twitter. Sounds cool. After Cuban announced his investment, shares of Twitter soared by roughly 5% as of 1:15 p.m. ET to $18.42. You can see the visual here. Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 03, 2017 11:44am   Comments Share: Related XLI Best Sector ETFs For April: No Fooling Around Aecom, PulteGroup And ETFs: Fast Money Picks For March 10 Direxion, one of the largest issuers of inverse and leveraged exchange traded funds, significantly increased its stable of such ETFs Wednesday with the debut of five new products. Several of Direxion's new leveraged ETFs are plays on sectors and industries believed to be beneficiaries of various political efforts by the Trump Administration. “With the new administration in Washington comes new policies that have the potential to affect the capital markets landscape,” said Sylvia Jablonski, Managing Director at Direxion. “We aim to provide traders with ways to capitalize on opportunities created by those new policies.”  A Defense Play  On the back of President Trump's promise to bolster defense spending and the looming possibility of several geopolitical conflicts around the globe, aerospace and defense stocks and ETFs have been stellar performers since election day. That could be a sign the Direxion Daily Aerospace & Defense 3X Shares (NYSE: DFEN) is a well-timed addition to the Direxion lineup. DFEN will attempt to deliver triple the daily returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index, which attempts to measure the performance of the aerospace and defense industry of the U.S. equity market. Top holdings in the index include Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) (9.5 percent), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) (9.07 percent), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) (7.61 percent), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: GD) (6.93 percent) Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) (6.21 percent), and Northrup Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) (6.07 percent). It also includes small exposures to the firearms and shipbuilding industries.  Adding To The Broad Sector ETFs Direxion also introduced several broad sector and industry-related funds.  The Direxion Daily Industrials Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: DUSL). DUSL will attempt to deliver triple the daily returns of the widely followed Industrials Select Sector Index, which allocatesa healthy percentage of its weightto aerospace and defense stocks.  Top holdings in this index include General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) (8.66 percent), 3M CO (NYSE: MMM) (5.51 percent), Boeing (5.01 percent), Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: HON) (4.88 percent), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) (4.58 percent). The other new broad sector play could be a play for traders willing to bet no more interest rates hikes are coming, at least not for a while. The Direxion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: UTSL) will look to deliver triple the daily returns of the Utilities Select Sector Index, whose biggest holdings include NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE: NEE) (9.62 percent), Duke Energy Corp (NYSE: DUK) (8.21 percent), Southern Co (NYSE: SC) (7.61 percent), Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE: D) (7.5 percent), and PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) (5.24 percent).  UTSL is a more levered, bull counterpart to the Direxion Daily Utilities Bear 1x Shares (NYSE: UTLZ), which Direxion launched earlier this year.  Keeping with the industrial theme, Direxion also introduced theDirexion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TPOR). The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares will seek triple the daily returns of the famous Dow Jones Transportation Average. Top holdings in the index include FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) (12.64 percent), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE: NSC) (7.87 percent), Union Pacific (7.5 percent), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) class B shares (7.16 percent), and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU) (6.01 percent).  Will There Be A Border Wall? Depending on the answer to that question, there's the new Direxion Daily MSCI Mexico Bull 3X Shares(NYSE: MEXX), which will seek triple the daily returns of the MSCI Mexico IMI 25/50 Index. MEXX is Direxion's third triple-leveraged bullish Latin America ETF, and includes exposure to the country's telecom, consumer banking, and beverage industries.  How To Use These ETFs It should be noted that all of these funds include the word "daily" in their name. They're meant to deliver returns over the course of a given day, and not over a time horizon any longer than that. All leveraged ETFs make use of swaps and derivatives to accomplish their stated objective, making them harmful to be held over the long term.  Image credit: Wikimedia Commons Posted-In: Long Ideas News Sector ETFs Short Ideas Emerging Markets Specialty ETFs New ETFs Emerging Market ETFs Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Pearlman, collectSPACE.com Editor | May 3, 2017 10:31am ET MORE The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, operated by Delaware North, is seen from the air in October 2016. Credit: Cory Huston/NASA NASA has awarded an early extension to its concessionaire, Delaware North, to continue operating Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, the public face to the Florida spaceport. The extension comes as the Visitor Complex is about to mark its 50th anniversary, having first opened in August 1967. Delaware North, a hospitality and food services company, has operated the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex since 1995. In 2010, NASA chose to continue working with the concessionaire through a competitive bid process on a 10-year base period with options for another 10 years. The early extension will see Delaware North continuing to run the NASA visitor complex through 2028. [Photos: NASA's Space Shuttle Atlantis on Display at KSC] "On behalf of Delaware North ... I want to thank NASA for giving us the opportunity to continue the work that we have done together to make the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex an absolute must-see experience for all," Scott Socha, the president of Delaware North parks and resorts division, said in a statement. Since 2012, Delaware North has worked with NASA to add new space center tours and educational programs, as well as increased visitor opportunities to see NASA and private launches from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The company has also overseen the design and construction of new attractions, including the $100 million Space Shuttle Atlantis exhibit showcasing the retired iconic NASA orbiter, and Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, highlighting NASA's early space explorers. Guests view the space shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida. Credit: Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex The early extension comes after the visitor complex set an annual attendance record in 2016 — 1.66 million people — surpassing the previous high record set in 2009, the next-to-last full year of the space shuttle program. Recently, Delaware North has focused on adding exhibits to highlight current and near-future NASA programs and the initiatives of NASA's commercial spaceflight partners. For example, visitors can learn about current missions to the International Space Station and upcoming missions to explore deep space, including missions to the Red Planet, in "Journey to Mars: Explorers Wanted." And just last month, the complex's "NASA Now" exhibition welcomed NASA's Orion Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1) spacecraft, which was launched in 2014 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy rocket into high Earth orbit. "Everyone with Delaware North is thrilled this extension will allow us to continue the momentum in enhancing the visitor complex over the next decade," said Therrin Protze, chief operating officer of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. "We have an incredible story to tell to millions of people about NASA's current and future space programs, as well as what SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the other private space companies are doing." The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex is funded by sales from admission, food and beverages, as well as from retail and education programs, with no use of tax dollars. A portion of the funds is invested to add and enhance to the attractions and to maintain and preserve the hundreds of artifacts that are on exhibit at the complex, including the space shuttle Atlantis, spacecraft from the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, and rockets, including the only remaining Saturn IB and one of three remaining Saturn V boosters. In addition to operating the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Delaware North also runs the concession sales for several National Parks, including Sequoia and Kings in California, Shenandoah in Virginia and the Grand Canyon in Arizona.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print House to take up spending deal as Trump threatens a fall shutdown By Gregory Hellman 05/03/17 10:00 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien and Jacqueline Klimas DRIVING THE DAY — HOUSE MOVES THE OMNIBUS: The House takes up the bipartisan spending package finally forged Sunday night, including a $15 billion boost in defense spending. Story Continued Below — AND TRUMP SAYS GIVE ME A 'GOOD SHUTDOWN' ... IN OCTOBER? writes The Washington Post: “President Trump on Tuesday called for a government shutdown later this year and suggested the Senate might need to prohibit future filibusters, dramatic declarations from a new commander in chief whose frustration is snowballing as Congress continues to block key parts of his agenda. “‘Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!’ Trump wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday morning. He likely meant a shutdown in October, as the current spending bill lawmakers have agreed to would fund government operations through Sept. 30. “Trump’s call for a shutdown, which appears to be unprecedented from a sitting president, comes as his problems are mounting within the House and Senate, chambers that are both controlled by his party.” Asked about Trump's comments, House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry subtly disagreed. "It would be better for the country if the Pentagon and the military do not shut down at any point because the threats to the country do not shut down," the Texas Republican said Tuesday. "My impression is the president is frustrated with the legislative process, especially in the other body, and I share that frustration for sure." Trump tries to claim a border wall win in the new budget deal, reports POLITICO’s Louis Nelson. And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly says he’s “shocked” that some politicians are celebrating the lack of border wall funding in the compromise budget deal, via our colleague Aidan Quigley. — GRAHAM IS FURIOUS, BUT WON’T FORCE A SHUTDOWN NOW, writes POLITICO’s Burgess Everett: “Sen. Lindsey Graham is mad as hell about the spending deal struck by congressional leaders. “And while he initially said in an interview that he was willing to hold up the government funding bill past the Friday deadline to be heard, he later told reporters he planned to vote against the bill but would not stop it from advancing and would not cause a government shutdown.” — MATTIS BACKS DEFENSE BOOST: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was “pleased” with the increase in defense spending in the budget deal. “As I said upon assuming this office, every action we take will be designed to ensure our military is ready to fight today and in the future,” he said in a statement. “This budget agreement helps us do just that.” TRUMP’S SECOND PICK FOR ARMY SECRETARY COULD WITHDRAW, reports CNN: “The nomination of President Donald Trump's Army secretary is in serious jeopardy, and he could be withdrawing as soon as this week, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. “Mark Green, Trump's second pick to be Army secretary, is facing what the sources described as a difficult — if not insurmountable — path to confirmation amid a backlash over his controversial statements on LGBT issues, Islam and evolution. “The sources said that Green's withdrawal is not finalized, but it's unlikely he would go forward because "there are questions whether he has enough support from either side of the aisle" to get confirmed, according to one source.” — AND TRUMP’S AIR FORCE NOMINEE IS ON HOLD, reports our colleague Connor O’Brien: “An unidentified Democratic senator has placed a procedural hold on President Donald Trump's nominee to be Air Force secretary, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said today. “The hold will have to resolved before the full Senate votes to confirm former Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) but McCain said he's "optimistic" the issue can be worked out. "’There's one hang-up right now, one of the Democrats,’ McCain said. ‘We're trying to work it out.’” IT’S WEDNESDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

And while there, Abbas is expected to ask Trump to back an Arab peace plan offering Israel normalization with the Arab and Muslim world if it allows a Palestinian state along the 1967 lines, writes The Associated Press.

Learn more at HuntingtonIngalls.com ** FOR YOUR RADAR — DRAFT ACQUISITION REFORM PROPOSAL COMING THIS MONTH, via Connor: “A draft acquisition reform proposal will likely be released in mid-May, House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry said Tuesday. “Speaking to reporters, the Texas Republican said he intends to make the so-called discussion draft public the week of May 15, following a recess. "’My intention is to introduce a standalone bill again that week,’ Thornberry said. ‘So, it will be out there for a month or a little longer in order to have feedback from anybody who wants to provide feedback.’" — AND THE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO MARK UP THE NDAA IN LATE JUNE, Connor adds: “House Armed Service Chairman Mac Thornberry [Tuesday] predicted the full committee will mark up the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act the final week of June, provided the president's budget rollout remains on track. “The White House is expected to formally unveil its budget proposal the week of May 22. Speaking to reporters, Thornberry said his committee aims to begin subcommittee action within a month of the budget's release. The ultimate aim, he said, is for the House to pass the NDAA before its month-long August recess.” NORTH KOREA PROTESTS U.S. FLYOVERS, reports The Wall Street Journal: “North Korea complained Tuesday about a flyover of a pair of U.S. supersonic bombers, as the Central Intelligence Agency’s director wrapped up a three-day visit to South Korea and the U.S. declared a missile-defense system that it is installing in South Korea operational. “The flurry of activity on the Korean Peninsula underscores U.S. President Donald Trump’s continuing focus on North Korea as he seeks a way to contain the threat from Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “It also came a day after Mr. Trump said that he would be “honored” to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.” And confirms the detention of a third American, reports the AP. As McCain calls Trump’s praise of Kim Jong Un “disturbing,” writes Louis. And South Koreans living near U.S.-provided anti-missile batteries protest their deployment amid fears they'll be targeted by North Korea, reports the AP. — U.S AND CHINA EYE A FIRMER U.N. STANCE, via Reuters: “The United States is negotiating with China on a possible stronger U.N. Security Council response — such as sanctions — to North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches, which the 15-member body normally condemns in a statement, diplomats said. “It was not immediately clear how open Beijing might be to new sanctions. The council has traditionally boosted sanctions in response to North Korea's five nuclear tests and two long-range rocket launches.” Trump’s turn towards China curtails Navy patrols in disputed zones, adds the NYT. And Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China says he’ll work with Beijing on North Korea, writes The Washington Post. NSA COLLECTS AMERICANS’ PHONE RECORDS DESPITE LAW CHANGE, writes Reuters: “The U.S. National Security Agency collected more than 151 million records of Americans' phone calls last year, even after Congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records, according to an annual report issued on Tuesday by the top U.S. intelligence officer. “The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism. “It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year.” WAR REPORT — TRUMP AND PUTIN TALK SYRIA CEASE-FIRE, reports The Washington Post: “In their first publicly announced conversation since the United States launched a Tomahawk cruise-missile strike in Syria last month, President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the humanitarian crisis in Syria in a phone call Tuesday, with both countries expressing interest in working toward a cease-fire in the region. “The two men also discussed the possibility of trying to organize a personal meeting at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg in July, according to a readout of the call provided by the Kremlin. The White House did not immediately confirm whether Trump agreed to try to meet with Putin in Germany.” ISIS kills dozens near a Syria refugee camp, reports the NYT. And an explosion near the Turkish border kills five, Syrian activists say via the AP. — SUICIDE BOMBING ON U.S. MILITARY CONVOY KILLS EIGHT AFGHANS, via the NYT: “At least eight Afghan civilians were killed and three American soldiers wounded on Wednesday when a suicide bomber tried to attack an American military convoy during the morning rush hour in Kabul, officials said. “The explosion happened around the corner from one of the entrances of the heavily guarded United States Embassy at the center of the Afghan capital, and the target was a convoy of American soldiers passing through.” INDUSTRY INTEL — DEFENSE FIRMS UNDER TRUMP’S EYE RELAX, writes Defense News: “When U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January promising heightened scrutiny of defense acquisition programs, Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s top executives reassured investors about their relationship with Trump and the affordability of their products. “Now it seems the Trump effect has worn off, at least a little.” — FUTURE BATTLEFIELD NEEDS ACQUISITIONS TO MATCH, Defense News adds: “Future soldiers may enter a battlefield alongside autonomous fighting vehicles on the ground and a "ghost fleet" of unmanned ships at sea, as swarms of miniature drones buzz overhead. “All the while, commanders will analyze data from social networks to understand the public sentiment and trends as the fighting unfolds.” “This is what the battlefield of the future likely will resemble.” TOP DOC — THE WORKLOAD OUTPACES LABOR IN SHIPYARDS, RAND SAYS, via Jacqueline: “The workload in the Navy’s public shipyards is growing as the workforce is becoming less experienced, a new RAND report concludes … ” “The study found that the workload has increased as the number of ships that the service needs to maintain, especially aircraft carriers, has grown. At the same time, the amount of work that must be done during each availability on the aging ships has increased, too.” And Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.) calls for a shipbuilding boost to signal to the industry it’s time to ramp-up, Jacqueline adds.

Only two people on the ground suffered minor injuries, with one going to the hospital. The pilot, a 30-year-old man from Oregon, reported no injuries. "I'm so lucky," driver Amanda Hayes told KOMO News. She said the wing's plane scraped her car. "I just said, 'Get down!' And before I know it, I could feel the heat on my face... and like the fireball and the wing clipped at the end." "When it was over, I wasn't sure if we were OK, if our van was OK. I don't know, that's probably the closest I've come to really thinking, 'oh this is the end, ' " she said. Motorist Guanting Li captured the crash on his dashcam. The plane, a single-engine Piper PA32, crashed in Mukilteo after losing power on takeoff from Paine Field, which is near the road and is the home base for Boeing's massive Everett assembly facility. The plane struck clipped a powerline and a traffic signal, which ruptured its fuel tank - raining burning fuel on the cars below. The plane the skidded to a stop in the road. The crash and ensuing power outage created gridlock, as the busy Mukilteo Speedway thoroughfare was shut down for the evening commute. Create alerts for any tag below Subscribe Etc.

(Contributed photo/Lockheed Martin)((Contributed photo/Lockheed Martin)) By Christopher Harress charress@al.com With a decision on where the F-35 multirole jet fighter will be based due in the summer, Alabama's congressional delegation is still trying hard to persuade the Pentagon that that 187th Fighter Wing at Dannelly Field Air Guard Station in Montgomery is the right fit for the $1.5 trillion jet. "We're making the case to the Air Force why Montgomery, Alabama, and the 187th Fighter Wing are an ideal fit," said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, to the Montgomery Advertiser. "This would be a really big deal for the River Region and for our state. It's too early to say whether we'll get the opportunity, but I promise you we're doing everything in our power to land the F-35." The Alabama state capitol is one of the five finalists for the advanced Lockheed Martin-built fighter jet. Others include Boise, Idaho; Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit; and Madison, Wisconsin. The F-35, which formally began development in 1996, has been a divisive project for lawmakers over the last five years. The aircraft has had significant delays as costs soared far above the original estimates. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairmen John McCain (R-Az.) and his House counterpart, Mac Thornberry of Texas, have both criticized the jet while also promising that large acquisition project like the F-35 would not be authorized in the future. Since President Donald Trump ascended to the Oval Office in January, he has openly criticized the aircraft, calling on lawmakers and the Pentagon to get a better deal, while also prompting rival jet maker Boeing to refit its F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to challenge the F-35 for new military contracts. Speaking in December, the former New York real estate tycoon said that the F-35 program and it associated costs were "out of control." The Super Hornet costs between $67 million and $70 million apiece, while the F-35 comes in at between $101 million and $135 million, depending on the variant. Those costs are expected to come down over the 50 year manufacturing lifespan of the F-35. Along with Roby, Democrat Terri Sewell also supports the aircraft coming to the state. "We've done everything we can to promote the legacy of the 187th, the need for it and how we're poised to be able to accommodate the Air Force's needs,'' she said. Senator Richardy Shelby said that the air force fighter wing has "a good program" with "good people." GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, so often a big voice when it comes to military and veterans issues, strongly welcomed the news that Alabama was still pushing hard to get the F-35.   "This would be a major coup for Montgomery, but for Alabama in general as we continue to grow and expand our military footprint," Byrne said in a statement. "I believe the 187th is a perfect fit for the F-35, and I will continue to work with our delegation to advocate for Montgomery. Ultimately, this is a decision that the Air Force will make, but I think we are putting the full court press on them."

Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said the ministry viewed the incident seriously and an investigation was being conducted to determine its cause. “I have ordered DCA to submit a report on the investigation. We know the mishap should not have taken place. It is a serious incident because it rarely took place at KLIA. We will investigate an incident, no matter how small. Wait for the report. “We will investigate all angles including the tyres used, runway, weather... whether it was very windy and what caused the tyres to burst. We will also check MAS’ maintenance to get to the root of the incident and ensure it can be solved,” he said. Liow was met by reporters after an event participated by MAS in the “Negaraku” initiative which was witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak at Bangunan Perdana Putra here today. He said DCA director-general Datuk Seri Azharuddin Abdul Rahman would personally look at the situation at KLIA and conduct an in-depth investigation. After the incident, follow-up actions were taken to ensure all infrastructure, runways, safety and security at KLIA were boosted from time to time, he said. Following the incident at 7.13am yesterday, involving a Boeing 738 aircraft, Runway 2 at KLIA was closed until further notice. Meanwhile, MAS chief executive officer Peter Bellew said the flat tyres could have been caused by a piece of debris on the runway when the flight took off in Jakarta, Indonesia or while landing at KLIA. “We are not sure, but we are conducting a thorough investigation. It is just like having a flat tyre but this tyre is very expensive. It did some damage to the aircraft but there was no drama. We apologise for the delay. Safety always comes first,” he added. — Bernama                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week It’s Melaka, not Malacca from now on Teach for Malaysia co-founder: Pay teachers well so we can get better students MCMC’s guide for chat admins: Deal with trolls PAS’ holier than thou attitude same as IS, Amanah leader says DBKL moves against foreign traders Over 600 religious schools unregistered 12-year-old forced to quit chess tournament over ‘seductive’ dress Johor religious department absolves school in fatal abuse case Religious school tells its side in case of boy who died after losing legs Report: Malaysian women sell homes, take up loans to be with IS lovers in Syria Most Watched Now Week Epic ‘Dark Tower’ trailer unleashed Netflix unveils official trailer for ‘The Defenders’ Things get gory in new TV spot for ‘Alien: Covenant’ Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles MAS aircraft tyres deflated after KLIA landing, runway closed RM50m ‘Park and Ride’ project for Rawang MCA says no surprise if PAS dumps PKR Road charge on Thai vehicles to start soon, transport minister says DCA asked to prepare SOP for flight crew interviews, says Riot Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

That ruling allows private citizens and corporations to make unlimited donations for political campaigns. By MichaelBrush Columnist Thanks to millennials, socially responsible investing is now a big deal. Investment funds dedicated to sustainable investing rose 33% during 2014-16 to $8.72 trillion, says the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. Millennials no doubt played a big role in this. More than 70% of them say they favor sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. It’s a trait they picked up from their baby-boomer parents. This is all well and good, but many sustainable investing devotees, young and old, have a blind spot that needs fixing. Blame it on the so-called “experts” in the industry. They make a big deal of avoiding fossil fuel companies and polluters. The environment isn’t the only thing that needs minding. We also need a sustainable democracy. Without that, it doesn’t matter how clean the environment is. Life could get ugly. And make no mistake, sustainable democracy is at risk. No, this isn’t another Donald Trump rant. Democracy was precarious before he came into office. A key turning point was in 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled against government restrictions on corporate political spending in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Since companies have deep pockets, their interests may trample those of average voters. In short, it’s hard to say which did more harm, Citizens United or the Gulf oil spill, as baby boomer Jackson Browne wrote in his song “The Long Way Around.” Whatever you think about Citizens United, it’s not going away soon. The best thing to do now is to learn how to contain the potential damage. For socially responsible investors, this means favoring companies with these three traits in the arena of campaign contributions: • Political spending transparency • Policies governing how they donate • Strong board oversight of managements’ campaign contributions Above all, these qualities help shareholders understand how companies are contributing to politicians. If investors disagree, they can sell their shares or challenge boards of directors and management. Openness and board oversight help prevent managers from secretly going rogue with campaign contributions that work against shareholder values. All of this seems fairly obvious. So it’s odd that the “sustainable investing” experts often put little emphasis on investing in sustainable democracy. A list of “sustainable investing” themes from Arabesque Asset Management, which you can find in this note, appears comprehensive. It includes 30 topics of interest — everything from carbon emissions and community relations, to diversity and CEO pay. What about political campaign contributions and investing in sustainable democracy? Nowhere to be seen. In a way, this isn’t surprising, since definitions of “sustainable” investing are all over the map. Center for Political Accountability The first stop for investors wanting to invest in sustainable democracy is the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) website. CPA examines the websites of S&P 500 SPX, -0.13%   companies to gauge whether they have 24 qualities that CPA says companies need in the realm of campaign contributions. The big picture is that CPA is looking for the three qualities I mentioned above: transparency, policy and board oversight. CPA then ranks S&P 500 companies on a scale of 0-100. You can find a spreadsheet with rankings here. This ranking serves two purposes: • It tells you as an investor which companies are “doing the right thing.” It’s a handy guide to investing in sustainable democracy. • The rating system also pressures companies to change their ways if they aren’t up to snuff. “It is pushing companies to more broadly disclose their political spending and political spending policies, where no disclosure is required by law,” says Bruce Freed, CPA’s president and founder. “There are a growing number of companies that take our index seriously that are looking to strengthen the way they oversee and disclose political spending.” Sustainable performance A big question for investors is whether sustainable investing hurts performance. One theory says it should help. Consider companies that are more “responsible” because they are more transparent and they take the long view on matters like the environment. They may also naturally make wiser long-term business decisions and attract more customers because of good will. Research results vary. Arabesque Asset Management claims 80% of academic studies found the stocks of companies with “good sustainability practices” outperform other stocks. Morningstar thinks social impact funds gained about 5% annually in the past 10 years, lagging behind other funds by about a percentage point a year. Morgan Stanley seems to be in the middle, concluding in this note that sustainable investments have “usually met, and often exceeded, the performance of comparable traditional investments.” I think investing in a sustainable democracy may well give you an edge, for two reasons. 1. Better governance I had a hunch that companies ranking high in CPA’s system also have solid corporate governance, which can work in your favor as an investor. So I asked Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to help check. ISS assigns companies a corporate governance rating, called ISS QualityScore, based on four factors: board structure and independence, executive pay policies, shareholder rights, and audit and risk oversight. Here’s what we found. The top 48 ranked companies in CPA’s system (those with a score of 90% or higher) had a median corporate governance risk rating of 4 on the ISS 1-10 scale, where a lower score is better. The bottom 48 companies, which all got a 0% rating from CPA, had a median ISS rating of 7.5. (A higher ISS score is worse.) This makes sense, because companies that are generally more open and transparent with shareholders tend to get better governance scores, says John Roe, head of ISS Analytics. But he also cautions the sample size is too small to draw definitive conclusions on whether CPA scores are a proxy for governance scores. 2. Better results To test how you’d do if you used CPA’s system as a sustainable democracy investment guide, I looked at how well CPA’s top 48 companies did against the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP, -0.32%   I chose this ETF because I used a simple equal weighting of the companies, so this ETF is the fairest comparison. (In contrast, the S&P 500 Index that most people track uses a market-cap weighted system. This means that smaller companies have a smaller impact on overall index returns.) The results are remarkable. CPA’s top 48 stocks beat the market by 7 percentage points over the past three years. From the start of 2011 through Feb. 21 of this year, CPA’s stocks returned 41.5% compared with 34.3% for the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. (For reference, the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Index did a little better. It advanced 36.1%. But the CPA stocks still beat that.) All returns include dividends. One pushback on my performance test might be that the CPA’s list of top-ranked companies may have over-represented companies in sectors that just happened to do well during that time frame. So I looked at a different time frame, the past five years. The results were even better. CPA’s top 48 stocks beat the market by 20 percentage points. They advanced 133.3% vs. 113.3% for the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (and 108.9% for the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Index). Some of the best-performing stocks in this group, in either time frame, included: Bank of America Corp. BAC, +1.02% Morgan Stanley MS, +0.30% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.58% Visa Inc. V, -0.11% Altria Group Inc. MO, -0.86% Time Warner Inc. TWX, -0.28% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.32% Boeing Co. BA, -0.03% Becton Dickinson & Co. BDX, -0.82% Celgene Corp. CELG, -0.31% Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW, -0.23%  and Tesoro Corp. TSO, +0.01% Some of the weaker performers included: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.30% Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.16% Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +2.25% Praxair Inc. PX, -0.03% Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, +0.11% Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, -2.01% Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, -1.59% Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, +0.91% Noble Energy Inc. NBL, -3.95%  and Exelon Corp. EXC, -1.39% Before you conclude that my mini-study proves you can “do well by doing right,” as the cliché goes, a few qualifiers are in order. Statisticians would point out that there’s no attempt to tease out what caused the performance difference. Correlation does not equal causation. The sample size is small. And there are only two time frames. Plus, my test for outperformance against a rising market might be the wrong way to look at this. Here’s what I mean. Let’s assume I’m right that CPA scores are a way to measure corporate governance. The nuance here is that quality corporate governance is really better at suggesting possible protection against downside risk, as opposed to outperformance, says Roe, the head of ISS Analytics. Give a little Even if investing in sustainable democracy didn’t help you outperform the market, does this really matter? After all, if socially responsible investing is about putting money into the stocks of companies that share your values, then maybe it’s OK to give up some gains in the process. People give up money and time whenever they donate to charities or volunteer. There is a cost to those activities. But it’s offset by the benefit of knowing you might be improving the world. Why should investing be any different? A lot of millennials seem to agree with this. Over half of them in the Morgan Stanley study I cited above said they get it that sustainable investing may involve some trade-off in financial gain — yet they are some of the biggest fans of this style of investing.

This macro trend is alive and well in travel. Larger travel companies use these models to capitalize on new ideas, markets and technologies that startups pursue. These investments are intended not only to keep close to potential threats to an established business model. There is also a very clear incentive for these companies to be active participants in the industry’s future. Without a stake in potentially disruptive technologies, industry players are either forced to innovate on their own – or face an even-more uncertain future defined exclusively by others. Clearly a commitment to travel startups has become de rigeur in travel. Here’s a detailed look at the ecosystem as it stands today. The GDS: Amadeus and Travelport In May 2015, Amadeus jumped into bed with incubator program Travel Startups to launch Amadeus for Startups. Given that many startups seem to be unfamiliar with the extraordinary complexities of travel, the initiative is primarily focused on education. In announcing the efforts, Amadeus North America’s vice president of online travel said that the effort will align “the technology, investment and academic communities to offer new travel companies a simplified, affordable consulting partnership.” The company is mum in specifics, but claims to have nurtured “dozens of online startup travel and search companies, as well as developers and travel content providers.” Beyond startups, the company also has Amadeus Ventures, which focuses on strategic co-investments in late-stage travel startups. Investments here include Bluesmart, BookingPal, Eva, Yapta, Flyr, and Betterez, as well as successful exits from Cabify (stake sold during subsequent investment rounds) and Olset (purchased by Deem for an undisclosed amount). The investments have slowed somewhat over the past year. Travelport Labs is another approach from the GDS segment. The format of this program is more TechStars-style, with two classes per year and accept up to six teams per class. The Labs program has graduated two classes, with a total of nine graduates so far. Startups accepted into the program will receive a four-month crash course into the world of Travelport, based at the company’s Denver offices. According to the company’s terms, Travelport invests $30,000 in up to ten companies each year, in return for an 8% equity stake. Helping founders and seeing startups learn fast is our jam. https://t.co/MXc9rnRP0i #accelerator #traveltech @raymondcollins3 @wolorewards pic.twitter.com/ZfXZREVGzA — Travelport Labs (@TravelportLabs) April 10, 2017 It makes sense for the primary inventory platforms in travel to get involved at the earlier stages of startups. As early companies make decisions on where to source inventory, the larger entity enjoys a deeper integration with its distribution system. Not to mention the energy and potential future hires that come out of the startup ecosystem. The agencies: Booking.com, Flight Centre and Carlson Wagonlit Booking.com recently announced its first set of startups for its Booster program. Ten businesses will experience a three-week sprint, culminating in a chance to compete for grants of up to 500,000 Euros. These are grants, rather than investments, which makes the program especially unique. The global scope of both the company and the OTA sector has led to a cohort from across the word. Flight Centre looked to its founding story for its incubator, which is named after the first bus: Little Argas. The slogan is to “become a market leader and go global,” which the travel agency promises to offer its chosen startups. The objective is familiar: “Our goal is to work with our partners to nurture new business ideas and fast track travel start-up companies incorporating areas of our DNA. We want to be the destination of choice for a wide range of travel and technology start-ups.” The company partners with current travel startup incubators to help screen, incubate and accelerate startups, which are then plugged into the relevant parts of the group’s experts. The company is actively seeking diversification outside of its core business across a long-term, twenty year horizon. There’s no set amount for the fund, but the company will invest up to $50,000 for 7.5 percent equity. For later stage companies, there’s up to $300,000 for growth and up to $2 million for scaling up. Little Argas made its first investment recently take a stake in an artificial intelligence tools for business travel. While Carlson Wagonlit Travel doesn’t have a standalone incubation process, it has tested the waters as a partner to other organizations supporting travel startups. In 2015, Carlson Wagonlit Travel joined the Paris travel incubator Welcome City Lab as a founding member. A year later the company also inked a partnership with incubator Plug and Play to provide mentorship and support to travel and hospitality related startups. The hotels: Marriott and AccorHotels Hotels are not as active in this space, as there are fewer obvious benefits. There are certainly new technologies that might benefit hotels but there’s not always a clear way to integrate this kind of program into the structure of the hotel business. One exception to this is Marriott. The massive global brand claims to have launched the first hotel innovation program. Called TestBed, the ambitious effort offered startups access to a real-world hotel to test their products. This offered a completely fresh way for a startup to go from product to development, and then use an operational hotel to pilot the technology. There were 150 startups up for consideration, and the two finalists were Dazzle (a voice activated assistant) and Jambo (a location-based professional platform). Another exception is AccorHotels, which captured global headlines with its acquisition of onefinestay for nearly €150 million. This was a capstone purchase, as the brand had several previous investments in accommodation-related startups. The company has also been actively pursuing new strategies, including an investment in digital distribution to move beyond simply its own hotels. Accor has also employed a more internal model for incubating new concepts in hospitality. Outside a hackathon in Russia, the company has focused resources on pushing its internal teams to think like startups, listen to customers, and disrupt its own core business. The result is its new Jo&Joe concept, which will ramp up to 50 units by 2020. By employing the same techniques that startups use, the company hopes to evolve its own business alongside its external investments and acquisitions. The airlines: JetBlue, British Airways, EasyJet and El Al JetBlue has been one of the most active investors in emerging travel and transportation companies. Its venture arm, JetBlue Technology Ventures, invested in a startup called Zunum Aero alongside Boeing. JTV president Bonny Simi explained why the airline made the investment: “We believe that electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry. By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” As a guiding focus, JTV “invest in, incubates and partner with early-stage startups at the intersection of technology, travel and hospitality. JTV has also formed a partnership with Israeli airline El Al on a project called Navigator. The partnership stems from El Al’s own innovation initiative, a centre based in Tel Aviv called Cockpit. Navigator is a four-month accelerator program for startups focused on aviation. According to a joint press release, the program includes access to “strategic partners, initial funding and ongoing close guidance.” Chosen companies will spend three months being mentored in Tel Aviv, followed by one month in Silicon Valley. British Airways is one of the most active legacy airlines in this space, originally launching its UnGrounded Innovation Lab in the Sky back in 2013. More recently, its parent company IAG created a standalone accelerator called Hangar 51. The initial pilot was successful, and the program was repeated again last year. Out of 450 applications, twenty-six startups were selected and four moved on to a ten-week mentorship program with executives. IAG recently announced its investment in two startups as part of the Hangar 51 initiative. The manufacturers: Boeing and Airbus Boeing recently made headlines with its investment in Zunum. The startup is in the early stages of manufacturing an electric-powered regional jet that could make short-haul flying far more economical. The jet is expected to take off starting in 2020. As far as range, the planes can fly up to 700 miles in the earliest configurations. And the planes are small. With only ten to fifty seats, airlines would be able to operate the jets on routes without enough demand for larger regional aircraft.This makes them viable for plugging gaps in regional travel ecosystems. The investment is one of the first for Boeing’s investment arm, HorizonX. Principal Steve Nordlund explains the fund’s goals: “Our charter is to look beyond the horizon. We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.” As far as why he chose to invest in Zunum, Nordlund says: “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors. As well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.” The company also invested an undisclosed amount in Upskill, a company that provides Google Glass-style technology for assembly workers. Airbus is certainly not out of the race. In 2015, the French firm landed in Silicon Valley with a centre capitalized by a $150 million fund. The A³ group is tasked with building “the future of flight now, by disrupting Airbus Group and its competitors before someone else does”. Cargo and logistics have also seen some interest from airlines, with Lufthansa Cargo participating as an inaugural partner for the Rocketspace Tech Accelerator.

There is more money entering the travel tech ecosystem right now than at any other time. I was at a travel tech conference today in San Francisco and I sent a startup founder to read this post. Funny thing is that we were working on writing up something similar but TNOOZ beat us to the punch. When we launched Travel Startups Incubator in late 2014 there was literally no one funding startups, today there are at least 20 investors dedicated to investing in startups in travel tech at the pre-seed/seed stage many of which you listed here. Kudos to the corporate travel venture arms for stepping in to fund startups in one of the biggest industries in the world. Reply 1 week ago   Mahtab Beheshti Thank you for pointing out this article Matt. The startup you told about is mine: tndnature.com. I’ll be looking at these incubators closely. Reply 1 day ago   Russell Winter In my experience, when corporations start venture capital divisions it is the sign of the start of a “bubble.” I liken it to when one’s neighbours start investment clubs. As word spreads, more jump in, scared to miss the boat, and then reality sets in with a crash. I laud innovation, but frankly a lot of companies that corporations are investing in at the moment are marginal at best in my opinion.

Matthew A. Foster/Released) In slides presented to the Army Aviation Association of America's annual summit, attendees got a peek at some of the Block II modifications coming to the CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopter. The slides were presented by Brigadier General Thomas Todd, the Program Executive Officer for Army Aviation.  In them, modifications previously known, like new rotor blades and a strengthened airframe were laid out. But other upgrades, like fuel tank modifications, an improved drive train and redesigned flight controls were also revealed. In an April 12 interview, Brigadier General Todd said that the Block II was "specifically designed to return [a] commander's payload to him on the battlefield." On that same day, Brig. Gen. Todd also revealed that the Chinook Block II had passed "Milestone B" in the acquisition process, enabling it to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. It is now a formal program of record. Initial production (or Milestone C) is expected in 2021.  In the slides, Brig. Gen. Todd lays out the following modifications as proposals for the Block II. Electrical systems modification to improve emergency power ARC-321 communications system integration  Fuel system modifications, such as improved information, externally replaceable pumps, composite pods and a new single tank Advanced rotor blades from composite material Drive train upgrades, such as transmission improvements and upgraded rotor shafts Common Avionics Architecture System upgrades Flight control upgrades such as redesigned trim actuators, and a Digital Advanced Flight Control System update Airframe improvements, including a strengthened aft section, pylon and nose section.  When the Chinook Block II entered the EMD phase, Boeing, the aircraft's prime contractor released the following statement, saying "today’s heavy-lift helicopters must handle heavier equipment at higher altitudes and warmer temperatures. We’re working closely with the U.S. Army to design and manufacture upgrades to the Chinook focused on increasing payload, providing commonality across the fleet and creating a foundation for affordable future upgrades. Block II will pave the way for the Chinook to remain operational to support our customer’s needs through 2060."  Once the Block II enters service, older Block I Ch-47F's are expected to be upgraded to the Block II standard. It will provide increased payload, and begin the process of moving to a new engine, known as the Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE).  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

Net earnings for the quarter to end March were CAD$48.3 million (USD$35.2 million), down from the previous year period’s CAD$87.6 million. Revenue came in at CAD$1.11 billion in the quarter, an 8 percent increase, but expenses rose 13.7 percent to CAD$1.03 billion. Fuel was the biggest contributor to increased costs, up 41.5 percent to CAD$235.5 million. WestJet carried 5.69 million passengers during the quarter, a 6.8 percent increase on 1Q16. RPM traffic was also up 6.8 percent on an ASM capacity increase of 5.5 percent. Load factor came in at 83 percent, a 0.9 percentage point increase. Yield was 1.2 percent higher at 17.43 Canadian cents, with RASM (revenue per available seat mile) up 2.3 percent to 14.47 cents. Cost per available seat mile (CASM) was up 7.8 percent at 13.42 cents. WestJet chief executive Gregg Saretsky said the airline was seeing good results from its premium economy product, growth in WestJet Rewards and penetration into the business travel segment, “all of which gives us confidence that RASM will continue to improve for the remainder of the year.” WestJet also announced an order for 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft to be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021. The firm order is worth just under USD$2.3 billion at current Boeing list prices. The purchase agreement includes options for an additional 10 787-9s to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. WestJet will use General Electric's GEnx-1B engines on the 787s. CEO Saretsky said the order would allow the airline to “turn our attention to further growing our international presence.” WestJet’s international destinations include the Caribbean and London Gatwick in addition to US locations. WestJet will convert 15 firm orders for Boeing 737 MAXs to options available between 2022 and 2024.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next WATKINS, Colo. -- After an approximately five-year effort, Spaceport Colorado may finally be taking off. An official tells Denver7 the spaceport hopes to get a license from the federal government by the end of the year. Located at Front Range Airport in Watkins, the spaceport would be a place for spacecraft to take off and land.   Currently there are 11 approved sites by the federal government in the U.S. So far, $860,000 has been spent to get a license.  Denver International Airport, the city of Aurora, Adams County, and the Federal Aviation Administration are among those contributing to the funding. The operation could create jobs from a $300 billion industry. Colorado already has a strong space presence from giants like Boeing and Sierra Nevada. “If everything went great for a company like Virgin Galactic, you could see them with a commercial license within the new couple of years, and a couple of years after that, being able to actually operate at a place like Spaceport Colorado,” said director David Ruppel. Such a development is exciting to longtime aviators. “As hokey as it may be, kind of that final frontier, right?” said Brian Eaton, the chief pilot at Front Range Flight School. Enjoy this content?

ROS LBoard 1 Pakatan Harapan invites public to submit logo design FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US New routes, more staff for Malaysia Airlines by year-end Reuters | May 4, 2017 CEO Peter Bellew says company evaluating at least 26 more routes that could be introduced by 2018. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines will add 11 new routes and embark on a hiring spree by year-end amid a boost in demand from international customers, Chief Executive Peter Bellew said on Wednesday. The Malaysian national carrier is in the midst of a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014 – when flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing mysteriously disappeared, and flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in eastern Ukraine. Bellew said the number of routes being introduced now was the most in a single year in the airline’s history, and that the company was evaluating at least 26 more routes that could be introduced by 2018. The airline, he said, was seeing an increase in customers in Asia, particularly from China, India and Australia, despite a fall in the number of fliers to Europe and the United States. Malaysia Airlines was looking to hire more staff towards the end of this year and add several wide-body aircraft to its fleet. However, he did not discuss on how many jobs would be introduced. The company was de-listed from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2014, and had removed around 6,000 jobs, at least a third of its workforce, at the peak of the airline’s crisis in 2015. “Business is very good at the moment… business on the international front is extremely strong,” he told reporters in Putrajaya, Malaysia’s administrative capital. “We need more pilots, more crew, engineers and everything.” Last month, Bellew told Reuters the airline was looking to lease between six and eight Airbus A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and another seven to nine aircraft from 2019. The company aims at a return to profitability by 2018, and a stock market listing again in March the following year.

Bernstein/Bloomberg House Passes Spending Bill That Omits Most Trump Priorities by Anna Edgerton @annaedge4 More stories by Anna Edgerton and Erik Wasson @elwasson More stories by Erik Wasson May 3, 2017, 4:20 PM EDT May 3, 2017, 6:19 PM EDT $1.17 trillion measure avoids shutdown through September Senate to vote before current funds expire at midnight Friday The House passed a shutdown-avoiding $1.17 trillion spending bill that President Donald Trump plans to sign even though Democrats were able to defeat most of his wish list, including money for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The 309-118 vote Wednesday sends the measure to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hopes to hold a vote Thursday. While the measure buys peace for five months, Trump on Tuesday threatened a "good shutdown" in September or a Senate rule change to keep the minority party from wielding similar power on the next spending plan. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Democrats claimed victory over Republicans on the bipartisan measure, which excluded funding for the southern border wall and avoided $18 billion in domestic spending cuts sought by Trump. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney accused Democrats of “spiking the football” and said the bill’s $21 billion in added defense spending -- which includes $6 billion from the Obama administration -- was a win for Republicans. "This is a great deal for the president," White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters before the vote. Those voting for the spending bill included 131 Republicans and 178 Democrats, while the measure was opposed by 103 Republicans and 15 Democrats. Trump will sign the spending measure if passed by the Senate in its current form, the administration said in a statement. The White House did express concern about Congress’s lack of “fiscal restraint,” and Trump complained on Twitter that the compromise was needed because "we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!" ‘Uninformed and Irresponsible’ Second-ranking House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland sharply criticized Trump’s shutdown threat as "flippant, uninformed and irresponsible." The spending bill "reflects both rationality and reasonableness" and includes provisions backed by both parties, he said on the House floor. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said in an interview, "This sets the framework for the next negotiations and the dynamics aren’t going to change; they’re still going to need our votes.” Wednesday’s vote was overshadowed in the House by intense talks over whether Republicans will gain enough support to vote on their plan to overhaul Obamacare. Key holdout Fred Upton of Michigan announced his support after offering an amendment to provide more federal funds for people with pre-existing conditions. GOP leaders hope to hold a vote before leaving for a week-long recess. The spending bill agreement demonstrates the constraints on a unified Republican government that still needs Democratic help to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. With 52 Republican senators and a fractured GOP majority in the House, most legislation still needs bipartisan support to become law. A number of House Republicans regularly refuse to support large spending bills. Puerto Rico Democrats succeeded in eliminating 160 policy provisions they opposed, secured health benefits for retired miners and helped Puerto Rico fund its Medicaid program. Instead of placing stricter limits on legal immigration, the spending bill extends an investor visa program, expands a low-skilled workers’ visa program and would allow thousands of more Afghan refugees. House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the bill’s increased military spending and called it a win for Republicans. "Many of our priorities are advanced in this, and that’s because this is a bipartisan piece of legislation," Ryan said on the House floor before the vote. "It turns the page on the last administration, on the Obama years." House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows of North Carolina said Wednesday that he would vote against the omnibus spending bill due to "a lack of conservative priorities" in it and that the next spending measure should reflect Republican control of the White House, Senate and the House. "If we do not do things differently there will be a day of reckoning in about two years in November of 2018," Meadows said. The measure would make only a small spending cut for the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump wanted to slash, while the National Institutes of Health, also on Trump’s chopping block, would receive a $2 billion increase. The bill, H.R. 244, has an additional $1.5 billion for border security, including 5,000 more immigration detention beds, though that money can’t be spent on a border wall. Debate on Wall “This summer we will have a big debate and decision about the full longer-term funding for the wall,” Ryan said earlier Wednesday in an interview with a Wisconsin radio station. Wall Street lobbyists lost their fight to have the bill curb Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Dodd-Frank bank regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission will be funded at $1.6 billion and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at $250 million, the same amounts as in 2016. New defense spending in the measure is geared toward weapons programs, a boon to defense contractors General Dynamics Corp., Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., Austal Ltd. and Boeing Co. The bill also authorizes intelligence policies through September, creating an interagency committee to counter and curtail Russian intelligence activities following that country’s interference in the 2016 election. The intelligence provisions seek to monitor and limit the movements of Russia diplomats in the U.S. The secretary of state and intelligence agency chiefs would establish an advance notification system for all Russian accredited diplomatic and consular personnel in the U.S., as well as a way to ensure diplomats comply and to address violations. Republicans plan in coming weeks to introduce a fiscal 2018 budget resolution to jump-start the next round of spending bills needed to keep the government open starting Oct. 1.

By Joe Patrice May 3, 2017 at 11:56 AM Shares10 So who’s speaking at your graduation? We’ve been seeking intel on law school graduation speakers (and we’ll take cool full university speakers that you plan on attending as a law grad) for a week now and it’s time to publish our initial list. Thanks to everyone who wrote in and if you haven’t given us a shout, please do so. Hopefully you’re going to see someone noteworthy. It’d be a shame if you took some idiot’s advice on where to go to law school and missed out on seeing a celebrity. Just know that the pain of missing a riotous Mindy Kaling routine stings for a day, but student loans are non-dischargeable debt. Here’s what we have so far.

In unusually frank comments, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said poor decisions and under funding by successive governments had left the armed forces short of equipment and increasingly unable to do their job. "It's going to take a significant investment ... it's going to be significant because of the hole we need to come out of," he told a defense industry lunch. Canada currently devotes just under one percent of GDP on defense, less than it did in 2005. The Trump administration is focusing on the many NATO member states who have yet to meet a commitment to spend two percent of GDP. "We are now in the troubling position where status quo spending on defense will not even maintain a status quo of capabilities," said Sajjan. More details of planned spending will be revealed in a major defense policy review that is due to be released ahead of a NATO leaders' meeting this month. "The number that we'll be announcing is a number that meets the needs of Canada and our support for our allies," he said. Sajjan said he was particularly concerned by Ottawa's failure to acquire replacements for Canada's ageing fleet of CF-18 fighter jets, some of which have been flying for almost 40 years. He also highlighted problems with outdated trucks, excavation equipment and helicopters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jets for C$9 billion ($6.6 billion). They later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews. Sajjan said that if Canada were to fulfill its defense commitments both in North America and as a NATO member, it would in any case need more than 65 jets. "The C$9 billion in funding that was earmarked for the jet replacements by the previous government is nowhere near enough to even cover the 65 jets they proposed," he said. Last November, Canada unveiled plans to buy 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure while it prepared an open five-year competition to replace the CF-18s. Canada has experienced a string of military procurement problems since the early 1990s, variously featuring naval ships, search and rescue helicopters, fighter planes, trucks, close combat vehicles and submarines.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Electric Propulsion Satellite 2017 Global Market Expected To Grow At CAGR 13.95% And Forecast To 2021 The analysts forecast the global electric propulsion satellite market to grow at a CAGR of 13.95% during the period 2017-2021. PUNE, INDIA, May 3, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Global Electric Propulsion Satellite Market Description Electric-powered satellite propulsion system employs electrical energy to change the velocity of spacecraft. Most all-electric satellite propulsion systems work by electrically expelling propellant or reaction mass at high speed. The hybrid propulsion systems engage both chemical and electrical propulsion technologies. Conventional electric thrusters use less propellant than chemically powered propulsion systems as these have higher exhaust speeds, which operate at a higher specific impulse. However, the thrust generated by electric propulsion remains much weaker compared with its counterparts. Nevertheless, electric propulsion technology can ensure a small thrust for a longer period of time, which makes such technologies ideal for deep space exploration. Also, over a period of operation, such propulsion systems can feature high speed and thereby, ensure effective performance. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global electric propulsion satellite market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the procurement of hybrid propulsion satellite (the ones which used both chemical and electric propulsion technology) and all-electric satellites.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 3 May 2017 | MYT 5:12 PM Malaysia Airlines to add new routes, hire more staff by year-end Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Peter Bellew KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines will add 11 new routes and embark on a hiring spree by year-end amid a boost in demand from international customers, Chief Executive Peter Bellew said on Wednesday. The Malaysian national carrier is in the midst of a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014 – when Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing mysteriously disappeared, and Flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down in eastern Ukraine. Bellew said the number of routes being introduced now was the most in a single year in the airline's history, and that the company was evaluating at least 26 more routes that could be introduced by 2018. The airline, he said, was seeing an increase in customers in Asia, particularly from China, India and Australia, despite a fall in the number of fliers to Europe and the United States. Malaysia Airlines was looking to hire more staff towards the end of this year and add several wide-body aircraft to its fleet. However, he did not discuss on how many jobs would be introduced. The company was de-listed from the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 2014, and had removed around 6,000 jobs, at least a third of its workforce, at the peak of the airline's crisis in 2015. "Business is very good at the moment... business on the international front is extremely strong," he told reporters in Putrajaya, Malaysia's administrative capital. "We need more pilots, more crew, engineers and everything." Last month, Bellew told Reuters the airline was looking to lease between six and eight Airbus A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and another seven to nine aircraft from 2019. The company aims at a return to profitability by 2018, and a stock market listing again in March the following year. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: Airlines , Corporate News , Aviation , Malaysia Airlines , Peter Bellew Related Stories Related Stories Malaysia Airlines offers to lease A330s from Alitalia Mayday!
