(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) SEATTLE (The Seattle Times/TNS) - Boeing delivered 748 jets last year, fourteen fewer than in 2015, but still enough to leave it well ahead of rival Airbus in 2016 production. However, overall sales for the year slumped despite a year-end rush that saw it book 202 net orders in December, according to data released Friday. Boeing’s final 2016 tally was 668 net orders, exactly one hundred fewer jets sold than in the previous year. In a message to employees Friday, the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAlister, discussed a series of milestones achieved during the year. He cited the first flight of the 737 MAX and its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow in England; the delivery of the five hundredth 787 Dreamliner and in South Carolina the start of final assembly of the latest Dreamliner model, the 787-10; and the opening of the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, Wash. At list prices, the total value of Boeing’s 2016 net orders would be $94 billion. According to market pricing data from aircraft valuation firm Avitas, the real value after standard sales discounts is estimated at about $44 billion. The fact that the 668 jet sales total lags the 748 jet delivery total means that Boeing’s backlog of unfilled orders drops by eighty, the first time it’s fallen in seven years. Airbus won’t release its corresponding order and delivery figures until later this week, but as of the end of November its deliveries lagged Boeing’s by more than 100 jets, so it’s clear that it won’t match the U.S. plane-maker’s output. Airbus has struggled this year to meet its planned deliveries, beset by issues with the supply of Pratt & Whitney engines for its new A320neo jets and also with shortages of seats and other cabin interior parts. Of the planes Boeing delivered last year, 490 were the smaller 737 narrow-body jets assembled in Renton, Washington. Of the 258 larger wide-body jets Boeing built, the Everett plant assembled 197, including 99 large 777 twin-engine jets, 13 mid-size 767s and 76 all-composite 787 Dreamliners. The slight dip in overall production compared to 2015 was largely due to the rate cut in the 747 jumbo jet program. Boeing in 2016 delivered only nine 747s, exactly half the number delivered the previous year. Boeing’s assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., built 61 Dreamliners, according to Uresh Sheth, who tracks 787 production on the “All Things 787” blog. That means the South Carolina site is running at its full planned rate, building five 787s per month to Everett’s seven per month for a current total of 12 Dreamliners per month. Boeing had said it was considering going up to 14 Dreamliners per month toward the end of the decade, with seven jets built at each site, but lack of new sales now makes that unlikely. Indeed, several analysts, including industry observer Scott Hamilton, believe Boeing may have to drop the production rate back down to 10 Dreamliners per month. If that happens, it’s likely Boeing will balance production with five jets made at each assembly site — meaning that North Charleston maintains its current rate while Everett loses two jets per month. The outlook for 2017 is gloomier for Everett production and also projected sales. Boeing will cut 777 production in Everett this year in response to slow sales of the current model ahead of the debut of the replacement 777X. It will deliver nearly thirty fewer of the expensive big jets than last year. In contrast, Renton should see more work, with a planned rate hike on the 737 to forty-seven jets per month from the current forty-two per month. Airplane sales in 2017 are expected to continue at a low level as the airline industry worldwide faces a capacity glut. Yet, there will be important milestones for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the year ahead. In his employee message, McAlister said he’s looking forward to the first 737 MAX delivery, the MAX 8 model, as well as the rollout and first flight of two new airplane models, the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10.

On 6 January, Boeing published data on number of orders for its airplanes, which it received in 2016. According to US company, Uzbekistan Havo Yollari ordered four Boeing-787 Dreamliner jets. Boeing did not say, which model of Dreamliner the Uzbek airline ordered. In November 2016, Uzbekistan Havo Yollari stated that the airline will purchase three airplanes of Boeing-787-9 model. Currently Uzbekistan Havo Yollari uses two airplanes of Boeing-787-8 modification. The airline received them in August and November 2016. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It seats 250 to 330 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company’s most fuel-efficient airliner and the world’s first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction. According to Boeing, the 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. Subscribe to our Telegram channel to keep in touch with latest news.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video Space.com Spaceflight NASA Books More Astronaut Flights from SpaceX, Boeing By Elizabeth Howell, Space.com Contributor | January 4, 2017 03:46pm ET MORE NASA has ordered more private space taxi flights to the International Space Station using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft (left in artist's depiction) and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner (right). The agency has booked a total of six flights each from the companies starting in 2018. Credit: NASA NASA has booked more astronaut flights to the International Space Station aboard private space taxis built by Boeing and SpaceX. The new orders, which NASA announced Tuesday (Jan. 3), awards four crew rotation flights to the International Space Station (ISS) each to Boeing and SpaceX as part of the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. The award increases the total number of flights ordered from each contractor to six, NASA officials wrote in the announcement. These missions will be approved to fly after NASA certification, and will not include payments at this time. [SpaceX's Crewed Dragon Spaceship in Pictures] "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a statement. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program." The news comes as both SpaceX and Boeing are preparing for their first crewed flight tests in 2018. Under the current schedule, SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will fly an uncrewed mission in November, and then launch a crewed test flight in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner is scheduled to fly its first uncrewed test flight in June 2018, which will be followed by a crewed flight later in August of next year. Estimated flight dates have been pushed back several times before, however. Each vehicle will carry up to four astronauts and 220 lbs. (100 kilograms) of cargo to the ISS. They can also serve as "lifeboats" to bring astronauts back to Earth in the event of an emergency. [In Pictures: Boeing's CST-100 Starliner] Since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011, the agency has had to depend on buying seats aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which launch from Kazakhstan, to fly American astronauts to the space station. NASA currently has contracts with Russia's Roscosmos space agency to fly astronauts on six Soyuz flights in 2017 (for a total of $458 million). The agency will also pay Roscosmos another $490 million to fly astronauts on six more flights in 2018. Would you take a ride on SpaceX's Dragon space capsule? Yes - It would be the ride of a lifetime. Sign me up! No - It's a step backward from the reusable space plane design of the space shuttles. Maybe - I would wait a while for it to be proven safe. Get Results Share This NASA's Commercial Crew Program aims to restart crewed launches from American soil in 2018. Another long-range goal is to increase the crew size on the space station. Russia's Soyuz vehicles can only carry up to three people at a time. The Dragon and Starliner vehicles, by contrast, are designed to carry up to seven astronauts per flight. With more astronauts on the space station, NASA plans to increase the research time available on the orbiting complex. In recent years, observers have also expressed concerns about relying on a foreign government to send Americans to the space station, especially when political disputes occurred between Russia and the United States. Further, Russia is dependent on agreements with Kazakhstan for its Soyuz launches. Both Boeing and SpaceX will launch from facilities near Orlando, Florida. SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will leave Earth from Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The two companies have been upgrading human space transportation facilities in Florida to support these missions, from what was used during the space shuttle program.

Photo: Bloomberg Boeing Co on Friday said that its deliveries of commercial planes fell modestly last year and it saw fewer orders compared with 2015. The US aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015. Last year’s orders are worth US$94.1 billion at list prices, it said. Boeing’s rival Airbus Group SE in November last year said that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing’s most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company on Wednesday announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth US$8.25 billion, from General Electric Co’s airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January last year that it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing last month said it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes last year, up one from the prior year. Shares of Boeing rose 0.1 percent to US$158.87 on Friday. This story has been viewed 1896 times. Comments will be moderated.

It shows a Boeing Clipper flying boat, surely one of the most beautiful and romantic passenger airplanes ever built, taking off from Elliott Bay with Seattle’s familiar skyline in the background. Yet something’s not right. It’s a composite photo. The flying boat was photographed in Elliott Bay in 1941; the skyscrapers behind were snapped in 2013 and replace the much less imposing original Seattle backdrop. It’s clever because this is a book of historical photos — the images inside are undoctored — that’s organized by geography. Author Tim Nelson sets out to connect for readers a fascinating catalog of bygone aviation events with their precise location in the modern city and beyond. A full-time Boeing engineer who compiled the book as a labor of love, Nelson invites readers to follow his wandering along the roads of Seattle and Washington state and to find the spots where the book’s fascinating historical photos were taken. Most Popular 1 S.A. anchorwoman Evy Ramos said she was fired from WOAI-TV 2 Popovich handles Trump question in Mexico 3 NWS: Tornadoes, thunderstorms and heavy rain possible this... Some of the locations — Boeing Field, the Museum of Flight, Paine Field in Everett — are familiar to every airplane enthusiast. Others are more obscure, because little outward sign remains of a remarkable past: For example, the site of the Meadows racetrack where, on March 11, 1910, the first airplane flight in state history took off, is now occupied by Raisbeck Aviation High School.Nelson says he was motivated to pull the book together in part when Boeing’s historic Plant 2 — where during peak production in 1944, Boeing cranked out 16 B-17 bombers on a single April day — was demolished in 2010. “The realization hit me that a lot of these sites of very significant local history were not permanent,” said Nelson in an interview. And so he cataloged the state’s aviation firsts and their locations, and dug up photos of both then and now. Stand at the little pier that’s the northernmost tip of West Seattle and close your eyes to re-create Nelson’s photos of the old Luna Park, an early 20th-century Coney Island-style amusement park, and of the day in June 1908 when a huge football-shaped dirigible took the first semi-controlled human flight in the state, ending with a splash into Elliott Bay. More Information Jet City Rewind: Aviation History of Seattle and the Pacific Northwest By Tim Nelson Schiffer, $29.99 He pinpoints the row of attractive residential houseboats on the edge of Lake Union that’s the location of the hangar where Bill Boeing built the first Boeing airplanes 100 years ago. The Gorst Air Transport terminal at one of Seattle’s downtown piers — from where in the 1930s passengers flew in six-seater amphibious biplanes across Puget Sound to Bremerton — is now the site of an Ivar’s restaurant. And the decidedly prosaic A-1 Pallets company in the Kent Valley stands where Herb Munter in the 1920s established an airfield on a Green River cow pasture for charter and photography flights, including the first flight over Mount Rainier. Here, as in some other places listed in the book, Nelson is unfortunately forced to write that “no aviation traces remain.” Yet that serves to highlight the book’s contribution to local history. Its fabulous photos vividly render the ghost of this Jet City’s vanished past.

The blacked-out information includes dollar figures and engine specifications for the Denton Energy Center — as well as how much noise and pollution it will make. 1 of 2 DME says details of city’s $265M plant deal would boost competition By Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer pheinkel-wolfe@dentonrc.com Published: 07 January 2017 11:33 PM When city officials unveiled the most expensive capital project in Denton’s history last fall, they didn’t disclose any details to the public. And it looks like they never will. Denton Municipal Electric, the city’s electric department, is building a power plant on the city’s west side. We know some things. For example, the Denton Energy Center will have 12 natural-gas fired engines built by Wärtsilä, a Finnish company. A Missouri engineering firm, Burns & McDonnell, will design and supervise construction of the building that houses them. DME is part of the city government and much of its debt is backed by Denton taxpayers. Even so, DME’s position is that the public cannot be told the most basic information about the deal it made on the public’s behalf. Currently, the public has no way of finding out how much city government is paying Wärtsilä. They cannot know how much Denton is paying Burns & McDonnell, either. The Denton Energy Center is expected to cost $265 million or more. The only reason that figure is publicly available is because state law requires certain disclosures when a city issues bonds to finance a project. DME officials say disclosing any more information about the new power plant would put them at a competitive disadvantage in the Texas electric marketplace. Another power plant could figure out DME’s costs and beat the energy center’s bids to sell electricity to the grid. Phil Williams, DME’s general manager, said most of the buying, selling and trading of electricity in Texas is done by private utilities. The Texas Legislature changed open records laws so municipal utilities wouldn’t have to show any more cards than private utilities do in the Texas electric market. Without exemptions in open records laws, those private companies could get information to undercut public utilities, like DME. “Otherwise, it’s not fair and we don’t have a level playing field,” Williams said.   Massive blackouts DME has used those exemptions to keep private the specific details of its major business dealings for many years. The “purchase power agreements” set terms when DME buys electricity from wind and solar farms. The agreements also include terms for selling electricity to large customers, such as the University of North Texas. Last fall, DME sought the City Council’s approval to build the Denton Energy Center. Officials redacted, or blacked out, more than dollar figures in its contracts with Wärtsilä and Burns & McDonnell. They redacted how much noise the plant will make and how much air pollution the plant will emit. After a deeply divided City Council voted 4-3 to approve the deal, the Denton Record-Chronicle asked for complete, unredacted copies of the city’s contracts. Other people asked for complete, unredacted copies, too, including a reporter who wanted to write on the groundbreaking deal for a trade publication. Another person asked how many people DME would hire to run the plant. DME’s attorney, John Knight, appealed to the Texas attorney general’s office. He claimed all the information people sought needed to be kept secret. He cited a controversial decision by the Texas Supreme Court in 2015, Boeing Co. vs. Paxton. The state’s highest court told Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office Port San Antonio and Boeing could shield their lease terms from public scrutiny. Boeing operates an aircraft maintenance hub at the Port San Antonio development on the site of the old Kelly Air Force Base. In the past 18 months, the Texas attorney general’s office has received more than 300 requests from governmental entities, like DME, looking to shield their contract terms from public scrutiny, too. DME’s power plant deal was similar, Knight said. He claimed the Boeing decision gave Wärtsilä, Burns & McDonnell and the other firms that bid (but lost) on the Denton Energy Center a chance to keep their information secret. Those secret bids were the only way DME could be sure it was getting the best deal for ratepayers, Williams said. Among the losing bidders, only General Electric asked to continue to keep its bid a secret. Wärtsilä and Burns & McDonnell asked that their bids and contract terms continue to be kept secret, even after the contracts were signed. The two firms have worked together on similar projects elsewhere in Texas and are likely to bid on more. The Texas attorney general’s office agreed the Boeing decision applied and sided with DME and the three companies. They said DME could keep the information secret: not only dollar figures, but also noise and emissions calculations. DME’s contracts to build and run the plant aren’t different from other purchase power agreements, Williams said. Moreover, the deals are scrutinized. Both the City Council and their appointees on the Public Utilities Board review the agreements on behalf of the public. “Fourteen individuals are aware of the details,” Williams said. So far, the Denton Energy Center and DME’s goals to buy more electricity from renewable sources are “on target,” Williams said. He expected construction of the power plant to cost less than $265 million once it is finished. In addition, even though the new plant won’t make electricity until 2018, the power plant deal helped DME negotiate its first wind power deal on better terms than expected, Williams said, adding more wind and solar deals are coming. DME officials say the new power plant will keep them in the driver’s seat — buying, selling and trading on their own terms, keeping rates low for customers in the future.   A two-headed DME DME is somewhere in between a private company and a government utility. It is increasingly different from the other 70-plus municipally owned electric utilities in Texas. Other municipalities employ a private utility to do their buying, selling and trading on the Texas grid. DME does its own trading. Williams and many other executives came to DME from TXU or other private-sector utilities. They created a special unit that can buy, sell and trade electricity in the Texas market. Williams said that unit already has saved millions for ratepayers in the two years it has operated. DME also has become increasingly secretive about its budget matters in the past two years. Last summer’s budget talks for the city-owned utility stayed behind closed doors. DME used to announce with pride its purchase of wind and solar power and how much closer it got the utility to its goal of 70 percent renewable energy by 2019. But no more. That’s now considered a competitive matter. An open-records activist asked how many people DME would hire to run the plant, but he was rebuffed. Even though they would be city employees, that number, too, was considered a competitive matter.   Closing Boeing loophole Until recently, Texas law was clear on the status of contract documents once bidding has ended and the contract is signed. Government contracts can be made available for public inspection. In addition, state law was clear that environmental impact information was not considered a competitive matter and had to be disclosed. That changed after the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in the Boeing case in June 2015. According to the Texas Tribune, secret deals emanating from the Boeing decision run the gamut. A Kaufman County school district kept secret the terms for a food service deal. The city of Houston won’t reveal how many permits it had issued to Uber drivers. And the city of McAllen didn’t have to say how much it paid Enrique Iglesias to sing at a holiday parade. Whether DME’s secret contract terms, ostensibly allowed by the Boeing decision, circumvent federal law by withholding environmental information is not clear. Williams said he knew that information would not typically have been redacted. Members of the Texas Legislature have already filed bills to close what critics call the “massive loopholes” created by the Boeing decision. In a press conference this week, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed two bills in each chamber to address the problems. One pair of bills, House Bill 792 and Senate Bill 407, would limit the threshold governments can use to withhold information when considering competitive matters. In addition, the legislation restores the biggest loss from the Boeing decision: Once a contract is finalized, it once again would become a public document. Another set of bills, House Bill 793 and Senate Bill 408, would make sure that private entities that receive public funds are subject to open records laws under certain circumstances. The next session of the Texas Legislature begins Tuesday.

Boeing deliveries to ME carriers up 15pc in 2016 SEATTLE, 7 days ago Boeing delivered a total of 60 commercial aircraft to Middle Eastern carriers in 2016, as against 52 in the previous year, marking a rise of 15.3 per cent, with Emirates heading the list having received 16 planes, the US manufacturer said. Qatar Airways took the second position with 11 deliveries in 2016, while Flydubai received eight aircraft. Globally, Boeing recorded strong commercial delivery numbers during the year and achieved several airplane programme milestones. The company delivered 748 commercial airplanes. Boeing booked 668 net orders, valued at $94.1 billion at list prices. The backlog at the end of the year stood at 5,715 unfilled commercial orders. Airplane development programems continued to make progress in 2016. Key milestones for the year included the first flight of the 737 MAX, the opening of the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, Wash., and start of 787-10 final assembly in North Charleston in the US state of South Carolina. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Qatar Airways | Boeing | 2016 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Jannah Burj Al Sarab launches exclusive IDEX room package Over 860 hotels under construction in MEA Air France launches B787 flights to Cairo German flight from Oman makes emergency landing in Kuwait Sheraton Amman Al Nabil honours partners, SPG Pro Members Ajman tourism receives top recognition Exclusive 'His' and 'Her' packages at Saray Spa Marriott Al Forsan, Abu Dhabi appoints executive team Tawasy Group ventures into fine dining segment Qatar Airways to launch Las Vegas flights Emirates to launch daily flights to Croatia Boeing, SpiceJet in $22bn deal for 205 planes Alison Nelson’s Chocolate Bar opens in Bahrain Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Dubai sees good year ahead Turkish Airlines plans flights to Ukrainian city Global Jet Centre launches new website KHC announces Flynas’ $8.6bn deal with Airbus Mosaid Travel selects Sabre to personalise travel offerings Jumeirah Zabeel Saray offers Super Brunch AccorHotels Egypt join charitable initiative Middle East passenger traffic up 12pc in November Tickets launched for Bride shows in Dubai, Abu Dhabi Iran Air takes delivery of its first Airbus A321 Airbus achieves record 688 aircraft deliveries Shop Qatar takes festivities to Doha Corniche Dubai RTA in deal with Uber to deploy 14,000 cars Ritz-Carlton Dubai unveils new activities Seafood Market to celebrate 24 years of success Kite Festival on Anantara Sir Bani Yas Island on Feb 3 Qatar Airways Holidays offers great packages Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total means the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company is likely to have beaten European rival Airbus on output. Airbus had forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since December 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21bn at list prices for Boeing's new narrowbody 737 MAX, which is scheduled to enter service next year. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production. The majority are single-aisle 737 planes. Sales of its more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

Her comments were directed at President-elect Donald Trump's remarks about swapping out the Lockheed Martin fighter jet for cheaper models, notably Boeing's F/A-18. © AP Photo/ Paul Beaty Boeing CEO Promises Trump Air Force One Will Be Less Than $4B The Air Force needs the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the A-10 Warthog, two polarizing but indispensable planes, she told Defense News. "The Air Force does not view the F/A-18 and the F-35 to be substitutable at all," she said. "They fulfill different requirements." Trump in December tweeted, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" That would be comparing "apples and oranges," James told an Air Force Association breakfast, Defense One reported. "It does not fulfill the same requirements," she said about the older F/A-18. "It's a very fine fourth-generation fighter. The F-35 is an extremely fine fifth-generation fighter…It's a cut above anything the pilots have seen before and we need it and we want it in the inventory." © Flickr/ mashleymorgan Lockheed Martin Awarded $450Mln to Produce F-35 Combat Jets for South Korea Trump has also tweeted about F-35 costs being "out of control." The program, which has been criticized on both sides of the aisle for delays, cost overruns and performance failures, is expected to cost $400 billion over the next few years, more than double the initial estimate. This makes it the Pentagon's most expensive program, CNN Money pointed out. Trump's tweets are viewed as negotiating tactics intended to get both of the massive munitions manufacturers to offer better deals. Trump has said he intends to negotiate directly with Boeing on the costs of operating Air Force One, for example. But as far as the Air Force is concerned, the F-35s are "crucial" and "performing magnificently," according to James. "The leaders of the Air Force will have the opportunity when the time comes to advise the president-elect on this," James told Defense News. "But based on everything I know, the two are not interchangeable and the Air Force has not expressed interest in the F/A-18s." She also defended postponing the retirement of the A-10 Warthog, an aging plane that has been subject to sunsetting suggestions for the past two years. Its fortunes have been saved by the need for slow, low-flying planes that can withstand ground fire to support troops. © Flickr/ Dmitry Terekhov Russian Su-35 May be Last Fighter Jet Imported by China as Beijing Bets on Homemade J-20 "Our feeling about the A-10 is that we would suggest certainly delaying the retirement," James said, according to Defense One. "It's been extremely helpful in the fight overseas against [Daesh] as well as for presence in the Pacific and in Europe." The Air Force has said budget constraints led to its original plan to retire the A-10. Eventually, it and other old planes will have to be grounded to free up funding for new projects, James said.

It could be modernized in it's role ONLY. without POTATO PEELERS. The F35 have different functions and should be good at it. And NOT many countries have capabilities against an F 35. Mostly those that can try something are U.S PUPPETS that MUST do as they told. But yes. Eliminating some costs is good. The SILENT F15 could compare in many areas with the F 35. Of course NOT remotely in many areas. But could play a good alternative, while the F35 is real ready. Giving F35 to Israel was a GIANT STUPIDITY. NO ONE but maybe IRAN and Russia can challenge it. Unfortunately the MESS against Russia is all to get TRUMP to be enemy of Russia. Now CLINTON is completely out of the W.H equation. And about the PLAN to challenge TRUMP at congress, be ready for disappointments. He NO POLITICIAN, and is NOT against congress. But have an ARMY of advisers about how to tackle it. Best be ready for NEGOTIATIONS. But TRUMP is RIGHT!! That plane is TOO expensive. I'll probe it against a flu of misappropriations,. I mean, it goes UP yearly!!! ONLY Obama;s FORMULA to calculate COLA said there was no inflation. Otherwise, F 35 costs should be as high as 6 years AGO.

But does China have the new 'S' variant they are entirely two different planes if China reversed engineered the latest variant they would have a world beater that US could not produce under 100 million. The big questions is do they have the 'S' variant? which has a newly developed engine and the latest 6th gen avionics and sensors plus stealth modifications and coatings on plane. As far as i'm aware Russia was to supply a small batch with mixed specs and strict conditions subject to massive penalties for licensing infringement. Reply support 09:28 08.01.2017 | -1 | Edit | Delete Politics aside, IMO the programme can be retrieved and put back into the black all the way around if, as with the WW 2 era F4U Corsair carrier aircraft programme and the equally troublesome Phantom II F4D programme, eight things are done: 1. Kick out the "innovators" through what is known as locking in or freezing the design then conduct changeover of engineering staff to reliability and QC/QA reliability engineers; 2. Re-source the project "bridge money" (cash on hand used to finance building the prototypes and production units to cover the time from order to the time of completion and subsequent billing) thereby kicking the moneychangers out of the government procurement temple. The US taxpayer is paying for the project money through using bank financing close to four times over in interest and flotation fees; 3. As with the Osprey and other aviation and othe rnaval power plant projects, switch over to marinized Rolls Royce power plants from Pratt & Whitney and/or GE; 4. On corrective action procedures for sorting out defective design elements, break that function down into small teams who all are accountable to one perpetually angry person (at Hughes Aircraft Tucson, it was the Man In Black whose name you need not know but he got the job done) Every Russian aviation and military contractor performs their work under th einfluence of one person and the company bears that person's name. This is but one of those reasons why it is done that way. Personalized design bureaus work through giving the workers a focus in the same way churches strengthen through having popes. bishops and Grand Metropolitans; 5. End sole sourcing of anything. Always put procurement out for competitive bid; and 6. The government should always own free an dclear the final design of the aircraft not the vendor. 7. Penalties for test pilot deaths owing to design flaws are not enforced. They must be or no one will take the Feds seriously. Wives of test pilots do not want money in lieu of their husbands, they want their husbands alive or at least justice if their husbands are murdered by negligent design. 8. DCAS and DCAA should be re-consolidated back into one auditing agency, the Defense Contract Audit Systems Management Agency. It worked, it was nimble, it was agile, cost-controlling, responsive and for the most part met all programme goals, whatever project it took on. Making two separate agencies out of one was and is a complete failure in this instance and is the prime source of unsupervised "Why did we do that?" types of design and manufacturing errors. The above is how the F4U Corsair and the Phantom II F4D were sorted out, also AMRAAM, TV Maverick, the Harpoon and the Patriot missle's safe-arm device problems. The real problem is that there is no such degree'd discipline called "military engineering financial history & administrative history" IMO. Reply ivanwa88 09:32 08.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete What F-35 is supposed to do is link with Aegis radar and missiles to give particularly smaller nations capability to wage a major missile attack from Aegis anywhere within range whether from land sea or air utilizing any missile firing facility in NATO. That's what she really means which is a highly politicized position for her to take she is in essence batting for NATO. Incidentally a new promo video was released last week with these features mentioned in detail. So it will really come down to whether Trump wants to support NATO in what would be a irreversibly powerful position over the world and once smaller nations have this power can it be controlled for world peace and a multi power sharing or will it serve only NATO aligned nations against the rest meaning we are back to square one and WW3 will be between the 23 NATO aligned nations and the rest of the world? Trump must scrap this plane. Reply megargy 10:32 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete James is just protecting her future salary ! Reply support 10:56 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete As an hilarious aside, how Hughes Aircraft financed its purchase orders was by using their own money so that they could directly pocket the interest earned at the allowable prime rate. Their financial clout came from residuals from RKO Pictures, patents and proprietary intellectual property licenced out under trademark law, Hughes Tool diamond-tipped oil well drillhead sales, and other in-house resources. Also, like Chrysler and others, they asked for no money from the Feds suring WW 2 but only the right to call in the debt owed to them by the Federal government at some future date. Hughes Aircraft did not have to call in that marker until the Feds busted up Hughes Medical into a separate non-ownership vehicle in the mid-1980's. In effect, Hughes war production was a money-losing but necessary tax write-off so that Hughes could pocket their earnings from other industries. Lockheed needs to change their business model and become a bit more syncretic in their structure. Maybe they should buy Lionsgate Studios lol It is always stupid to finance purchase orders using othe rpeople's money unless you use a factor charging a one-time 7 points of simple interest. The financial company ends up owning your manufacturing plant which they will then crash into a few trees at high speed then sell off the scrap parts to competitors for cash. That is what is happening to Lockheed. This has already happened to General Electric. I hope all of Jeff Immelt's engineers quit to work for Siemens, Doosan Babcock, Rolls Royce and Magellan Aerospace. Canada, the UK, France and Germany are more pro-American than General Electric of Schenectady, NY.

The US aerospace major delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 per cent in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth us$94.1bn at list prices, it said. Boeing’s archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial aircraft deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing’s most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company last week announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25bn, from General Electric’s aircraft leasing arm. However, deliveries of the famous 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. * AFP business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Embraer on flight path to strong fourth-quarter results Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Lockheed assures Trump it will cut F-35 fighter jet costs Air France-KLM chief sees storm clouds ahead for airline MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Oil and gas has itself to blame if millennials are not prepared to work in the industry Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Exclusive: Rockford airport courts Norwegian Air for European flights Saturday Jan 7, 2017 at 8:00 AM Jan 7, 2017 at 11:03 PM Isaac Guerrero Staff writer @isaac_rrs ROCKFORD — Call it a first date with potential: fast-growing, low-cost Norwegian Air flew its first charter flight Friday from Chicago Rockford International Airport to Cancun. Airport officials have courted the Oslo-based airline for three years and hope its executives will choose Rockford as part of its aggressive plan to expand trans-Atlantic routes. Norwegian Air is under contract to operate Apple Vacation charter flights through the end of April from Rockford to Cancun, Mexico; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. The company's bigger play will happen this summer. It has promised to increase its own flights between London and several U.S. destinations, including Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Los Angeles; New York City; and Oakland-San Francisco, California. The company also plans to expand its presence in the Midwest, though it hasn't said where or when it will do so. Worried that Norwegian Air's low-cost business model would stiffen competition, the U.S. airlines and aviation labor unions on both sides of the Atlantic for three years protested the company's bid for a foreign air carrier permit that would pave the way for its U.S. expansion. The federal permit for Norwegian Air's Ireland-based subsidiary was approved late last year. The company is spending significant sums to update its fleet with new, modern aircraft like Boeing's 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. And because fuel is typically an airline's biggest expense, Norwegian Air believes its lighter, gas-sipping planes will allow it to offer the type of low-priced fares that it teased in late December: tickets for summer 2017 flights as low as 56 pounds — that's $69 — from London to New York. The modern planes that Norwegian Air is buying feature wider aisles, more comfortable seating and wireless internet service; Norwegian Air offers free Wi-Fi on most of its flights in Europe and on flights between the U.S. and Caribbean. All of that bodes well as the company is poised to make a big push for the U.S. leisure travel market, said J.T. Bjorge, a base captain who has flown for Norwegian Air for 10 years. Bjorge was at the Rockford airport Friday to oversee the company's inaugural RFD charter flight for Apple Vacations. “One of the questions we have always asked is why is the cost from New York to London (is) three to four times what it is to fly from New York to Los Angeles? Because it's not three to four times the distance,” he said. “It's because there's a monopoly. “The biggest expense today for an airline is fuel, and it's expensive to be poor. What you want to have is new fleets and modern airplanes that are fuel efficient so you can compete.” Rockford's airport is a good match for a low-cost trans-Atlantic carrier like Norwegian Air, said Ken Ryan, the airport's director of business development and cargo. The airport has runways long and wide enough to accommodate any aircraft. And looming nearly 10-stories above the airport's midfield is a new, $40 million maintenance, repair and overhaul facility with two bays, each large enough to accommodate the biggest wide-body aircraft that flies today — exactly the kind of planes that Norwegian Air is adding to its fleet. Wood Dale-based AAR Corp. is operating the airport's jet repair hub and is on the hunt for customers. CEO David Storch told the Rockford Register Star in December that Norwegian Air is among his company's prospects. Storch was there when Airport Director Mike Dunn assembled a large local delegation that flew to Washington, D.C., in 2014 to meet Norwegian Air CEO Bjørn Kjos in U.S. Sen Dick Durbin's office in the Capitol. Dunn presented Kjos with the first-ever “Rockford Award.” The shiny, oblong trophy was meant to thank the airline for buying Boeing planes and thus supporting the Rockford region's aerospace cluster, an important link in Boeing's supply chain. The courtship continues, Ryan said. The airport has long marketed itself as a hassle-free alternative to Chicago's busy O'Hare International Airport. Free parking outside the passenger terminal, which is undergoing a $20 million expansion, doesn't hurt either, Ryan said. “From a strategic point of view, our airport works well for exactly the type of low-cost international airliner that is Norwegian Air,” Ryan said. “When you look at the type of trans-Atlantic fares that they are talking about, we feel there's no doubt that a large number of people would drive many, many miles to Rockford to take advantage of that pricing.” Isaac Guerrero: 815-987-1361; iguerrero@rrstar.com; @isaac_rrs Norwegian Air Norwegian is the world’s sixth largest low-cost airline and carried 30 million passengers in 2016. The Oslo-based company employs 6,000 people and operates 450 routes, including 40 nonstop routes from the U.S. to London, Paris, Scandinavia and the Caribbean. Norwegian has a fleet of 120 aircraft, with an average age of 3.6 years, making it one of the world’s youngest fleets. The company was named the World’s Best Low-Cost Long-Haul Airline by SkyTrax World Airline Awards in 2015 and 2016. Norwegian Air flew almost 30 million passengers in 2016, 3.6 million more than the previous year. Also last year, the company took delivery of 21 new aircraft and launched 34 additional routes, mainly in the U.S., Spain and the United Kingdom.

Besides, the carrier also announced heavily discounted fares, starting at Rs 15,000 for travel in first class of its Queen of the Skies (Boeing 747) flights to the two cities till January 15, a release said. The revised check-in baggage limit is effective from tomorrow, it said. Air India had commenced the 423 seater Boeing 747 services between New Delhi and Mumbai early last month. At present, Air India allows 25kg in economy class and 35kg in business class of free check-in baggage on its flights, which has now been increased to 40 kg and 50 kg, respectively, on Boeing 747 Delhi- Mumbai service, the airline said in the release. As against this, private carriers allow only 15 kg of free baggage to passengers across their domestic flights. "Following its successful decision to deploy the iconic Boeing 747 on Delhi-Mumbai route from December 13 last year, Air India will now allow up to 40kg and 50kg of free check-in baggage for both economy and business class passengers on these flights," it said. Air India is the only carrier to operate the 423 seater, four engine jumbo jet B747, on this busiest route (Delhi-Mumbai) of the country, the release said adding the aircraft offers a premium value to passengers with the most private and exclusive accommodation in the sky with 12 First class seats on the upper deck of the aircraft, 26 seats in business, and the rest 385 in economy.

The transaction, which would more than double SpiceJet’s 49-plane fleet, may be closed within weeks after lengthy talks that pitted Boeing against rival Airbus Group SE, people with direct knowledge of the decision said. The deal includes firm orders for at least 50 of Boeing’s 737 Max, and renegotiated terms for 42 of the single-aisle jets that SpiceJet originally ordered in 2014, said the people. The 92 Max jets would be valued at about $10.1 billion at current list prices, before the discounts that are customary for large purchases. The order would be a record for SpiceJet, which was forced to shut down operations for a day two years ago after it ran out of money, prompting co-founder Ajay Singh to bail out the low-cost carrier. The airline may boost the total if final talks yield bigger discounts and favorable maintenance contracts, one of the people said. Boeing would gain a stronger toehold in India, where Airbus dominates narrow-body fleets after a string of order victories. IndiGo, Go Airlines India and the local unit of AirAsia all fly variants of the Airbus A320. “We expect to complete these negotiations and place the order this financial year,” the airline said in an emailed statement. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. The order would help SpiceJet, India’s second-biggest budget carrier, compete with market leader IndiGo, which has ordered hundreds of Airbus jets to tap surging air-travel demand from a fast-growing middle class.

Boeing's deliveries, orders fell in 2016 Money Friday 6 January 2017 - 10:47pm FILE: Boeing's most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. Photo: Wikimedia Commons NEW YORK - Boeing said Friday its deliveries of commercial planes fell modestly in 2016 and it saw fewer orders compared to 2015. The US aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015.  Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth R1.2 trillion at list prices, it said. Boeing's archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing's most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders.  The company on Wednesday announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25 billion, from General Electric's airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. Shares of Boeing rose 0.1 percent to $158.87 in afternoon trading. AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The painting he carries is titled “Roscoe Brown.” The painting sitting against the wall at left is “The Flyer of the 332nd.” (Dan Bates / The Herald) New exhibit showcases historic airmen and planes Gale Fiege Wed Jan 4th, 2017 12:26pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Aviation buffs are in for a treat this week with the opening of a new exhibition at the Schack Art Center. Retired Boeing designer Robert Parks has combined his life’s work with his artistic passion to offer an exhibit in the Schack’s loft gallery — Historic Aircraft Profiles — which includes dozens of colorful and detailed drawings and paintings of planes. Displayed in the main gallery will be more than 50 paintings by Everett artist Chris Hopkins from his series on the famed Tuskegee Airmen. The Schack’s show — “Red Tails, Silver Wings” — opens with a reception from 5 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the art center, 2921 Hoyt Ave. Admission is free. Parks, 90, of Shoreline, will be on hand to talk about his time in the Army Air Forces during World War II, his long career with Boeing and his lifelong interest in aviation. Parks’ name is on the Wall of Honor at the National Air and Space Museum at the Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport for his contributions to aviation. Hopkins, 63, also an Air Force veteran, began his Tuskegee project as part of the Air Force Art Program. A number of paintings from the series are hung permanently in the Pentagon. The paintings illustrate the heroism and ground-breaking work of the country’s first African-American military pilots. “Black Aviation through World War II” is the title of a lecture at the Schack to be presented at 7 p.m. Friday by Hopkins and his friend and fellow Air Force vet Guy E. Franklin, who has written extensively about the Tuskegee Airmen. The lecture is open to the public, with a suggested donation of $5 at the door.

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT Hey, what about the Oreo? During the campaign, Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand, was one of the companies that President-elect Donald Trump railed against for sending jobs overseas, alongside the likes of Ford, Carrier and Boeing. But while those other three have already had post-election run-ins with Trump in one fashion or another -- triggering wild stock gyrations and corporate pledges to rework investment plans -- Mondelez curiously has not. Given the president-elect’s current tweeting pace, it feels like it’s just a matter of time before the company comes back under scrutiny. Mondelez wasn’t interested in discussing its game plan for when that moment comes, but experts said it undoubtedly has scrambled to prepare a rapid-fire response. “The last thing they want to do is have a brand out there being attacked,” said Richard Frisch, a crisis-communications consultant. “There’s no question they have a crisis plan in place.” The stakes are high. Last month, when Trump wrote on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 program were “out of control,” shares of defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. tanked, wiping out almost $2 billion in market share. “We’ve never had a president-elect who could move stocks at will,” said Richard Levick, founder of the communications firm that bears his name. “A Trump tweet rates among the top risks of the year.” ‘Never Eat’ When a company makes nice, on the other hand, it can be rewarded. Ford Motor Co.’s stock rose nearly 4 percent after it announced it was canceling a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mondelez first drew Trump’s ire back in August 2015, when he claimed that the company was eliminating 1,200 jobs in the U.S. as it moved Oreo production to Mexico. “I’ll never eat them again,” Trump vowed. His assertion wasn’t quite true. The global snack giant had decided to invest $130 million in an existing plant south of the border to upgrade cookie and cracker production, rather than putting the money into a factory in Chicago. The move eliminated approximately 600 positions. Stephen Colbert Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton soon jumped on, too, and The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert mocked Trump’s vow not to eat Oreos by shoveling them into his mouth one night. But the controversy eventually faded into the background. Mondelez, which generates more than 70 percent of its revenue outside North America, said it has invested about $450 million in U.S. manufacturing facilities since 2012, when the company split from Kraft Foods. The company still produces Oreos, the world’s top-selling cookie, at three domestic facilities. “We continue to make investments where it makes sense and that includes the United States,” said Laurie Guzzinati, a spokeswoman for the Deerfield, Illinois-based snack maker. She said the company hasn’t heard from the incoming administration. Mondelez might be better positioned than, say, Boeing Co. or Ford, to resist the pressure of a Trump tweet. It isn’t a big government contractor -- making planes for the military, for instance -- and getting consumers to boycott a favorite snack is difficult. That could weaken Trump’s ability to have a lasting negative impact on the $26.5 billion company, according to Frisch. Still, that may be little comfort. Large food companies tend to be conservative, perpetually seeking to stay away from controversy, particularly of the political variety. And in this unprecedented atmosphere, where the next squabble with the federal government is seemingly just a click away, Mondelez executives are hoping to avoid the glare of Trump’s aggressive Twitter persona. “If you’re Mondelez,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, “the last thing you want is to be a target of Donald Trump." ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Boeing’s first 737 MAX jet makes its way through the production line at the Renton assembly plant. Most of the orders that Boeing booked in 2016 were for 737 jets. (Boeing Photo) The Boeing Co. says it delivered 748 commercial jets last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft, including a burst of 202 orders in December. As furious as that pace was, it didn’t quite match Boeing’s performance in 2015 or analysts’ year-end expectations for 2016. Nevertheless, the count seems likely to leave Boeing ahead of its European rival, Airbus, which is due to report its final 2016 figures next week. Boeing’s tally doesn’t include its multibillion-dollar sale to Iran, which is still contingent on financing, but it does take 180 canceled orders into account. The company said its order backlog remains at roughly seven years’ worth of production at current rates. Most of last year’s orders were for single-aisle 737 jets, which says as much about the softness in the market for wide-body planes as it does about the appeal of Boeing’s next-generation, fuel-efficient 737 MAX. That market softness, plus the drive to compete with Airbus, led Boeing Commercial Airplanes to reduce its workforce by about 8 percent in 2016, with more reductions to come in 2017. The sales trend suggests a cloudier outlook for operations in Everett, where Boeing’s wide-body jets are made, than for the plant in Renton where 737s are assembled. In November, Boeing named GE executive Kevin McAllister to become president and CEO of the commercial airplane division, transitioning into the post held by Ray Conner. Today, McAllister sent a message to employees recapping the past year and looking ahead to the next year’s challenges. Here’s the full text of the message: “Thanks to the efforts of the entire Commercial Airplanes team, we finished 2016 strong. In December alone we delivered 67 airplanes and won 202 net orders. Overall we delivered 748 airplanes and won 668 net orders for the year. “During the holiday break I had the chance to visit employees in Everett working to deliver 777s. It was truly inspiring to see firsthand the dedication and passion our employees have to get airplanes into the hands of our airline customers. I also want to send huge kudos to the Seattle Delivery Center team and the teams at our other sites for their outstanding performance in helping us meet our delivery commitments. “While orders and deliveries are a big part of the story, BCA achieved a number of key milestones in 2016, including the first flight of the 737 MAX, the beginning of final assembly on the new 787-10 Dreamliner, the opening of the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, the delivery of the 500th 787 Dreamliner and the debut of the 737 MAX at the Farnborough Airshow. “In addition to visiting several of our BCA sites in December, I’ve also been listening to our airline customers. Their expectations are very clear: They are depending on Commercial Airplanes to continue to execute on every part of our strategy to operate faster and more efficiently, remain steps ahead of the competition, provide superior value at a competitive price and deliver on our commitments. “This year we will focus on differentiating our value with our customers, delivering on our operational and financial commitments, and focusing on meeting our plan so we can continue to invest in new products, develop the team and build a strong One Boeing culture. We’re also looking forward to the first 737 MAX 8 delivery, as well as the rollout and first flight of both the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10. “Seeing BCA from the outside, as I have over many years, is impressive. Seeing BCA from the inside, up close as a new member of the team, is incredible. In the coming weeks and months I’ll continue to listen, learn and hopefully meet more of you as I travel around the company. I also look forward to continuing to work with Ray and seeking his advice and counsel as we face the challenges and opportunities 2017 will bring. “I’m excited to begin this year with you and to be part of this amazing team.” Finally, here’s the rundown on 2016 deliveries and orders by airplane type: 737s: 701 gross orders, 550 net orders, 490 deliveries, 4,452 unfilled orders. 747s: 18 gross orders, 17 net orders, 9 deliveries, 28 unfilled orders. 767s: 26 gross orders, 26 net orders, 13 deliveries, 93 unfilled orders. 777s: 23 gross orders, 17 net orders, 99 deliveries, 442 unfilled orders. 787s: 80 gross orders, 58 net orders, 137 deliveries, 700 unfilled orders. Total: 848 gross orders, 668 net orders, 748 deliveries, 5,715 unfilled orders.

No one was injured, but the incident again raises concerns about the possibility of collisions between commercial aircraft and drones—a topic that in the United States continues to rankle both the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), who are adamant about public safety (and keeping control of the skies) and the enormously large drone hobbyist community, who are keen on flying their beloved robots in the sky the way they enjoy. The Linhas Aereas de Mocambique (LAM) jet was on a routine domestic flight from the capital Maputo, in the south, to Tete, in the Northwest near Malawi. As the aircraft approached the runway in Tete, the pilots reported hearing a loud bang on the front of the plane. According to the Aviation Herald, no abnormalities followed, so the crew—believing it to be a bird strike—continued to proceed with the landing. After the passenger jet was on the ground and its 80 passengers disembarked, authorities examined the damage and concluded that the crumpled side of the nose cone was in fact caused by a drone. The damaged Boeing aircraft is currently under repair and a replacement one was sent to Tete to perform the return flight to Maputo. What type of drone caused the damage, or who was piloting it is still unclear. Surprisingly, this is only the second recorded occurrence of a drone colliding with a passenger aircraft. The other happened in April 2016, when a British Airways Airbus A320 collided with a drone around Heathrow Airport in London as it was flying in from Geneva. As with the most recent incident in Mozambique, however, no was was hurt. Despite the lack of injuries and few collisions, there have been plenty of near-misses and airports across the U.S. regularly report incidents with drones flying in or around the port’s airspace. For example, in a five-month period from August 2015 to January 2016, the FAA received 582 reports of drones in what it considers to be dangerous flying areas. That is an average of 116 a month. Deep confusion has swirled around drone regulations for a number of years in the U.S. with the commercial drone and hobby pilots flying under little or heavy handed supervision, depending, and the FAA stalling to release a report of rules and regulations on the matter until just this past June. When a drone operator was charged for dangerous flying behavior, it was under the careless and reckless distinctions used for large scale aircraft.

Flight TM136 departed from Maputo at 1535 local time on Jan. 5 and was scheduled to arrive at Tete in north west Mozambique at 1715. There were 80 passengers and six crew members on board at the time of the incident. In a statement, LAM said the aircraft was on approach to Tete when the crew heard a loud noise, suggesting a collision with a foreign object. The aircraft landed normally; a follow-up ground inspection revealed that the aircraft’s nose had been damaged. Photographs posted to social media show several serious dents and tears to the right-hand side of the 737-700’s nose cone. There is no obvious bird debris on the aircraft and unconfirmed media reports suggest the aircraft could have collided with a drone, although this has not been substantiated by ATW. LAM reported the incident to the Mozambique authorities and the aircraft has since been grounded, causing some disruption to LAM’s operations. A Boeing spokesman said it far too early to give a comment, as too little information is currently available. Drone regulation has become a high-priority topic over recent months after several near misses with commercial aircraft in 2016.

Jet2 has now ordered a further four Boeing 737-800NG jets at a cost of more than £300 million which is in addition to the 30 aircraft the airline ordered from Boeing earlier this year, bringing the total number to 34. So far, Jet2 has taken delivery of eight of those aircraft and the extra four is set to be delivered between August, 2018 and January, 2019. Jet2 has been expanding rapidly in recent years and has enjoyed good growth particularly at East Midlands Airport Steve Heapy, chief executive of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said: "This is the next exciting phase in our ongoing growth. These four new aircraft will further increase our fleet size, allowing us to offer even more flights and holidays to top European destinations.

Trump in recent days has used Twitter to issue edicts to General Motors and Toyota about where to build their cars. He has claimed at least some credit for Ford’s turnabout on building another plant in Mexico and Sprint’s pledge to create or bring to America 5,000 jobs. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 On Twitter, he also has gone after air conditioner maker Carrier, industrial parts maker Rexnord and aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The bully pulpit of the presidency historically comes with the White House, but some are questioning what they see as Trump’s early and capricious use of it. He has targeted specific companies and put boardrooms everywhere on notice: Trump’s watching and ready to call out malefactors as he sees them. “This is a very new way of governing,” said Diane Lim, a public policy economist at The Conference Board, who stressed she was not speaking for the business organization. “Presidents usually don’t govern one company at a time. That’s exactly why it’s a very confusing time for companies.” Yep, @JustinWolfers, Trump gives new, more literal meaning to the notion of POTUS having the &quot;bully pulpit&quot; https://t.co/XxgS15jHNE&mdash; Diane Lim (@economistmom) December 7, 2016 Yet some are impressed. “It’s extraordinary what Trump has been able to do, with the jawboning and potentially holding out the possibility of whatever presidential actions he may take,” said Marc Selverstone, chairman of the presidential recordings program at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. “He’s able to move the needle without invoking the levers of formal power.” At any rate, Trump’s maneuvers are stirring unease even within the political right, which includes the conservative minds at Missouri’s Show-Me Institute, a free-market think tank. Patrick Ishmael, director of government accountability in the institute’s Kansas City office, said market forces and consumers should determine whether an enterprise succeeds or fails or decides where to locate. “We’re not for government getting involved and putting its thumb on the scale.” Trump’s public comments have focused on restoring manufacturing jobs within America’s borders, though some in labor harbor doubts about his sincerity in putting workers ahead of big business. So who falls into Trump’s Twitter sights next? What can they do about it? And what difference can 140 characters from @realDonaldTrump make? Historical precedent Prior presidents have used the bully pulpit against business and labor alike. The phrase itself came from President Theodore Roosevelt, noted for breaking up powerful American business trusts early in the 20th century. Roosevelt saw public office as a platform for advocacy and meant the word “bully” to mean outstanding or first-rate. “I suppose my critics will call that preaching, but I have got such a bully pulpit!” the nation’s 26th president declared. A generation later, Harry Truman battled to transition the economy from war to peace in 1946. Labor strikes by railway workers and coal miners, the president believed, most threatened the nation. After efforts to negotiate the disputes had failed, Truman assembled not the media but the Congress on May 25. He already had seized the railroads and asked lawmakers for authority to draft the striking workers into the Army so it could then run the railroads. It worked. In the 1946 equivalent of a news-breaking tweet, Truman received word midspeech that the railway strike had been settled, as he told members of Congress, “on terms proposed by the president.” In April 1962, President John F. Kennedy held a news conference to call out U.S. Steel and other domestic steelmakers. Their public sin was a $6-a-ton hike in steel prices as the nation’s economy recovered and crises brewed in Berlin and Southeast Asia. Privately, Kennedy believed he’d gotten commitments that they wouldn’t raise prices. Kennedy called the simultaneous price increases an “irresponsible defiance of the public interest” and said the executives showed a “ruthless disregard of their public responsibility.” U.S. Steel’s chairman Roger Blough struck back the next day at his own news event. The White House responded by leaking Kennedy’s comments that the steel executives were “sons of bitches,” though that remark was a cleaned up alternative to what the president actually called them, Selverstone said. He said the Kennedy administration took private steps to pressure the executives and companies, and they ultimately rolled back prices. In 1981, Ronald Reagan used his bully pulpit moment to make good on a threat against striking air traffic controllers. He had assembled the media to blast members of the PATCO union, or Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, and read aloud the oath he said each had taken not to strike against the U.S. government. Those who failed to report to work in the next 48 hours will have “forfeited their jobs,” Reagan said. Populist appeal Trump’s bully pulpit moments also feed his populist message. He wants people to cheer him on, and many do. Enough Michigan voters switched loyalties this year to support the Republican Trump, who during the campaign regularly blasted Ford’s plans to build a plant in Mexico. Four years earlier, Michigan voters sided with President Barack Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a native son who nevertheless attacked the Obama-supported bailout of the auto industry. Romney called it “crony capitalism on a grand scale.” Trump’s tactics also excite his supporters who desire a forceful leader able to make change without subjecting proposals to what he calls “the swamp” of Washington as usual. “Politics from the outside looks bad to people who are impatient with the many, many steps that need to be taken to get things done,” said Chris Crandall, a social and political psychologist at the University of Kansas. He added that Twitter is the “perfect” platform for Trump to pressure companies. “Trump lives in the now, and Twitter is all about now,” Crandall said. “And what he says can be discounted to some extent because it’s just Twitter.” Since the November election, public-opinion polls show an uptick in optimism about Trump’s potential to lift the economy. His emphasis on boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs falls in line with a survey released this month in which 48 percent of respondents said it was “very important” that Trump raise the topic in his inaugural speech on Jan. 20. The only issue that Americans ranked higher in the Politico/Morning Consult survey was the need for Trump to speak about “healing the nation.” Still, Trump’s pressure tactics — reflective of the bluntness he showcased in the reality TV series “The Apprentice” — defy how policymaking ought to be carried out in a democracy, with inclusion and careful deliberation, said professor Crandall: “He’s playing a dangerous game.” Labor members largely voted for Trump, but some leaders remain skeptical. “Donald Trump is a dealmaker” capable of helping the big businesses that his tweets deride, said Mike Louis, president of the Missouri AFL-CIO, which represents 183,000 active workers. “He’s for large corporations, and that’s reflected in the billionaire executives he’s picked for his Cabinet. They’re not worker-friendly people.” Other labor groups are withholding judgment on Trump’s support for workers until he takes action as president. “I think it’s too early to tell,” said Joe L. Hudson, political director for the St. Louis-Kansas City Carpenters Regional Council. Bully chill Even if his policies turn out to be good for the economy, Trump’s bully pulpit tweets have cast a chill over how he might treat individual businesses. Since the election, Trump has turned on aircraft maker Boeing over complaints that the next Air Force One was costing too much and threatened, “Cancel order!” Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump challenged Lockheed Martin two weeks later for costs and overruns on a military jet, adding that he had “asked Boeing to price-out” a competing aircraft. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump also has publicly hailed Overland Park-based Sprint and its Tokyo billionaire chairman Masayoshi Son for their pledges to create thousands of jobs in the United States. Some have seen those commitments to the president-elect as a preamble to seeking a controversial merger with T-Mobile. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:45 Deep Background: Automated cars at CES 2017 Pause 3:16 After nearly 50 years in exile, former KC Black Panther leader Pete O'Neal speaks from Africa 0:41 Kansas trooper’s dashcam shows semitrailer losing control on I-70 3:35 KU coach Bill Self on win over Oklahoma State: 'I didn't think it was one of our better games' 15:59 Facebook Live highlights: Terez A.

Trump made the remarks with Masayoshi Son, chairman of Sprint and CEO of SoftBank G The Associated Press Others have questioned whether Trump meaningfully influenced Ford’s decision to change plans that he had criticized. Whether Trump’s hand or agenda made a difference in those decisions, his public involvement has shown business leaders that the rules have changed. Public policy economist Lim said that new uncertainty has caused businesses to delay big decisions. Some also are waiting to see how much of the president-elect’s economic agenda comes to fruition. Her advice to CEOs weighing decisions, especially involving jobs or non-U.S. production, is to be proactive instead of waiting for the next Trump tweet to land. Reach out and bring him into the announcement. It’s late advice for Japanese automaker Toyota, which became Trump’s target on Thursday. He tweeted that Toyota said it would build an assembly plant in Mexico to build Corollas for the U.S. market. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 “NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,” Trump’s post said. The assembly plant in question, in Guanajuato, Mexico, was one that Toyota announced in 2015 for production starting in 2019. Who’s next? The impact Trump’s bully pulpit moments have, or any president’s can have, may depend largely on how critical a company’s decision is to its pocketbook. A decision to locate a manufacturing plant in Mexico or the United States often is a close call, said Chris Kuehl, an economist at Armada Corporate Intelligence in Kansas City, Kan. Labor, transportation, energy, taxes, personnel and other costs all weigh on the outcome. Ford’s decision to scrap plans to build in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, certainly reflected more than political pressure. It wanted to move production of the Focus out of Michigan to the new plant, but sales of the small car have slumped badly. It already had moved the Fusion family sedan production in Michigan to a Fusion plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Ford said last week that it would also move the Focus to Hermosillo. Trump’s praise was for $700 million and 700 jobs Ford said it would bring to the Flat Rock, Mich., plant to build an electric SUV and a hybrid vehicle for commercial ride-hailing operations. Kuehl’s point is that presidential pressure, backed by the threat of a future tariff or other policy action, can make the difference in big-dollar decisions that play out over years. The negative publicity of being singled out for criticism can be bad for business. “If you change that equation a little bit,” Kuehl said, “that’s enough to tip the scales.” I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016 One risk for Trump is picking the wrong battle and confronting a corporate decision whose scales he can’t tip. Failure to follow through would weaken his influence. It also is risky for the president-elect to use a mostly punishment-based approach, rather than favoring a carrot over the stick. Carrier did win some economic incentives with its decision to stay, but repeated threats can carry backlash. “It may end up being a serious misstep by Trump. He’s not making any friends this way,” Kuehl said. Still, there are many potential candidates for future bully pulpit moments. Airlines may consider whether Trump would weigh in on a decision to buy aircraft from U.S.-based manufacturer Boeing or Airbus, the European company that already has a heavy presence at U.S. airports. Orders for smaller aircraft from Brazil’s Embraer or Bombardier in Canada similarly could draw Trump’s attention as both supply the U.S. market, at least partly, from production abroad. Trump’s promised infrastructure spending means ordering a lot of steel for construction projects. That could prompt presidential scrutiny of companies that import girders, rails or other elements for bridges, towers and the like. Kuehl said there’s even a case that Trump could hope to protect coal miners’ jobs by calling out utilities that aggressively pursue alternative energy sources. “It’s a brave new world,” Lim added.

Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company beat European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies.   OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

Where, for instance, is my vision? Where are my dreams? Where, above all, is my house made out of the repurposed wings and tailfin of a Boeing 747 and nestling, in all its effortful whimsicality, in the Santa Monica mountains and providing me with sea views throughout? Said aeronautical pile belonged to Francie, a retired Mercedes-Benz dealer. It looked ridiculous – the Boeing’s wings sat atop a glass and concrete building and screamed: “Look at us! Are we cute enough to kiss or WHAT?” It also cost millions upon millions of dollars (which reminds me – where are my millions?) and required clearance by 17 authorities and the closing of five freeways and a highway patrol escort during construction. But Francie and her architect seem happy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s so lovely!’ … Caroline Quentin and Piers Taylor. Photograph: Jack Dwyer/BBC/Wall to Wall “Actor and passionate property developer” Caroline Quentin and architect Piers Taylor present. She does the feelings, he does the facts. Their conversation goes roughly like this: CQ (gazing round the wood-panelled/poured-concrete/rammed-earth house): “It’s beautiful!” PT (pointing up): “Sun comes in here. And here. It makes it light.” CQ: “It’s so lovely!” PT (pointing down): “This is a floor. Otherwise your feet would have nowhere to go, and that is what we would call Bad Architecture.” I enjoyed it very much. It’s moving wallpaper, basically. Beautiful homes merging perfectly with beautiful landscapes, put together by people with enough style, money and talent to do it properly. Grand Designs on a grander scale – and after the hard bit’s been done and the mess tidied away. I did enjoy Karen and Dave – who had his dream eco-friendly home built deep in the Arizona desert. He reminisced fondly outside with Piers about only having to replant three cacti while, inside, Karen told Caroline how close she came to killing him during the build. She has a look about her that suggests she is still rarely more than one cracked bathroom tile away from doing so. Home is where the willingness to endure your spouse is. If you’re lucky, you get a nice view while you do it.

Posted By: Nithya Nair Published: Saturday, January 7, 2017, 12:23 [IST] Subscribe to GoodReturns A day after announcing its ticket prices at par with AC II of Rajdhani trains, National carrier Air India came out with another lucrative offer for its passengers allowing enhanced free check-in baggage on its jumbo 747 flights operating on the trunk Delhi-Mumbai route. Besides, the carrier also announced heavily discounted fares, starting at Rs 15,000 for travel in first class of its Queen of the Skies (Boeing 747) flights to the two cities till January 15, a release said, PTI reports. After Rajdhani Fares, Air India Offers Enhanced Baggage The revised check-in baggage limit is effective from tomorrow, it said. Air India had commenced the 423 seater Boeing 747 services between New Delhi and Mumbai early last month. At present, Air India allows 25kg in economy class and 35kg in business class of free check-in baggage on its flights, which has now been increased to 40 kg and 50 kg, respectively, on Boeing 747 Delhi- Mumbai service, the airline said in the release. As against this, private carriers allow only 15 kg of free baggage to passengers across their domestic flights. "Following its successful decision to deploy the iconic Boeing 747 on Delhi-Mumbai route from December 13 last year, Air India will now allow up to 40kg and 50kg of free check-in baggage for both economy and business class passengers on these flights," it said. Air India is the only carrier to operate the 423 seater, four-engine jumbo jet B747, on this busiest route (Delhi-Mumbai) of the country, the release said adding the aircraft offers a premium value to passengers with the most private and exclusive accommodation in the sky with 12 First class seats on the upper deck of the aircraft, 26 seats in business, and the rest 385 in economy.

David Wagner Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun J. David Wagner, manager of T. Rowe Price Group's Small-Cap Value Fund, was named 2016's top stock picker by Bloomberg News. J. David Wagner, manager of T. Rowe Price Group's Small-Cap Value Fund, was named 2016's top stock picker by Bloomberg News. (Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Sarah GantzContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun After a tumultuous 2016, Baltimore-area investors and wealth managers say they're preaching diversity for 2017 Boeing's stock tumbled in December after President-elect Donald J. Trump questioned the cost of Air Force One. Markets plummeted overnight on news of his upset election win, then rallied to record-setting levels by the end of the year as investors took stock of his promises to cut regulation and taxes, and raise spending. Earlier this year, Britain's vote to leave the European Union similarly sent shock waves through financial markets. One of the most successful stock pickers in 2016 tuned it all out. T. Rowe Price Group's $9.4 billion Small-Cap Value Fund, managed by J. David Wagner, had a one-year return of just under 30 percent in 2016, beating the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Index, which reported one-year returns of 12 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Wagner's strategy is straightforward: He bets on individual companies. Specifically, very small companies with strong books and low stock prices that are off Wall Street's radar and, as a result, undervalued. The 336 stocks in the fund are almost exclusively U.S. businesses in evergreen industries such as financial services, energy and health care that, even if they've had a rough year, will never go entirely out of style.

The company said it has expanded its U.S. workforce by more than 150,000 people in the last five years. "We're focused on our companies. We don't worry that much about Trump or whether the Fed is going to hike interest rates," said Wagner, a vice president at the Baltimore-based money manager who has overseen the small-cap fund since 2014. "We want to create a portfolio that can be ready for everything, objective and agnostic as events unfold." As investors and wealth managers in the Baltimore-area look ahead to 2017, they say geopolitical events and a new U.S. administration led by a businessman with no governing experience will continue to be leading factors influencing financial markets and shaping investment strategy. To navigate the new year, they'll apply lessons learned from 2016 and its success stories, like Wagner, to maintain a diverse portfolio, focus on the long-term outcome, and try to not freak out when something unexpected happens. Passive investing is no fad, financial experts say Sarah Gantz Passive investment strategies, which aim to match market benchmarks like the Standard & Poor's 500 rather than beating them, have been gaining popularity for years. Easier to manage, such funds typically charge lower fees, which explains part of their appeal to investors. But as the trend accelerates,...

(Sarah Gantz) "It's not that we did anything different," Wagner said of the fund, which launched in 1988. "It's just our style came back into favor." When it comes to Trump's domestic policies, investors and analysts are watching whether he delivers on promises to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending and relax banking regulations, all which could spur economic growth and influence investors, said Dale Horn, a senior vice president of wealth management for UBS who is based in Baltimore. Three areas that stand to benefit the most are financial services and banking, pharmaceuticals and technology, he said. Community banks have struggled under tougher regulations that followed the 2008 financial crisis and could begin to grow again under looser rules, Horn said. If the Republican-led Congress pays less attention to rising drug prices, as some expect, that could bode well for pharmaceutical companies. And Trump's plans to encourage the repatriation of money stashed in foreign countries by U.S. businesses, largely technology companies, could spur investments in and acquisitions of smaller tech firms, he said. Meanwhile, investors may have a more cautious outlook on global markets, as they wait to see what comes of Trump's campaign promises to renegotiate key international trade policies, his comments goading international leaders, and a perceived coziness with Russia. "Whether it's real or not, it's perception, and perception is reality in the markets," Horn said. "Whether he behaves in that manner or not, it's fear and it's a risk." Trump's election wasn't 2016's only market-moving event. Global events, most notably Britain's decision to leave the European Union, also rocked markets last year. Analysts say there are plenty more international events ahead, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's term coming to an end and other shifts in European leadership, and China's rising economic and military power. Some of the uncertainty associated with such events is already priced into international markets, which are more accustomed to upheaval, said Paul Ehrlichman, a managing director and head of global value at ClearBridge Investments, a global investment manager owned by Baltimore-based money management firm Legg Mason. For example, he said, while it took a few months for the waves created by Brexit to settle, markets recovered in less than an hour after Italy's prime minister announced his resignation following a failed attempt to change the country's constitution, a sign foreign investors anticipate and accept higher rates of political turnover in some countries, he said. What's more, signs of growth in Europe, such as lower unemployment, job growth and a rise in manufacturing, provide some balance to the region's political uncertainty, and could make for a fruitful investment environment, Ehrlichman said. "Investors get paid for courage, not comfort," Ehrlichman said. "Uncertainty and opportunity go together, particularly uncertainty related to bad news. If you go into those places, that's where there's money to be made and Europe is one of those places where there's a lot of uncertainty." For Mark A. Johnson, an associate professor of finance at Loyola University Maryland, 2016 illustrated two investing values he tries to impart on his students: diversity and consistency. Johnson teaches students to invest over weeks or months, rather than in one lump sum. "One good workout isn't going to reach your goal," he said, "just as investing a lot of money all at once isn't necessarily going to get you to your goal." Betting exclusively on domestic or international growth, small or large companies, active or passive portfolios isn't a smart strategy, Johnson said. Everyone loses at some point, and diversity helps hedge against losses in one area. Passive investing, or a strategy that relies on funds that aim to mirror benchmark indexes rather that beat them and often have low fees, has been growing in popularity. But actively managed funds have been cutting their fees, and funds like Wagner's at T. Rowe that offer a unique strategy will be the ones that stand out, said Drew Cook, director of investment management for Berman McAleer, a Timonium wealth manager. "What he is showing is we're really going to go to two styles of investing — benchmarking and truly active," Cook said. With 336 stocks, Wagner's fund is invested in more companies than other small-cap funds at T. Rowe, a move the man identified by Bloomberg News as 2016's best stock picker said reduces the risk of investing in very small companies. To further spread the risk, no one company accounts for more than 1.3 percent of the fund's value. Wagner's fund isn't a core holding for Berman McAleer, but it's something Cook offers clients looking to add more risk to their portfolio. Cook, who manages $700 million in assets, likes that the fund is full of diamond-in-the-rough companies that, as he said, "most of us have never even heard of." Cook thinks T. Rowe's distance from Wall Street and Wagner's nose for sniffing out good off-the-radar companies gives the fund an edge on competitors. "He blazes his own trail and deviates from the benchmark," Cook said. At the same time, "that means in the future, there are going to be years he underperforms," Cook said, "and that's OK." sarah.gantz@baltsun.com Copyright © 2017, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Europe Donald Trump European Union Angela Merkel 'Passive' investing is no thrill, but it beats the alternatives Index funds gain in popularity, posing challenges for Legg Mason, T.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 7 January 2017 | MYT 8:10 AM Boeing's 2016 orders lowest since 2010, deliveries hit target SEATTLE: Boeing Co fell 80 planes short of its goal for new orders in 2016, but likely clinched the title of world's biggest planemaker for another year. Boeing on Friday said it delivered 748 jetliners last year and booked net orders for 668 aircraft worth about $94 billion at list prices. Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total likely means the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company beat European rival Airbus on output. Airbus has forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders and deliveries closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. Boeing shares were up about 0.1 percent at $158.86 in mid-day trading. Airlines have slowed their shopping for jets, especially large widebody models, causing Boeing's "book to bill" ratio of new sales to deliveries to fall to its lowest level since 2004. Even so, Boeing's orders fell less than expected, suggesting aggressive sales campaigns at year-end, analysts said. Airbus has a price advantage thanks to the strong U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Boeing's sales team. Looking to 2017, "it's going to be tough for Boeing not to get more aggressive on pricing," said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Boeing's deliveries also slowed as the company began building the new 737 MAX narrowbody at its factory in Renton, Washington. The first MAX planes take longer to assemble than older 737 models, and cannot be delivered until Boeing finishes flight tests and gets government certification. Even so, Boeing delivered two more 737s in the latest quarter than in the same quarter of 2015. "That says something about the production system," said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies. OUTPUT RISING AS SALES SLOW Deliveries likely will rise this year as MAX planes that welled up in inventory are delivered. But the gain will be tempered by a 40 percent cut in production of 777 widebodies. Analysts expect 777 deliveries will fall to 3.5 a month in 2018, from 8.3 currently, as the successor 777X model enters production. "What we'll be interested to hear is whether (Airbus and Boeing) expect orders to continue to decline in 2017 at the same time that they are raising production," said Rob Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. The forecasts are typically released with fourth-quarter results. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since Dec. 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21 billion at list prices for Boeing's 737 MAX. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways. Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production, the majority of which are 737 planes. Sales of more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Airlines You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Travel fair targets expats who holiday locally Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Do we really need to fear China money?

Now there’s an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it’s become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company’s stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company’s F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company’s stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year’s CES tech trade show. [HANDOUT] Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they’ve been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “Tweets really do matter,” Mayer said.

Close share panel Image copyright Boom Image caption The XB-1 supersonic prototype has been nicknamed "Baby Boom" It has been a tough few years for the aviation industry and 2016 proved no different. Carriers had to navigate the collapse in oil prices and multiple plane tragedies including EgyptAir in May and the Chapecoense crash in Colombia, as well as fire-prone Samsung phones. However, it is worth noting that last year was actually one of the safest in modern aviation history. So what does 2017 hold in store? Here are some trends to watch out for. Supersonic passenger planes Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson reportedly tried to buy the Concorde fleet but was rebuffed Remember Concorde? It's been more than a decade since the plane was retired from service. But British billionaire Sir Richard Branson is looking to usher in the age of the supersonic flight once again; and make it affordable to the masses. His company Virgin Galactic is working with US start-up Boom to develop the XB-1, which is being plugged as the world's fastest civil aircraft ever made. Image copyright Boom Image caption Boom is developing Concorde's successor but you'll have to wait until at least 2023 for a flight Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also developing supersonic passenger jets, but Sir Richard is hoping to beat them to the punch. The prototype, nicknamed "Baby Boom", will see its first test flight take place later this year though the first commercial flight of its scaled-up successor is not expected until 2023. It has a cruising speed 10% faster than the Concorde (which flew at more than twice the speed of sound) and is nearly three times the speed of a regular plane. Boom's airliner is designed to carry 40 passengers at a time and fly between London and New York in just three hours and 15 minutes. The price for a flight? A mere £2,500 each way. Continuing profits Oil prices are creeping back upward but airlines are set to remain profitable in 2017. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts the global airline industry will make $29.8bn (£24bn) in 2017, its third straight year of profit. Last year the sector logged a record $35.6bn. "These three years are the best performance in the industry's history, irrespective of the many uncertainties we face," says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. "After many years of hard work in restructuring and re-engineering the business the industry is also more resilient". But the profits won't be evenly spread; the strongest performance is expected to be come from North America, which has seen a wave of airline consolidation in recent years. Ultra long air routes Forget about comparing plane sizes, this year will be focused on route lengths and who can claim the title of world's longest flight operator. Emirates currently holds the crown with the 14,200km (8,820 miles) journey between Dubai and Auckland. That flight takes 16 hours and 5 minutes eastbound and 17h 25m westbound. Its rival Qatar Airways will overtake that in February, when it also launches a non-stop flight from Doha to New Zealand's largest city, covering 14,542km, with a flight time of between 17 and a half hours and 18 and a half hours. In terms of kilometres, the longest route is Air India's Delhi to San Francisco (15,300km) - which now flies over the Pacific Ocean instead of the Atlantic - but because of favourable tailwinds takes only 14 and a half hours. No-frills thrills Image copyright Getty Images Image caption From cars to trains to planes: Asia is the world's fastest-growing travel market Air France plans to launch a new budget carrier in late 2017 serving cities in Asia, followed by routes to the US. The Air-France KLM group already operates the Hop and Transavia budget brands in Europe. Within Europe, Ryanair and Easyjet dominate much of the market, leading many companies to look at the transatlantic route for more profits. Iceland's Wow Air will also be expanding its budget routes to the United States in June 2017. It plans to add four weekly flights via Reykjavik. More space... but at a cost Image copyright Delta Airlines Image caption Delta's new A350s will feature 32 business suites, 48 premium economy seats (pictured) and 226 main cabin economy seats There used to be first class, business class and economy, but for those of us constantly relegated to cattle class there is now an extra twist - premium economy. You're still towards the back of the plane, but you get extra legroom, service and amenities. Later this year, for example, on long-haul international flights on its new Airbus A350s, Delta Air Lines launches what it calls its "Delta Premium Select" option. You get "up to 38in of pitch, up to 19in of width and up to 7in of recline", a branded blanket with pillow and an amenity kit, it promises. The catch? The more expensive tickets are around three times the price of the standard economy fare. Cabin crew chic Image copyright Hawaiian Airlines Image caption Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' uniforms for the first time since 2008 In the post-war air travel boom, the centre aisle was marketed as a runway for glamorous stewardesses. Some carriers are now looking to recapture some of that chic with newly-revamped wardrobes. Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' outfits for the first time since 2008, while Delta has worked with New York designer Zac Posen to update its uniforms. Delta says its 60,000 employees will now be draped in a "wholly re-imagined" mix of colours dubbed "Passport Plum, Cruising Cardinal and Groundspeed Graphite". Which sounds more glamorous than just calling them purple, red or grey.

There’s an app for that The Trigger Finance app has a feature that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators. The Trump trigger is the most popular on the app, says the company. This app will notify you if Trump tweets about a company you're invested in.  (Star file photo)   By Karen TurnerThe Washington Post Sat., Jan. 7, 2017 Trump’s tweets are proving again and again to have the capacity to make significant waves. Now there’s an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it’s become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company’s stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company’s F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company’s stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year’s CES tech trade show. Rachel Mayer, co-founder and chief executive of Trigger Finance, said she’s been hearing “overwhelming” demand from the app’s user base for a Trump tweet notification after his electoral victory in November. “When he tweets, the market moves,” she said by phone. “Our users see this as an investment opportunity and a way for them to manage their portfolio risk.” Article Continued Below Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they’ve been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “Tweets really do matter,” Mayer said. The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Hong) By Marisa Kendall | mkendall@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 7, 2017 at 8:00 am | UPDATED: January 9, 2017 at 12:43 pm LOS ANGELES — The upcoming Snap IPO stands to break records and make billions for investors, but the company’s Southern California neighbors hope it will benefit them in a different way — by shining a spotlight on their flourishing tech industry. The startup community in the Los Angeles area has already spawned success stories like Oculus VR and Dollar Shave Club. Now one of the year’s  most anticipated IPOs could be a defining moment for the region as a major tech destination. Venice-based Snap, which reportedly plans to go public with a $25 billion valuation as early as March, would be the biggest offering of a U.S. tech company since Facebook’s 2012 debut. “Snapchat is really the first Silicon Valley-scale company that’s been created in the L.A. area,” said Mitch Lasky, a partner at Menlo Park-based venture capital firm Benchmark, which invested in the company, “and I think that’s going to have profound implications for the future.” Already executives from Uber and Facebook have defected to Southern California, as Silicon Valley struggles with an exorbitant cost of living and a yawning income gap brought on by fast-growing tech companies competing for highly skilled employees. Several Bay Area startups also have packed up and headed for burgeoning tech hot spots in Los Angeles, Venice and Santa Monica. And industry giants like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Netflix have opened offices in the area — known by some as “Silicon Beach” — hoping to capitalize on the region’s media and entertainment legacy. At least by some metrics, Los Angeles already has surpassed the Bay Area in startup activity. In 2016 the City of Angels ranked as the third-most active city in the U.S. for entrepreneurs — beating both San Francisco and San Jose, according to the nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studied new business creation. That represents an upset from the year before, when Los Angeles came in fourth, right behind San Jose. Companies in the L.A. area pulled in $4.5 billion in funding in 2015 — up 40 percent from 2014, according to the National Venture Capital Association. “More and more I’m finding companies that I’m excited about investing in that are here,” said Mike Jones, co-founder and CEO of Santa Monica-based accelerator Science. “I’m also finding a surprising number of startups that are willing to move here.” Reading this on your iPhone or iPad? Check out our new Apple News app channel here. L.A.-area startups are a unique breed — they tend to focus on content creation instead of gadgets, building services and apps to run on the computers, tablets and smartphones designed by their Silicon Valley neighbors. That has led to a proliferation of Silicon Beach media startups like Fullscreen Media and Zefr, social apps like Snapchat, Tinder and Whisper, and e-commerce companies like Dollar Shave Club and MeUndies. There’s also a thriving virtual reality scene in the area — Oculus VR was based in Irvine before its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook — thanks in part to talent poached from Hollywood’s film and special effects industry. And the region houses a niche of next-generation transportation companies like Hyperloop One and Elon Musk’s SpaceX that are taking a page from Boeing and other aviation companies with a long history in the region. Experts agree the SoCal tech scene, which has seen major growth in the past five years, is on the upswing, and a successful public debut from Snap will help recruit tech talent to the region and prevent existing talent from leaving. And when Snap employees cash out after the IPO, they’ll have the money to launch their own startups or become angel investors. Snap is one of several companies that have eschewed Silicon Valley in recent years. Snap’s founders, who reportedly dreamed up the idea for their disappearing photo app at a Stanford fraternity house, brought the startup to Venice instead of staying in Palo Alto. Startup Soylent, which makes meal replacement drinks popular with techies, moved from the Bay Area to L.A. shortly after it was founded. One noteworthy benefit to living down south: “You’re not socked in by fog,” said Simon Cassels, who surfs every morning before heading into work as chief marketing officer for Santa Monica-based smart doorbell company Ring. While some Silicon Valley cities attempt to curtail new business development — Palo Alto recently capped construction of new office spaces — Los Angeles is courting tech startups. The city offers some startups free and discounted rent for their first year in downtown Los Angeles and provides tax exemptions for small businesses and companies that recently moved to the city. In October the city held the grand opening of its La Kretz Innovation Campus, a 60,000-square-foot, $47 million accelerator for cleantech startups in the Arts District of downtown Los Angeles. The district, a gritty, street-art-covered neighborhood of old warehouses on the eastern edge of downtown L.A., is becoming a hot spot for startups such as Hyperloop One, the company building the high-speed transportation tubes first conceptualized by Tesla’s Musk. The startup’s sprawling industrial complex, which Hyperloop CEO Rob Lloyd described as “an engineer’s dream come true,” has room for offices, an outdoor space to store segments of prototype tubes, and a lab where engineers test the magnets that will make its passenger pods float as they zip through the tubes. It’s the kind of space that’s rare — and costly — in Silicon Valley. “It’s easier for us to do that than any company in San Francisco when there’s 10 times more people demanding space than available space,” Lloyd said. On the western side of Los Angeles, a cluster of abandoned airplane hangars has become a high-tech hub known as Playa Vista. In 2012 YouTube opened its largest “Space” campus there — a facility where YouTubers can film using professional equipment — in eccentric aviation billionaire Howard Hughes’ former private airport and manufacturing facility. Other companies followed, gradually transforming the ghost town into a crowded tech campus. Blocks of gleaming office buildings sprang up, as did a beach volleyball court, hammocks and outdoor couches. Now Google reportedly is opening a facility across the street from YouTube, and Facebook, Yahoo and startups Rubicon Project and Fullscreen Media have offices nearby. “It really feels like this weird ‘Truman Show’ village,” said Christopher Webb, CEO of ChowNow, a startup that builds online ordering systems for restaurants. ChowNow moved into Playa Vista almost two years ago, after outgrowing its office in Venice.  “Everything is so clean and new and perfect.” A look at some Los Angeles area startups — Snap: Venice.

Now there's an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or "triggers," users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it's become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company's stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company's F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company's stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year's CES tech trade show. Rachel Mayer, co-founder and chief executive of Trigger Finance, said she's been hearing "overwhelming" demand from the app's user base for a Trump tweet notification after his electoral victory in November. "When he tweets, the market moves," she said by phone. "Our users see this as an investment opportunity and a way for them to manage their portfolio risk." Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they've been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "Tweets really do matter," Mayer said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(Brendan Smialowski / The New York Times) James Mattis, Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, still lists a modest wood-framed house in Richland, built by the government for Hanford workers, as his residence. He serves on the board of a food bank, stops by the VFW and in November reported for jury duty. Share story By Hal Bernton and David Gutman Seattle Times staff reporters RICHLAND, Benton County — James Mattis, the retired Marine Corps general President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate for defense secretary, came of age in a cloistered community created by the federal government at the dawn of the nuclear age. In this town carved out of the sagebrush lands of Eastern Washington, nearly everyone had a parent working at the nearby Hanford Engineer Works, site of a large-scale nuclear reactor. The atom bomb was the town’s business, and Columbia High School, Mattis’ alma mater, bore a mushroom cloud atop its crest. Mattis graduated in 1968, as a shy, skinny kid whose parents never bought a television and encouraged him to read from a big home library. In a storied Marine career, he emerged as a keen student of history known for compassion and respect for those he commanded, impatience with bureaucracy and a relentless determination to pursue enemy forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. More on Mattis Mattis to continue reporter access to troops in war zones Mattis has called for 2-state solution in Mideast All the while, Mattis has returned home again and again. In recent years, he has spent most of his time at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank in California. But he still lists a modest wood-frame Richland house, built by the government for Hanford workers, as his residence. He serves on the board of a food bank, stops by the VFW, and in November reported for jury duty on a gross-misdemeanor case. “I owe this town a great deal because it gave me the values that allowed me to be where I’m at today,” Mattis told the Richland Rotary Club during a 2011 visit. “It was this town that formed me.” Most Read Stories Michael Bennett explodes at reporter following Seahawks-Falcons game Anti-Trumper John Kasich to doubters: I'm no lame duck Can’t make it to D.C.?

Mattis, at the age of 66, is being drawn back into government service by a man with a strikingly different life experience. Trump grew up in a wealthy corner of Queens, promoted himself through New York gossip columns and reality TV, and lives in a gilded Manhattan penthouse in a skyscraper that bears his name. While Trump has long sought the limelight, Mattis, in a brief interview with The Seattle Times, said he was “kind of brought up more to do the job than attract attention to myself.” If Mattis gets a congressional waiver, exempting him from a law that requires a defense secretary to have been out of the military for at least seven years, the relationship that emerges between Mattis and Trump will be an intriguing subplot in the new administration. In a 2014 interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Mattis said leaders without experience in the military can have an exaggerated view of its power. So he sees himself as duty-bound to offer blunt talk about what the armed forces can and — more importantly — cannot do. Mattis gave Trump an early taste of such counsel in November, according to Trump’s account of their meeting. The retired general said waterboarding, advocated by the president-elect, did not work as well as offering a detainee cigarettes and a beer. The Washington Post reported that, in recent weeks, Mattis has clashed with Trump’s transition team over who will get top jobs in the Defense Department. His views on Israel also could put him at odds with Trump. Mattis, in public remarks, has repeatedly supported a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, has called the two-state solution “an illusion.” Mattis’ willingness to serve was indicated in his speech more than five years ago to the Richland Rotary. Mattis said he would be comfortable with whomever the American people elected as commander in chief, and would strive to carry out that president’s orders. But if ever asked to do something he considered “immoral,” Mattis declared, he “would be back fishing on the Columbia River tomorrow.”   The gym floor at Richland High School, formerly Columbia High School, displays a mosaic of the school’s “Bombers” emblem. (Alan Berner / The Seattle Times)   A tight-knit town apart The Richland of Mattis’ youth was born of a radical intervention by the federal government. In 1943, the Army Corps of Engineers, as part of the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic weapons, took over what was then a rural hamlet of a few hundred people, evicting nearly all the residents. Contractors then moved in to build a boomtown open only to the families of the thousands of men and women working at the secretive Hanford site. The plutonium they made was used in Fat Man, the bomb dropped in 1945 on the Japanese city of Nagasaki that killed more than 70,000 people as World War II drew to a close. After the war, as a new conflict emerged with the Soviet Union, Hanford kept producing plutonium and Richland kept growing with more workers joining the bomb-making effort. Among the recruits was Mattis’ father, John Mattis, who moved his family from Pullman to Richland in the early 1950s to take a job as a power-plant operator at Hanford after a career that had included sea duty as a merchant mariner during World War II. Mattis’ mother, Lucille, was a war veteran, too, having served as an Army intelligence officer based in South Africa. “They had both traveled around the world,” Mattis recalled in the 2014 interview. “They introduced us to a world of great ideas — not a fearful place — but a place to enjoy.” Mattis was drawn to books on geology and the American West, and relished the opportunity to hike, camp and hunt for jack rabbits in the desert around Richland, according to interviews with childhood friends. Most everyone in Richland came from someplace else. But it was a tight-knit town, with residents united by a common pride and purpose in their Hanford work. James Mattis’ 1968 high school senior picture. “Nobody had extended families, so the families that you relied on were neighbors,” recalled Jim Albaugh, a retired CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division and a classmate and childhood friend of Mattis. By the 1960s, Richland had opened to anyone who wanted to take up residence. But Hanford was still the dominant employer, and the town remained largely apart from the decade’s counterculture and Vietnam War protests. As a teenager, Albaugh recalls a life centered on the Spudnut Shop that featured potato-flour doughnuts, the Uptown movie theater and the high school, where Albaugh played on the Bombers basketball team and Mattis was the JV team manager In a class of nearly 600 students, Mattis didn’t rank in the top 10 percent, according to the program from his high school graduation. He was thoughtful and interested, Albaugh said, but “I don’t think anyone would have singled him out for greatness.” And, although Mattis, the never-married Marine, would later gain the nickname “Warrior Monk,” Albaugh says his friend enjoyed high school social life and was no straight arrow. Others recall a kid willing to stand up for the underdog. “I was bullied a lot, but this was one of the … guys who respected me for who I was and what my character was,” said Lloyd Campbell, a high school classmate. After graduation, Mattis went to what is now Central Washington University, where he majored in history and followed his older brother Tom into the Marines as he enrolled in ROTC and obtained a commission as a second lieutenant in 1972. In the 2014 interview, Mattis noted there was a draft back then and little choice about military service. “I don’t think I had the intention of making it a career at that point,” Mattis recalled.   Then-Brig. Gen. James Mattis walks past an honor guard as he arrives at a funeral service in Afghanistan in December 2001. (Dave Martin / EPA)   ‘Have a plan to kill’ Mattis would stick with the Marines for more than 40 years, achieving the rank of four-star general. He joined at the tail end of the Vietnam era, and didn’t face combat, yet he would eventually lead Marines into battle in three other wars. He commanded a battalion in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq in 1991. He led an air-ground assault in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, in the aftermath of 9/11 and a Marine U.S. division during the 2003 Iraq invasion, returning again as the U.S. forces faced a growing uprising in Anbar province. “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet,” was some of the advice Mattis gave his Marines in Iraq, according to author Thomas Ricks. In his book “Fiasco,” Ricks called Mattis one of the U.S. military’s more “intense intellectuals,” who could quote Homer and brought along the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, when he deployed to a war zone. Yet Mattis could also be coarse and profane. While a lieutenant general, talking on a 2005 panel in San Diego, he offered this view of fighting the Taliban: “You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway. So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them …” Those comments stirred controversy for the general who acquired the nickname “Mad Dog” in Iraq and a commander’s admonition to choose his words more carefully. But they did not slow his career. Within two years, Mattis was the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, then chosen to head U.S. Central Command, in charge of all U.S. forces in the Middle East. Retirement, in January 2013, came earlier than expected. Some analysts attributed it to friction with the Obama administration, including Mattis taking a more hostile view of Iran than other high-level officials. Mattis’ perspective on Iran was reflected in his talk to the Richland Rotarians when he pointed to a map of the Middle East and noted the actions of Iranian-backed forces in various locations. “Everywhere you go, you find Iran’s hand …”   James Mattis, fourth from left, at his Columbia High School 45-year class reunion in 2013. The school name was later changed to Richland High School. (Courtesy of Rick Valentine)   ‘Just that kind of guy’ After leaving the military, Mattis deepened his ties to Richland, a city that by then had a population of more than 50,000. Though Hanford in the post-Cold-War-era remains the main employer, the work has shifted from generating plutonium to cleaning up the radioactive waste at the most-polluted nuclear site in America. Mattis put his skills to work on the board of the Tri-Cities Food Bank, which offers groceries to about 1,000 families a week. ValJeanne Meadows, the board president, said she sought out Mattis for the post three years ago, and they connected over shared concerns for their aging mothers. “All moms wish that our sons care about us like that,” Meadows said. “She is just very important to him.” Mattis has been an active board member, asking lots of questions, taking time to unload trucks and distribute food to families. He reaches out in other ways around town, too. At the VFW this fall, he ran into an old childhood friend who served in Vietnam. “He saw me and gave me a big hug,” said Dwight Carey. “He’s just that kind of guy.” Visits home are likely to be less frequent if Mattis takes over at Defense. And some who have enormous respect for him question whether overseeing a massive bureaucracy would play to his strengths. “Budgets, white papers, and service rivalries, not to mention the interagency meetings and White House meddling — these tasks are not what you go to Jim Mattis for,” wrote Erin Simpson, a former assistant professor at the U.S. Marine Command and Staff College, in a commentary. But Albaugh, the former Boeing leader, thinks Mattis would delegate wisely. Albaugh rekindled his childhood friendship with Mattis after the two had an unexpected encounter in the Pentagon in the late 1990s, and he says they “compare notes” whenever they find themselves in the same place. “I think it was a terrific pick,” Albaugh said. Mattis certainly has long pondered one of the most grave questions a defense secretary may confront: When should a country go to war? In the 2014 interview, he said you must start with a clear political goal, and that the costs of a war must be clearly spelled out, regardless of career consequences. “You do what your duty tells you, and let God sort out the rest,” Mattis said. Even as he heads off to Washington, D.C., and his expected new job, Mattis appears to be thinking beyond this next stint of government service to life back in Richland. When he is finished as defense secretary, Mattis told Meadows, he hopes to get back to work for the food bank. Hal Bernton: 206-464-2581 or hbernton@seattletimes.com.

It’s a Chevrolet Suburban. Made in the USA,” Donald Trump told the Detroit News last year when the then presidential hopeful was asked to name his favorite car from his 100-plus vehicle fleet that includes a scissor-door Lamborghini Diablo and a 1956 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. 'Just the beginning': Trump may disrupt 20-year boom for Mexico auto industry Read more For General Motors, Chevy’s owner, it was nice PR, the latest in a series of endorsements from the Trumps that reach back like a stretch limo to the Cadillac Trump’s landlord father Fred used to pick up his rent checks. In the 1980s Donald Trump even worked on building a Trump-branded Cadillac, complete with VCR and paper shredder. The Trumps may be fans of the US’s largest car manufacturer but GM, and the car industry in general, should have been paying more attention to the final sentence of his pre-election endorsement: “Made in the USA.” Trump hit out at the car industry last week like a drive-by shooter, firing off a series of angry tweets about their outsourcing of US jobs. Those tweets will be the hottest topic this week as Detroit’s annual car jamboree, the North American International Auto Show, gets started. It’s a chance for the industry to show off all its latest products and for its executives to address the media about the future. Trump’s blimp-like shadow is overhanging the event as executives and analysts fret about how this overtly interventionist president will use the bully pulpit of his office, and his Twitter account, to try and force a radical change in the way they do business. “Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry, labor and economics group at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Inside Donald Trump’s 1988 Cadillac: the ‘best limo in the world’ had rosewood interiors and was equipped with a fax machine, TV, VCR, paper shredder and built-in safe. Photograph: Jules Annan / Barcroft Images The auto industry matters to the US and to Trump. Six years after a recession that almost destroyed it, the US car industry has made a miraculous recovery. Last week it reported record sales for 2016. Auto manufacturers, suppliers and dealers employ over 1.5 million people and directly contribute to the creation of another 5.7m jobs, according to the CAR. Trump won thanks in large part to states where the auto industry is strongest. The Republican candidate took Michigan, home to the auto show and still the industry’s hub, from the Democrats for the first time since 1988 with a campaign that tore into companies that have sent those voters’ jobs abroad, especially to Mexico. Ford bore the brunt of Trump’s attacks during the election. Last week it was GM’s turn. Then Toyota’s. “General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” the president elect warned via his favorite megaphone, Twitter. Two days later, he was after Toyota. “Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for US. NO WAY! Build plant in US or pay big border tax,” he tweeted. Toyota’s plans were old news but the tweet came on the same day that its president, Akio Toyoda, had told reporters he was keen to work with the president-elect. Auto industry jobs across the US. These were the latest in a series of attacks on major US employers, including Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that have so far brought CEOs running, cap in hand, to Trump Tower to make up for their alleged corporate misdeeds. Shortly after the GM tweet, Ford announced it had canned plans to open a $1.6bn plant in Mexico and would add new jobs building electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. Trump hailed the move: “Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the US. This is just the beginning – much more to follow,” he tweeted. Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book, said Trump was “playing to his base and a lot of the voters who put him in office were industrial midwest, blue collar, union workers. All his tweets and pronouncements have been geared to addressing that audience,” said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for Kelley Blue Book. Ford had already warned that the car industry was expecting a slowdown in sales, especially of smaller vehicles like the ones that would have been built in Mexico. So scrapping the plan makes economic as well as political sense for the company, but market watchers doubt the industry and Trump’s agendas will remain compatible. GM is expected to start laying off more than 3,000 factory workers in Michigan and Ohio, another state that voted for Trump, starting later this month. Will they defend that decision if Trump goes on the attack? The car industry is truly international and China is its largest market. GM and its joint venture partners sold 3.87m vehicles in China in 2016, up 7.1% from the previous year. China accounts for a third of GM’s sales. Like its corporate peers, GM has – so far – remained silent over Trump’s anti-China rhetoric, but a trade war would be a disaster for the company. Facebook Twitter Pinterest What will be the first actions Trump takes as president? Some wonder if Trump will really translate tough talk into policy. “There is always a difference between campaigning and governing and we have not yet seen what governing looks like,” said Dziczek. Others are more concerned. Trump is in a honeymoon period because “there is nobody speaking out”, said Daniel Ikenson, director of the Herbert A Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Republicans have remained silent as he has attacked businesses they once defended and the business community has even gone out of its way to endorse Trump cabinet picks that have overt protectionist views, he said. 'Fear and threats': Mexico hits back after Trump pressures automakers Read more The incoming president has clearly signalled that Obama’s trade-friendly, internationalist era is over, said Ikenson. The US steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer is Trump’s choice for United States trade representative, the anti-China economist Peter Navarro is set to head the newly created National Trade Council at the White House and the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, a staunch critic of the US’s existing trade agreements, is Trump’s pick to lead the commerce department. “These are people who if you mentioned them a few months ago, businesspeople would shudder. Now: ‘Hey, great idea, we like the enforcement mentality.’ They are scared. To me, this is extremely disconcerting and dangerous. This silence of people who should be speaking out is reminiscent of the 1930s. The stakes might be different but the it’s a similar sort of thing,” Ikenson said. So far, corporate reaction to Trump’s election has been bland; business leaders like that he’s is “pro-growth” and wants to cut red tape. But that may change once Trump is in office. The president may also find that changing the industry is harder than he thinks. The auto industry is a global supplier with a global supply chain. While it’s politically easy to target US neighbours like Mexico for “taking American jobs”, the real picture is more nuanced than anything you could fit into a 140-character tweet. Forty per cent of the parts that make up the average vehicle imported to the US from Mexico were made in the US. “We are sending them parts, engines, transmissions that then come back to us as vehicles that have been assembled,” said Dziczek. Imposing duties on foreign imports makes about as much sense as “building a concrete wall in the middle of what used to be Ford’s Dearborn plant”, said Ikenson. “The factory floor spans borders and oceans now. Imposing tariffs like this is like separating the chassis line from the engine line.” Mexico CAR is predicting Mexican auto assembly capacity will more than double in size between 2010 and 2020, thanks in part to lower labour costs but also to Mexico’s free trade agreements with 40 countries that give it access to 47% of the world’s automotive market. In the next five years, CAR predicts, most Mexican car exports will go to countries outside the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which Trump has attacked for taking US jobs. Dziczek doubts one man, even the US president, can hold back those forces. “You put a plant in place for 30 or 40 years. You don’t worry about four to eight years. Plants last a lot longer than presidents,” she said. As Trump prepares to take office, Ikenson said he worried that autoworkers and other voters who backed Trump in part as a protest against the impact of decades of free trade may not like what they get. If trade agreements are scrapped and imports imposed on foreign goods, “they will be the first wave of casualties. We went from 19m workers in manufacturing in 1979 to about 12m today. That goes down to 10m workers,” he predicted. But Trump and Trump’s voters have heard this argument before and they aren’t buying it. On the crowded floor of Detroit’s Cobo Center this week, and in the suites and conference rooms of its hotels, the car industry’s biggest brains will all be working overtime trying to figure out how to deal with the man their workers elected.

The world's largest aerospace company by sales closed 2016 with 668 net new orders worth $94.1 billion at list price, missing its goal of matching new deals with deliveries as it shipped 748 jets over the year. Rapid growth in air travel in Asia and the arrival of new more-fuel-efficient jets, just as oil prices started to rebound, fueled demand from airlines and leasing companies for planes from Boeing and rival Airbus SE. However, growth has cooled, particularly for larger twin-aisle jets used for international flights, leading both companies to trim production of those models. Boeing still has a backlog stretching out for seven years of production and this week added deals for almost 200 new jets secured in the final days of last year. The late surge lifted its book-to-bill ratio -- which measures incoming orders against deliveries -- to 0.9. "To many investors, a book-to-bill [below one] is traditionally the end of the cycle," said Buckingham Research analyst Richard Safran. The Chicago-based plane maker had 768 net new jet orders in 2015 and an average of more than 1,300 in each of the prior three years as the boom lasted longer than previous industry cycles. Airline profits and jet purchases are closely tied to global economic growth, which in turn fuels passenger and cargo traffic. The sluggish pace of new orders in the second half of last year led most investors to expect Boeing to miss its internal target of matching orders and deliveries, with more attention focused on its ability to deliver more jets as it prepares to boost output of its best-selling 737 single-aisle jets. The company secured deals for 848 new jets last year but had cancellations for 180, the majority of them from customers switching to the new 737 Max model that is due to start operating later this year. Boeing has yet to book an 80-plane contract completed with Iran Air in December, citing the need for further government approvals. Airbus plans to include a 100-plane deal with Iran Air in its 2016 tally, due to be released on Jan. 11. Analysts expect the European manufacturer to have secured orders for around 600 jets last year compared with 1,080 in 2015. While carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co. and Turkish Airlines have deferred some deliveries, Boeing executives have said such moves remain below their historical average. Airlines pay the bulk of an aircraft's price on delivery, and Boeing's 748 deliveries last year compared with 762 in 2015. The new 737 Max is central to Boeing's expansion plans, and unlike the 787 Dreamliner, its development has been relatively smooth. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA expects to take its first planes in May, well ahead of Boeing's original target of delivering the initial planes by the third quarter. Southwest Airlines also expects to receive the planes this year.

This photograph of Azalea Park was used often to promote the area. Click here to enlarge image 1947: Serious matters and a newfangled invention Claudia Elliot Published Jan 6, 2017 at 07:30PM Three important matters found their way onto the pages of the Pilot in the fall of 1947: taxes, a landmark decision about Indian lands, and the arrival of a new-fangled invention in Brookings. Also worth noting, a young man named Gene Gould — who graduated in the spring from high school in Brookings and had been working for the Pilot for 15 months, headed off to Eugene to enroll in the University of Oregon School of Journalism. Gould had moved to Brookings from Los Angeles with his parents (who later owned a shoe store). At his high school in California he had taken a course in printing, and his skills were highly valued by the Pilot. Through other research, I learned that Gould served in the Air Force in Korea after he graduated from college in 1951. He later settled in Seattle, beginning a long career with Boeing. He retired in 1990, and continued living in Virginia until his death on March 17, 2016. School opening delayed Brookings schools were set to open Sept. 15, but the opening was postponed after voters refused to approve an increase in the tax levy. “We have no money on which to open,” a school district official said. Without approval by voters the district would have only $26,058.53 to operate. The proposed budget was $34,840. There were 142 students in grades one through six and 133 in grades seven through 12. Finally, on Oct. 2, the school budget carried by a vote of 219-120. It was the largest vote in the history of the school. Opponents were unsuccessful in their appeal to the state tax commission. Sales tax vote A statewide vote was held in October in an attempt to impose a sales tax throughout the state to support schools, welfare and other government. Supporters said the measure would reduce property taxes by 22 percent and also lower income tax, support school districts without increasing property taxes and guarantee old-age assistance by making up whatever is lacking from declining liquor revenues. Like earlier attempts to impose a sales tax, the measure failed. Indian Lands settlement A big story throughout the latter half of 1947 concerned the value of more than 2.7 acres of Oregon land that a court had ruled (in 1946) was taken from Native Americans without compensation. In August more than 70 people attended a special meeting of Curry County Indian Heirs Association in Brookings. Attendees were assisted in filling out identification blanks and heard a report from geologists, who were making an appraisal of the amount of minerals taken from area since 1855. An appraisal of timber values of 1855 had been completed. Reports were to be submitted to courts on Oct. 20. In October, a front page story reported that a ruling was expected by early 1948 following hearings in which more than three-score documents introduced by the Tillamook, Coquille, Too-Too-To-ey and Chetco indians to bolster their claim the land was worth more than $13 million in 1855. According to the Pilot, the hearings were the result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision declaring that the Indians had the right to recover the 1855 value of the land taken from them by settlers after they were moved to the Siletz Reservation through a treaty never ratified by the United States Senate. The Pilot and the Indians had no way of knowing at the time that the landmark court decision (United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks) was just one more chapter in the complicated story of the relationship between the government and the native people of Western Oregon. The complete story is beyond the scope of this column, but I can find no evidence that the native people of Curry County received the payments they thought might be coming in 1947. “Automatic laundry” With all of that serious news was interesting coverage of an “automatic laundry” with three washing machines and one clothes dryer that C.A. MacKenzie opened in Brookings in the fall of 1947. This was big news, as the washing machines would automatically wash and rinse and leave the wash “drier” than a wringer-type machine. And the installation of a clothes dryer meant people wouldn’t have to hang their clothing inside on rainy days. “This automatic laundry idea is not new,” the Pilot reported, “for many cities all over California have such establishments, and women use them, even if they do have washing equipment at home, all because of the time saving. Washing is done on a per pound-hour basis and said to be low in cost.” An advertisement suggested making an appointment to avoid waiting your turn. The interior of the new “Launderall” was “a pleasing light green” with chairs and tables provided so that wash day can be used by the women to write letters, do some fancy work or visit, the newspaper reported. Bridge games were also anticipated. The innovation was celebrated by an editorial in the Pilot. “When we think of how our grandmothers (and mothers to many of us) used to use the old washboard and the boiler sitting on the range, and then look at this new convenience Brookings has, we see that we have come a long way, in some things,” editor Dewey Akers wrote. “After a woman puts her wash in these machines, she never touches them until they are completely rinsed. The hands never really get wet while transferring the clothes to the dryer, something to remember, while attempting to do the family wash in any other manner.” ~~~ Claudia Elliott is a freelance writer.

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara) Sydney - Japanese shares hit a six-month top on Tuesday as the dollar advanced on the yen, while risk sentiment got a lift after factory surveys in the United States and Europe boasted the best readings of the year so far. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 percent to its highest since late April as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.3 percent. Markets elsewhere were more mixed, leaving MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan flat. South Korea's main index slipped 0.6 percent after data showed Samsung Electronic's decision to scrap its Galaxy Note 7 dragged on the entire economy in the third quarter, though growth still pipped forecasts. Wall Street had taken encouragement from upbeat corporate results and the Dow ended Monday up 0.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.91 percent. Over one third of US companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added an extra fizz in the wake of AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Aiding risk sentiment was the Markit survey of US manufacturing which climbed to a one-year top of 53.2. Business activity in the euro zone also expanded at the fastest pace this year so far in October and firms raised prices at the sharpest rate in more than five years. The better news led investors to nudge up the probability of a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve to around 74 percent and pressured Treasury prices. It also lifted the US dollar to a nine-month high against a basket of major currencies at 98.846. The dollar firmed on the yen to 104.43, threatening the month's peak at 104.62, while the euro struggled at $1.0870. One mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the US dollar down to C$1.3345 from a peak at C$1.3398. In commodities, oil prices dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 6 cents at $51.40 a barrel, while US crude also lost 6 cents to $50.46.

Grow up. Time to be an adult,” he said in an interview on PBS. “You’re president. You’ve got to do something. Show us what you have. You’re going to propose legislation. We’re going to get to debate it. Let the public decide. Let them vote in Congress. Let’s see what happens.” Biden’s remarks came during a continuing stream of inflammatory Trump tweets, including ones that called Senate Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer a clown, mocked America’s intelligence agencies and gave credit to Internet outlaw Julian Assange, whose WikiLeaks site aided Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election. Biden’s point is exactly right: If he is to be successful in his new role, Trump needs to make the shift from insurgent campaigner and tweeter to president of the world’s superpower. On January 20, as he takes the oath of office and the weight of the presidency falls on his shoulders, Trump will, for the first time in his life, be employed outside his family’s business. At age 70, he will become accountable to the American people who will begin to learn whether this man with no experience in public service is up to the most demanding political job in the world. Big adjustments in a long career Has Trump ever made such a shift in roles? He hasn’t had to reboot himself in anything like the manner now required. But over his long career he has had to make big adjustments. For example, when his companies ran out of money to pay their lenders and filed for bankruptcy in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009, he had to accept the strict terms and oversight required by bankruptcy agreements. The 1991 case was especially chastening, as Trump was even placed on a monthly budget by his creditors. When Mark Burnett came to him with the idea for “The Apprentice” TV show, Trump had to overcome his natural reluctance when it came to firing people (he actually hates doing it). And finally, when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower in the summer of 2015, he had to assume the role of contender for the Republican party nomination. To woo the hard-right conservatives who provide much of his base in GOP primaries, he had to morph into a right-wing conservative even though he had once favored abortion rights, tax increases and stricter gun control. The pivot that didn’t happen During the election campaign Trump was eagerly watched for signs that he would ease away from his bombast and offer more than rambling displays of emotion to the voters. In other words, we waited for him to become “presidential.” At that time the key word was not “transition” but “pivot,” and Trump’s advisors often predicted that a turn toward normalcy was at hand. At one point Trump himself recognized the need for change and announced, “I will be so presidential you will be so bored. You’ll say, ‘Can’t he have a little more energy?'” The pivot never came. Instead Trump continued to improvise in response to news events, promoting doubt about his opponent while revealing few details about just how he would fulfill his promise to Make America Great Again. The strategy failed to win Trump a majority of votes. Indeed, Hillary Clinton bested him by nearly 2.9 million votes. But thanks to the Electoral College he won anyway. After winning the election Trump remained devoted to his game of gesture and symbols, picking little fights with companies like Boeing and Toyota while foregoing serious work such as learning about national security in the formal briefings presidents have accepted going back to the Kennedy administration. As he neglects his serious duties in favor of indulging himself on Twitter, Trump tells us that he will not change his style merely because he was elected president. Potential to change? A president’s style does matter. And so far, Trump’s tweets have upset those who value stability in world affairs and generosity of spirit in the Oval Office. However the new administration’s policies will matter every bit as much as its tone, and here the President-elect has demonstrated more flexibility than some would expect. When his fellow Republicans moved to neuter the ethics board that oversees Congress, Trump objected and they reversed course. More recently he has observed the rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act and warned the GOP to “be careful” lest they create a problem worse than the one they claim to be fixing. On health care and the ethics office episode, Trump deviated from his party’s orthodoxy and aligned himself with what he believes most American people want. These acts displayed the fact that he is eager to be seen as decisive, and is more concerned with his own popularity than political orthodoxy. This is, after all, the man who just this week referred to himself as a TV “ratings machine” as he criticized his replacement on “The Apprentice,” Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump’s policy adjustments may not show that he is a grownup in the sense that Biden prefers. But they do show he has the potential to transition from candidate to president. He’ll likely remain a crude, insulting and ill-tempered man, but as a president he could still find a way to some success.

The poor countries can retain their oil wells and their coal mines, but the oil wells and coal mines are hollow. Recently, some people have talked about the so-called the "4th industrial revolution" and they said that this revolution will create tremendous benefits from new products and services with negligible costs to serve customers, to make human life easier and more productive. The "Revolution" is expected to be a big trend that will have an impact on economic and social development on a global scale, in every nation, in every region, including Vietnam. It is very disturbing, even dangerous, if we do not have a clear understanding and vision about the nature of the so-called "revolution" because if you accept it without thorough understanding it will lead to mistakes in making policies, economic and social development strategies, which may affect the future and destiny of the country. In 2011, the term "Industry 4.0" appeared for the first time in a high-tech strategy of the German government to promote computerization of production through connecting machines and intelligent control systems. Less than five years later, the concept of "Industry 4.0" was expanded and the 4th industrial revolution was chosen as the theme of the World Economic Forum held in January 2016 in Davos, Switzerland. Many international organizations and scholars, notably Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum 2016, forecasted that "this revolution will fundamentally change the way people live, work, and have connections with each other" [1], so many countries have been considering and building new policies and strategies to be compatible with the 4th industrial revolution. However, there is no clear definition of the so-called the 4th revolution apart from some ideas that it is based on a number of technologies such as the Internet of Things, Internet of service [2], artificial intelligence, cloud computing or 3D printing technology ... [3] First of all, to say a phenomenon becomes a revolution, especially a revolution of global nature, one of the classical methods, the most reliable way is to study the political-economic nature of the phenomenon. By definition, a revolution is the elimination of the old in order to replace with the new and the more progressive thing. It implies fundamental, radical and significant changes with widespread impact occurring in a relatively short time, and in particular, there is a fundamental change of productive forces and production relations, including the ownership of material for production and production tools as well as the division of labor. Production forces Human history has witnessed three revolutions: the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution and the IT revolution, which created the agricultural economy, the industrial economy and the knowledge-based economy, respectively, making fundamental change in the way people work and produce. The 4th industrial revolution is said to be based on the development of many technologies, especially the Internet of Things, cloud computing and information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing technology, automation ..., so in terms of technology, it is IT. Therefore, we can say that the so-called 4th industrial revolution is the next stage of development of the IT revolution, not anything else. Changes in production methods through IT like e-working, e-learning, e-business, e-government, machines replacing people, and virtualization ... have been discussed extensively in the academic article on the IT revolution, so we will not mention it in this article. The biggest difference compared to other revolutions, if it occurs, is located in a change in the relations of production, especially possession, possession of production tools, production materials and the division of labor, although the change has taken place since the service revolution began in the 1960s, which developed particularly strongly in the late 20th century and early 21st century, in the so-called "knowledge-based economy". Speaking broadly, the knowledge-based economy is an economy creating human capital, including knowledge-based goods and services, with intangible nature and high exchange value (for example electronics, computer software, training, consulting, loans ...) in exchange for other goods, including material goods, mainly natural capital. The exchanges are protected through national, multinational and international institutions via trade agreements, notably WTO trade agreements. If in the industrial economy of the 19th century, the means of production belonged to employers, and workers did not hold materials for production and both subjects were in the same country, in the current knowledge-based economy, materials for production and production tools belong to rich countries, or multinational groups of rich countries, while employees and workers are in the poor countries. Thus, in the knowledge-based economy of the 21st century, there is a change in the division of labor globally instead of the division of labor in the national territory and this leads to a divergence between rich countries and poor countries rather than the differentiation between the capitalist class and the proletariat of the 19th century and the class contradictions within a nation have gradually been replaced by conflicts between nations. Some may say that this argument runs counter to the trend of globalization, with many new kinds of trade agreements. However, the phenomenon of nationalism and protectionism is gradually spreading in many countries such as China, Russia, the Brexit in the UK, Duterte in the Philippines or Trump in the US. These are testament to this trend.  The poor in poor countries seek to counteract this trend by moving to rich countries to become citizens of rich countries. This has resulted in immigration movements that are taking place in Europe and this is a typical example of the new movement of nationalism and protectionism. A new point in the knowledge-based economy is the change in the way of appropriating materials for production and natural resources. Many scholars believe that the knowledge-based economy is non-physical economy, under which knowledge of high-value is more important than material goods. Therefore the economic sectors based on high technology must occupy higher positions than the traditional sectors such as agriculture, mining. Economic development strategies have to give priority for the new technology sectors like the 4th industrial revolution. The question is whether the people in rich countries need to eat, wear, and use material goods or not? I'm sure the answer is yes. However, how will they get this kind of goods? By means of exchange of knowledge goods or services to obtain material goods (what I call exchange of Mind for Mass). Notably, the method of exchange is always unequal, discrimination between material goods and immaterial goods. The "double standards" in globalization are showed through a variety of WTO’s institutions such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) [5]. These double standards have been manifested more clearly in the neoliberal trade agreements such the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In these agreements, material goods subjected to the HS code for across-border control, quality control and other kinds of control while the knowledge goods and services such as IT services and e-commerce do not bear an HS code, so when they are exchanged cross-border, they are not under any control, no tax pressure, as well as no quality barriers. Another important point in the knowledge-based economy is that material goods always have cheap value (although the price can be very high), even very cheap compared to non-physical goods. A typical example:  the value of Vietnam’s 2.6 tons of rice is equal to one iPhone 7+ cell phone. And how many tons of rice Vietnam should be sold to buy a Boeing 787 Dreamliner? The difference in price is completely contrary to the most basic rules of the traditional economy, the law of value and the law of supply and demand in economic theories, including the theory of Marx. According to the law of value, the production and exchange of goods are based on necessary social labor consumption, while under the law on supply and demand, the price of goods depends on the adjustment of the market when it reaches a balance between supply and demand. Under these rules, high-value goods are goods with high demand or goods with scarce supply or have high social labor consumption and vice versa. However, in reality, material goods are always in high demand. There are many commodities that are used just onetime by one user, thus they are becoming scarce, even permanently exhausted. Knowledge goods are not scarce at all. A software, a service, an intellectual product can be copied for the use of a lot of people multiple times. This shortage is artificially created through provisions on the protection of intellectual property. Thus, in the knowledge-based economy, the institutions are contrary to the most basic economic laws of supply – demand and value, signaling a wrong signal about the abundance of material goods and the scarcity of non-material goods, while it supposes to be the opposite. Thus, the knowledge-based economy is benefiting the rich, who own production materials. Concerning labor: manual labor is gradually replaced by special machines and robots. New technologies may be able to create new jobs, but might not create new jobs. The replacement of humans by machines, especially IT and automation, will become more intense, leading to worsening unemployment, especially low-skilled workers, if we don’t have timely and appropriate responses. Therefore, the training of human resources in terms of knowledge and new technologies as well as building an environment that supports innovation is vital to adapt to the technology revolution. The fundamental change of the knowledge-based economy has led to the risk of resource depletion, threatening the survival of poor countries while the rich countries can keep resources for the future, which were sucked from poor countries like a spider that stretches its trunk to suck all the blood of its prey clean until death without directly invading these countries. Poor countries like Vietnam can retain their oil wells and coal mines, but they become hollow wells and mines. Thus, the 4th industrial revolution is just one phase of the IT revolution, the knowledge-based economy. The knowledge-based economy is the development of the capitalist economic model with fundamental changes on value creation, resource possession and global division of labor. These fundamental changes will require Vietnam to soon have thorough, comprehensive and timely studies about this economy in order to have appropriate policies.  Dr. Nguyen Thanh Tuyen and MA.

January 16, 2017 0248 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:175332 Publish Date: Sun, 08 Jan 2017 18:45:14 GMT Service: Iran Iran takes ownership of first passenger jet under sanctions deal Airbus said on Sunday Iran's state airline Iran Air had accepted its first new jet, marking a key step in opening up trade under a nuclear sanctions deal between Iran and major powers. The Airbus A321 jetliner has been painted in Iran Air livery and is expected to be delivered later this week, reported Reuters. "The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done," a spokesman for the European planemaker said. Iranian regulators said the aircraft had been placed on the country's aircraft register, indicating Iran Air had taken ownership of the aircraft: The first of around 200 Western aircraft ordered since sanctions were lifted. "The registration has been done, and the delivery should be by the end of the week," Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Reuters by telephone. The 189-seat jet was assembled in Hamburg, Germany. From there, it is expected to be transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for a formal handover on Wednesday. Iran Air Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told IRNA that there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the Airbus jetliner in Tehran later this week. Iran Air has ordered 100 passenger jets from Airbus and 80 from its US rival Boeing under the nuclear deal, which called for the lifting of most international sanctions in exchange for modification on Iran's nuclear activities. Boeing also agreed last year to arrange the leasing of a further 29 aircraft. Iran Air is also negotiating a final agreement with European turbo-prop maker ATR. The company, joint-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, has provisionally agreed to supply 20 of its 70-seat regional planes with options for a further 20.     KeyWords Airbus jet Iran   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, intl. community condemn Bahrain’s execution of three activists Iran favors peace, stability promotion in Balkans: Rouhani Iran supports dialogue to resolve Iraq problems Iraq seeking to improve Iran-Saudi Arabia ties Sri Lanka eager to resume Iran oil imports Iran’s Mehrzad, Rahman Ones to Watch for 2017 Iran, Albania keen on cooperation Nuclear deal bolstered Iran’s global image Iran’s Esteghlal signs Uzbek midfielder Djeparov Iran volleyball skipper faces ban Most Visited Obama extends national emergency on Iran US will 'shoot down' North Korean missiles: Pentagon chief Pentagon deploys 300 Marines to Afghanistan's Helmand www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0686 sec

The Airbus A321 jetliner has been painted in IranAir livery and is expected to be delivered later this week. "The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done," a spokesman for the European planemaker said. Iranian regulators said the aircraft had been placed on the country's aircraft register, indicating IranAir had taken ownership of the aircraft: the first of around 200 Western aircraft ordered since sanctions were lifted. "The registration has been done, and the delivery should be by the end of the week," Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Reuters by telephone. The 189-seat jet was assembled in Hamburg, Germany. From there, it is expected to be transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for a formal handover on Wednesday. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told state news agency IRNA there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the Airbus jetliner in Tehran later this week. IranAir has ordered 100 passenger jets from Airbus and 80 from its U.S. rival Boeing under the nuclear deal, which called for the lifting of most international sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Boeing also agreed last year to arrange the leasing of a further 29 aircraft. IranAir is also negotiating a final agreement with European turbo-prop maker ATR. The company, joint-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, has provisionally agreed to supply 20 of its 70-seat regional planes with options for a further 20.

The Iran Air officials announced on Sunday that they have received the first Airbus 321 plane, adding that it is being prepared to fly to the country.  Iranian Deputy Transportation Minister Asqar Fakhrieh Kashan announced late last month that Airbus and the ATR companies will deliver 8 new passenger planes to Iran Air by the end of this year. "Based on the contract signed with Airbus, the company will deliver one A320 and two long-range A330 planes to Iran Air by the end of this (Iranian) year (ending on March 20)," Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Iran Air will receive 8 new Airbus and ATR planes by the end of this year," he added. Airbus sealed a contract with Iran Air in December to sell 100 of its passenger planes, worth over $18 billion. The announcement came after Iran Air Managing Director Farhad Parvaresh and Airbus President Fabrice Bregier finalized a deal which was initially signed in Paris back in January 2016. The agreement covered 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft, with deliveries due to begin in early 2017. Airbus is the world’s Number 2 jet maker after Boeing, a US-based multinational plane manufacturer. Bregier described the deal as “a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector,” saying it also includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management. Parvaresh, for his part, expressed delight at cooperation with Airbus, stressing it has paved the way “for more practical steps to follow for Iran Air’s fleet renewal.” "Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation. We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration,” he added. The deal with Airbus received the go-ahead from the US Treasury Department in November. Early in December, Iran Air finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from US plane maker Boeing Co., with the planes scheduled to start arriving in 2018. The deals were made possible after the US removed a ban on selling Iran passenger aircraft and spare parts following the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Tehran and the six world powers (the US, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany) hammered out the nuclear accord in July 2015. It went into effect in January 2016 and resolved a long-running dispute over Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.         Related News Minister: Iran to Receive 20 New Passenger Planes Soon  Iran Attracts over $7bln of Finance from 3 Foreign Banks  Deputy Minister: Iran Air to Receive 8 New Passenger Planes from Airbus, ATR by Yearend  Envoy: Airbus Contract to Bolster Iran's Financial Ties with Europe  Iran Air to Purchase 100 Passenger Planes From Airbus  LATEST STORIES (8) Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed Syrian Army Repels ISIL's Massive Attack on Gov't Positions in Deir Ezzur City Week of Protests Kicks off with Rallies in DC, Chicago, California Libyan National Army's Fight against ISIL in Benghazi Syria: Buses Arrive to Evacuate Civilians and Militants from Wadi Bardi Syria: Aleppo's Famous Bazaar Reopens after Two Years of Closure Iranians Pay Tribute to Late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Bahrainis Simmering with Anger over Death Verdicts A Timeless American Tradition: Trump, Syria, and Giving in to Flinching Senior MP Renews Iran's Support for Political Solution to Iraq's Problems Iranian Speaker's Advisor Blasts Bahraini Regime for Executing Youth France Warns US about Serious Consequences over Embassy Relocation Senior Taliban Commander among 21 Killed in Security Operations across Afghanistan Eastern Ghouta: Syrian Army Tightens Up Grip on Terrorists in Wadi Al-Bardi, Recaptures Key Height Local Germans Want US Tanks to 'Get Out' Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed TEHRAN (FNA)- Clashes erupted between police and protesters in Sanabis, Sunday, after news broke that Bahrain had executed three anti-regime activists who were convicted over their alleged role in a 2014 bomb attack.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Every post-election week with Donald Trump feels like an eternity. The details change but the story stays the same: Trump whines, lies and pleads for attention, scrambling facts, fiction and conspiracy into a fatiguing, but now familiar blend. Last week followed the same formula, with Trump pretending not to know what he knows and to be an expert in everything he doesn’t know, all while waging petty wars using time that could be spent boning up on policy. He ended the week with an intelligence briefing (we’ve sunk so low, PEOTUS doing his job qualifies as news), but it did little to markedly shift the tone. And in that tone is the message, "We are so screwed." So we don’t forget, here’s a look back at just 10 of Trump’s most recent lies and fails. 1. Calling for an investigation of NBC instead of the Russian hacks. Trump’s denial of Russian cyberattacks in the face of tremendous evidence may be because he 1) actually thinks he knows more than the generals do; 2) is the ultimate Putin fanboy and debtor to Russia; or 3) is a Kremlin puppet. Add to this the fact that Trump refuses to have daily intelligence briefings because he’s “like, a smart person,” and the knowledge gap makes yet more sense. After making a big show of his disinterest in national security issues, Trump got huffy after NBC News offered a sneak peek into the findings detailed in an intelligence report on the Russian hacks. Though he’s steadfastly stood against an investigation into Russian cyberespionage against American democracy, he’s now calling for an investigation into “top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.” He cares because he was left out. Trump only wants to be in a club that won’t have him as a member. After finally sitting down to be briefed by intelligence officials Friday, Trump released a statement saying the meeting was "constructive," but he still failed to focus on Russia as the primary culprit, talking in circles. He announced that he'll be putting together a team to broadly combat cyberattacks, but said nothing about digging into the hacking the entire rest of the country wants to know about.  2. Making personal calls instead of doing his friggin’ job. A bitter, pathetic man who has dedicated his life to seeking revenge, Trump is still duking it out with Ohio governor John Kasich, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race nearly a year ago. Instead of attending to the things an incoming president should be, Trump took a break from hate-tweeting at TV shows to make personal phone calls to Ohio voters, all because he wants a Kasich-backed candidate to lose in the state GOP race. Funny what he finds time for. 3. Accepting Julian Assange’s word over 17 intelligence agencies. Trump doubts the experts of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies who contend they have concrete proof of Russian hacking, and thinks we should just go with Wikileaks founder and rape suspect Julian Assange on this one. Trump sent multiple tweets this week pushing Assange’s claims on the matter, along with bloviations from Fox News blowhard Sean Hannity. When called out on it, Trump tweeted, “The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!” 4. Admitting he duped his know-nothing voter base on the border wall, then lying again. As was apparent to any non-delusional person since Trump launched his campaign, there is no way Mexico is going to pay for Trump’s big, dumb wall. Trump, correctly estimating the sky-high gullibility of his base, knew this the whole time. In recent days, his team reportedly told House Republicans “that [Trump’s] preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process,” i.e., taxpayer dollars. After news leaked that Trump’s central campaign promise was a big lie, he told another lie to cover it up, insisting, “that any money spent on building the Great Wall…will be paid back by Mexico later!” Except no, it won’t. You can’t just invoice a country for your nonsense bad ideas, sorry. 5. Lying about having a hand in every job-saving deal. Trump has lied about creating or saving jobs for Sprint, Carrier and Ford. 6. But refusing to take credit for job losses. After Macy’s responded to Trump’s racist comments about Mexicans by removing his clothing line from the store (though his daughter Ivanka’s label is still sold there), he demanded his supporters boycott the department store chain for being “disloyal.” Whether that boycott was the source of Macy’s recent financial woes is up for debate, but since Trump has taken credit where it definitely isn’t due for the last 18 months (and pretty much his whole life), he deserves at least part of the blame for the 10,000 job cuts and 68 store closings the retailer announced days ago. That’s also true for Boeing, which saw stocks tumble after Trump tweeted negatively about it because he was angry about a magazine article. The company has announced it’s cutting 8 percent of jobs in 2017. And what about the 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores that are shuttering? Or the jobs McDonald’s is outsourcing to India? Not a peep from Trump, despite that fact that those unemployment numbers will be absorbed by the working class he lies about defending. All in all, the thousands of people who will be losing their jobs far outpaces the people whose jobs Trump only pretended to save.  7. Calling Democratic senator Chuck Shumer a 'clown,' then saying we need to unite 9 minutes later. The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017   …time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works – much less expensive & FAR BETTER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 8. Throwing Obama’s political ambassadors and their families out on short notice. According to the New York Times, Trump’s team has “issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day…breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.” There are reportedly “no exceptions,” including those previously granted to ambassadors who will need to uproot their families, especially those with school-age kids. The Times reports that the Trump decision “threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain.” “It feels like there’s an element just of spite and payback in it,” Derek Shearer, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland, told the newspaper. “I don’t see a higher policy motive.” 9. Scheduling a news conference to distract from his appointee hearings. Trump tweeted a few days ago that he “will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C.” That means nothing, considering Trump is a pathological liar who promises things all the time. Still, this press conference may happen, if only because it’s scheduled the same day as confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks. As Media Matters notes: “The strategy seems designed to ensure that the media is unable to devote sufficient scrutiny to each story and to reduce the possibility of an educated public responding…[B]y refusing to give a press conference for so long…Trump has created such a backlog of potential issues that it will be impossible for reporters to give all of them the time and coverage they deserve. Meanwhile, McConnell has done his best to fracture journalist attention by ensuring that six different confirmation hearings are scheduled for the same day…Several of these nominations are extremely controversial…But with all the hearings stacked on the same day, on top of Trump’s press conference, it’s impossible for the media to provide the information people need. And that’s the point—it appears to be a deliberate effort to manipulate both the press and the public.” 10. Still publicly smarting about being dissed by all the cool-kid pop stars for his little inauguration thing. He’s super bad at playing it cool.  Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the "Movement" — Donald J.

(Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) SEATTLE -- He turned the corner in a flash, sheathed in an avocado-green suit and matching fedora. He wore braids made of lime-green confetti and Seahawk-blue beads hung from his neck. Tracy Baublits stopped foot traffic with his day-glo get-up as he weaved through the packed streets hugging CenturyLink Field Stadium early Saturday afternoon before the Detroit Lions played the Seahawks in a wild-card playoff game won by Seattle. It was cold and damp, and his presence elicited “Seahawks!” chants as he dodged the crush of tailgaters. It felt like a tableau from Mardi Gras. Fans were decked in face paint and Seahawks colors, of course, but many had added more personal statements — wigs, fake beards, cleats, jewelry. None, however, cut a figure like Baublits, a 6-foot-4 walking advertisement for the hypercrazed 12th man, Seattle’s famed self-named fan base. “People expect me to be here,” said the 52-year-old from Fife, Wash., a small town near Tacoma some 30 miles south of Seattle. “I’ve been a season-ticket holder for 10 years.” The 12th man phenomenon predates him by a half-dozen years, but the identity as the NFL’s most vociferous fan base didn’t take hold until the team started making noise in the playoffs. Seattle lost its NBA team eight years ago and doesn’t have an NHL franchise. Soccer is popular here — the MLS team, the Sounders, recently won the MLS Cup — and the Washington Huskies have a sizeable fan base. Lions fans Grason and Kristen Edsinger in the fan zone before the Lions-Seahawks game Saturday in Seattle.  (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) The Mariners, meanwhile, have been nothing more than a tease the past couple of decades. Forging memorable regular seasons before flaming out in the postseason. All of this is to say that with the exception of the Sonics, who won an NBA title in 1979, this region hasn’t had a championship team until these Seahawks bullied their way to a Super Bowl win three years ago. That brought the region a kind of visceral civic pride that coffee chains and billionaire software techies couldn’t achieve. So say fans like Baublits, anyway, who spent most of the pregame party surrounding the stadium posing for pictures and piloting a remote-controlled buggy dragging a Lions doll behind it.

It’s not hard to imagine a similar scene unfolding in Detroit, filling the streets that funnel to Ford Field with a sort of unhinged revelry. Brian Anderson can see it now. A sea of silver and Honolulu blue. Fans spotting each other at the airport, in coffee shops, on the streets of metro Detroit, hollering out “Go Lions!” in the same way Seahawks recognize each other here. From the minute I landed late Friday afternoon, I’ve heard the Seahawks chants, rode buses with fans wearing scarves, knit caps and knee-high green and blue socks, watched as this whole town raised its fists in solidarity at the prospect of another extended playoff run. Speaking of fists, a food-trailer by the stadium was adorned with one holding a cheeseburger. It was called “The People’s Burger,” and it offered local ground beef patties slathered in Che Guevara consciousness. “Win or lose they are together,” said Brian Anderson, a Boeing inspector in nearby Everett who wore a Matthew Stafford jersey as he stood near the burger joint. Wait … what? Yes, Anderson was wearing a Lions jersey. He grew up near Ironwood in the Upper Peninsula. He moved out west three decades ago. Still, the Honolulu-and-silver stuck. It did, too, for brothers Dean and Darryl Robinson, 52-year-old twins who grew up in Southgate and left for a life in the Army. Dean served 28 years and Darryl 10. Both did stints in Iraq. Seahawks fans walk to the game against the Lions Saturday in Seattle.  (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) They are out now, and settled in the Pacific Northwest for its obvious livability standards. Yet they remain Detroiters in spirit, and in the sports teams they follow. Both sported Lions jerseys Saturday and hung near a bar spilling forth with fellow Lions fans. As much as they love their hometown team and its fan base, they admire what Seattle has built. “It’s a community,” Dean Robinson said. “They show up through and through. Back home, we talk about SOL — “Same Old Lions” — but here it’s different.” From left: Dean Robinson, Jerod Banner and Darryl Robinson -- all live in Seattle area. The Robinsons are twins and grew up in Southgate. Both served in the U.S. Army.  (Photo: Shawn Windsor, Detroit Free Press) Both brothers are convinced Detroit could offer a similar NFL experience if the Lions every truly made a Super Bowl run. Or, managed to host a playoff game. The truest connections are built when teams give their fans memorable moments. The Seahawks rose up and did this the past several years. “We can compete with these guys, no doubt,” Robinson said. “We have the blue-collar base.” They just don’t have the history. Not the right kind, anyway. All they need is an opportunity. Contact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.

CNN Money China fears protectionist Trump may thwart its exports China's customs agency said on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump may limit the growth of China's exports by imposing greater trade protectionist measures. According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal.2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money3:21 UP NEXT The headlines are full of scary reports about the dollar’s rise to a 14-year high against a basket of six major currencies. Its strength will hurt U.S. manufacturing while triggering capital flight from emerging markets, economists say. The appreciation “is a real serious noose around the neck of the global economy,” David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Arlington, Va., said in November. What’s really alarming, though, is that even though the dollar has jumped 6 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the yen since the U.S. presidential election, it remains well below its historic highs. If its rise to date is causing trouble, imagine how much worse things could get if it went on a serious upward run.

It’s the Federal Reserve’s index of the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies of 26 trading partners, with each one’s value adjusted for that nation’s inflation rate. This is a better indicator of the dollar’s strength than the frequently cited U.S. Dollar Index, which covers just six currencies and isn’t adjusted for inflation. The Fed’s index remains 10 percent below its 2002 high and fully 19 percent below the lofty high of 1985, which led to an emergency international accord to lower the greenback’s value through official, coordinated sales of dollar reserves. Fundamental factors are driving the dollar upward. Because U.S. growth is strong and unemployment low, Fed policymakers are projecting three more quarter-point increases in short-term rates in 2017. That will tend to push up the dollar by making U.S. Treasurys and other fixed-income investments more lucrative. Investors are also betting President-elect Donald Trump will touch off a growth spurt through tax cuts and infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, “The euro zone debt crisis and the travails of the Chinese renminbi have weakened the dollar’s main rivals and cemented its dominance as a key benchmark for other currencies,” Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad wrote in an e-mail. ABN Amro, a Dutch bank with a more extreme forecast than most, projects that the euro, worth $1.15 as recently as May, will be only 95¢ for most of 2017. Trump Gives the Dollar Wings, it headlined a November research report. A strong dollar is bad for U.S. growth, making American goods and services less competitive in world markets. A rule of thumb says that a 10 percent rise in the dollar increases the trade deficit by 1 percent of gross domestic product, and that translates into the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, says Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Warnings about the damage from dollar strength have come recently from U.S. companies including Boeing, Emerson Electric, 3M, and United Technologies. The greenback’s strength could cause problems in emerging markets such as Mexico and Turkey, because it increases how much of the local currency borrowers need to spend to make payments on bonds they issued in dollars. And bond issuers in those countries must pay higher interest to attract buyers when the Fed raises rates. Petróleos Mexicanos pointed to the peso’s depreciation as a factor in a 23 percent increase in the peso value of its debt in the first three quarters of 2016. In China, debt-laden builders are suddenly having trouble selling dollar-denominated bonds. At the end of 2015 there was $9.7 trillion in nonfinancial debt outside the U.S. issued in dollars, and one-third of it was owed by issuers in emerging markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is run jointly by the central banks of several countries. “If the current trend of dollar strength persists, it is very likely that we will see emerging market currency crises,” Variant Perception, a London-based research firm, wrote to clients in December. Whatever gains in trade competitiveness that emerging-market economies get when the dollar rises against their currencies can be outweighed by the rise in their borrowing costs, says a December research report by BIS economists Nikola Tarashev, Stefan Avdjiev, and Ben Cohen. That’s true mostly for countries whose finances are already fragile. Plenty of analysts see little reason for concern about the dollar’s rise. “We think the dollar has pretty much run its course,” says Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging-markets debt for Neuberger Berman, an asset management firm. Most emerging-market issuers of dollar debt are protected against a big dollar rise, either because they have offsetting financial hedges or because they receive a steady income of dollars from trade, says Joe Kogan, co-head of Latin America strategy at Scotia Capital Markets in New York. Emerging-market economies are in better shape than they were in 1997, when rising rates caused a financial crisis in Asia, says Mark Follett, managing director for emerging Asia debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong. Then again, Follett doesn’t know where the dollar is headed from here. “No one,” he says, “has any idea at the end of the day.” The bottom line: Several factors, from higher interest rates to a hoped-for Trump tax cut, are making the dollar stronger. ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

On Monday night, seven American Airlines flight attendants were rushed to an Orlando, Fla. hospital after experiencing headaches due to a foul odor. On Oct. 25, a dozen British Airways attendants on a flight from San Francisco began babbling, forgetting where they were, and stuffing their mouths full of food, after breathing in suspected toxins, the Sunday Times of London reported last week. The crew exhibited signs of “forgetfulness, confusion and inability to think straight” as well as nausea, headaches and dizziness, an internal airline report read. In both cases the airlines found no fault with their planes. The Aerotoxic Association — a watchddog group founded and run mostly by former airline pilots and attendants — claim 96 percent of “fume events” go unreported. It estimates 360 incidents occur each day in the US and 1,300 worldwide. Experts differ wildly on the frequency of such events which, according to the flight attendants union manual, are usually caused when oil or hydraulic fluid leaks onto hot engine compressors, releasing fumes that can leak into the cabin through old or faulty seals. A 2015 study by Kansas State University claims fumes seep into cabin air about 5.5 times a day on U.S.-based flights. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, “the events are rare,” with 900 reported incidents over the last 10 years — much fewer than one a day. “It just goes to show you how there’s such a massive discrepancy between what’s getting officially recorded and what’s not,” said John Hoyte, an English pilot who founded Aerotoxic Association in 2007. He claims his group’s estimates come from internal reports obtained through sources. SEE ALSO Flight attendants can't 'think straight' after 'toxic fumes' leak :0 British Airways attendants began babbling, stuffing food in their mouths... Flight attendants can't 'think straight' after 'toxic fumes' leak Hoyte said he had to quit his job with a regional carrier because “I felt like a zombie and like I was constantly intoxicated,” he said. “I had very bad memory problems, difficulty processing thoughts and terrible fatigue.” The FAA only requires airlines to report fume events if the cause is a confirmed mechanical failure, said Judith Anderson, a health and safety specialist with the Association of Flight Attendants. Fumes from leaking oil wouldn’t necessarily be reported. “Nobody is really keeping track of this — or at least not close track,” said Anderson. “We know this is happening and we see a consistent pattern of symptoms, but people don’t make the connection that toxic fumes are making them sick.” In April 2016, former Alaska Airlines flight attendant Vashti Escobedo sued Boeing after allegedly developing a stutter, a right-hand tremor and memory loss. She blames “contaminated cabin air” on an August 2015 flight from Seattle to Austin, TX, for making her “extremely disoriented” and ending her career, according to legal papers. Toxic fumes can also affect passengers, but flight staff experience worse problems because of repeated exposure, Anderson said. Jet engine oil contains an aromatic compound called tricresyl phosphate, which first developed for chemical warfare, according to published reports and advocates. It’s added to the engine oil as an anti-wear agent, necessary because of the extremely high temperature jet engines reach. When inhaled, such organophospates attack and kill brain cells. The FAA maintains that “studies have indicated that cabin air is as good as or better than the air found in offices and homes,” and that “the cabin environment in the vast majority of commercial flights is safe,” a spokeswoman said.

At a time when a number of airlines are downsizing, Qatar Airways continued to see strong growth and inaugurated 14 new destinations across its global network and welcomed 19 new aircraft to its fleet, taking the count to 192, as well as placing a record aircraft order to power future growth. Qatar Airways has made a number of strategic investments in other airlines and airline groups, while investing heavily in the continued evolution of its own passenger experience. Lauded for its success, Qatar Airways received a number of awards throughout the year, confirming it as one of the world’s leading carriers for business and leisure travel. Fans or followers can enjoy a video created by the airline, highlighting it’s most special moments here. The airline also celebrated its strong financial performance, having finished the 2016 fiscal year with an operating profit of more than QAR 3 billion – the best yet for the Qatar Airways Group. Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, said: “I am extremely proud of the success that Qatar Airways has achieved together with our employees and partners in 2016. I’d like to extend my sincere gratitude to all staff for their discipline and tireless pursuit for excellence. I’d also like to extend my gratitude to our loyal passengers for their continued support. Our passengers will see a continuation of our commitment to providing the very best travel experiences in the year to come. This past year has truly been an exceptional year and, and as we turn to 2017 to celebrate Qatar Airways 20th Anniversary, I look forward to celebrating future successes with our employees, partners and passengers in the years to come as we go places together.” Route expansion Qatar Airways is one of the fastest growing airlines in aviation history, with the airline now serving over 150 destinations following the inauguration of 14 new destinations in 2016 alone. Providing even more choice for travellers, the airline introduced exciting destinations such as Adelaide (Australia), Atlanta (USA), Birmingham (UK), Boston (USA), Helsinki (Finland), Los Angeles (USA), Marrakech (Morocco), Pisa (Italy), Ras Al-Khaimah (UAE), Sydney (Australia), Windhoek (Namibia),  Yerevan (Armenia), Krabi (Thailand) and Mahe (Seychelles). Fleet expansion Qatar Airways took delivery of 19 new aircraft in 2016, creating a total fleet of 192 aircraft. Having been the global launch customer of the A350, Qatar Airways continued to deliver on its fleet expansion and renewal strategy, having placed a record $11.7 billion order for 30 B787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, as well as signing a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 Max 8s valued at $6.9 billion. The landmark order, combined with previous orders results in a total of 350 Airbus and Boeing aircraft to be delivered to the airline over the coming years valued at more than $90 billion. Qatar Airways enjoys one of the youngest fleets in the world, averaging just five years, and the combination of its short and long haul mixed fleet provides the airline with the operational agility to maximize efficiency and profit by putting the right aircraft on the right route – every time. Qatar Airways’ private jet arm, Qatar Executive, was the global launch customer for the Gulfstream G650ER, and placed an order for a further three G650ERs – the fastest and longest range private jet aircraft in the world – at the Farnborough Airshow in July. The latest order will make Qatar Executive the largest dedicated G650 operator globally. Qatar Airways’ A380 is welcomed by a water cannon solute on its inaugural flight to Atlanta, USA in June.

Can The Businessman Do What Politicians Cannot? Published January 7, 2017 Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre0 Email Print AP By Joe Bilello -  Fox News @Joe_Bilello Have you ever read your morning paper and thought to yourself, "Why did it cost $17 million to plant some flowers in the town square?" Perhaps they had to pay a union crew to survey the land (drink coffee and talk about baseball) for a few months before starting the project. Then they had to pay a master electrician thousands of dollars to be on-call because of the underground power line 300 yards away. Then they heard that a family of pygmy turtles may be living in the area, so the project was delayed for six months. But payments continued. Or perhaps the town supervisor’s brother-in-law is a florist, a very wealthy florist. Whatever the reason, when the government gets involved, the price tag never seems to match the project at hand. Is it incompetence, carelessness, corruption or a combination of all three? Or just human nature? Wasting other people's money is not always a sign of corruption and criminality. Very often, it is merely a character trait of being human. When on their lunch break, many people often think, "How many White Castles can I get for five bucks?" But when in possession of the company credit card, the mentality suddenly shifts to, "Who's got the best porterhouse in town?" The guy who seems to drink responsibly when his cocktails are $12 a pop is the same guy who always has to be carried out of the company's open-bar Christmas party. Spending other people's money can be a very attractive prospect. So attractive, you can find yourself $20 trillion in debt before you know it. Can the new president change the mentality that is bankrupting future generations of Americans? Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall along the southern border was perhaps the primary rallying cry of his presidential campaign. His desire to curb illegal immigration and prevent potential terrorists, drug couriers and sex traffickers from entering the United States was very appealing to many voters. But for others, the true appeal of having a cutthroat businessman in the White House was when he spoke of the wall in a different context. In a February 2016 CNN-hosted GOP primary debate, moderator Wolf Blitzer questioned the cost of Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall, to which the candidate responded, "Now, the wall is $10 billion-$12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion." That one quote summed up the appeal of Donald Trump to millions of true fiscal conservatives. He envisions a project, sets a cost and timeframe and commits to completing the project on time, on or under budget. The government, on the other hand, envisions a project, estimates an absurdly bloated price tag and then ultimately spends ten times more time and money than originally estimated. Prior to the presidential election, the aircraft manufacturing company and major Clinton Foundation donor, Boeing, drew up plans for a new $4-plus billion Air Force One project. Their assumption was that newly-elected President Hillary Clinton would sign off on the plan, no questions asked, except perhaps whether they could sneak a few more luxuries in before production. Other people's money would be no object. But newly-elected businessman Trump did have some questions. Do we even need a new Air Force One? Why does it cost over $4 billion? After evaluating the situation, Mr. Trump concluded it was an unnecessary expenditure and simply proclaimed, "Cancel it!" Trump critics claim that the sophistication of the aircraft warrants a $4 billion price tag. But does anyone actually believe that there is no correlation between the cost of the plane and the cozy relationship between Boeing and the Clintons? After rejecting the proposal for a new Air Force One, at least under the current terms, Mr. Trump met with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson about bringing down the cost of the F-35 fighter jet.  Although not even president yet, it appears as though Donald Trump is asking the few simple questions that past presidents seemed incapable of asking – like why does it cost this much and do we really even need this? Not all politicians are corrupt thieves. Many are just human beings who suddenly have unlimited access to other people's money. And their frugality goes out the window the minute they get that taxpayer-funded, no-limit credit card. Donald Trump may not be any more ethical than anyone else. But the hope is that decades of a shrewd business mentality has been permanently ingrained in his mind, and he does not succumb to the usual inevitable corruption, or at least carelessness, that accompanies public office. Mr. Trump has always dealt with his own money and it remains to be seen whether or not his mindset will change when dealing with other people's money. But so far, he appears to be doing the right thing.

By Kali Holloway / AlterNet January 7, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: YouTube / CNN Every post-election week with Donald Trump feels like an eternity. The details change but the story stays the same: Trump whines, lies and pleads for attention, scrambling facts, fiction and conspiracy into a fatiguing, but now familiar blend. Last week followed the same formula, with Trump pretending not to know what he knows and to be an expert in everything he doesn’t know, all while waging petty wars using time that could be spent boning up on policy. He ended the week with an intelligence briefing (we’ve sunk so low, PEOTUS doing his job qualifies as news), but it did little to markedly shift the tone. And in that tone is the message, "We are so screwed." So we don’t forget, here’s a look back at just 10 of Trump’s most recent lies and fails. 1. Calling for an investigation of NBC instead of the Russian hacks. Trump’s denial of Russian cyberattacks in the face of tremendous evidence may be because he 1) actually thinks he knows more than the generals do; 2) is the ultimate Putin fanboy and debtor to Russia; or 3) is a Kremlin puppet. Add to this the fact that Trump refuses to have daily intelligence briefings because he’s “like, a smart person,” and the knowledge gap makes yet more sense. After making a big show of his disinterest in national security issues, Trump got huffy after NBC News offered a sneak peek into the findings detailed in an intelligence report on the Russian hacks. Though he’s steadfastly stood against an investigation into Russian cyberespionage against American democracy, he’s now calling for an investigation into “top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.” He cares because he was left out. Trump only wants to be in a club that won’t have him as a member. After finally sitting down to be briefed by intelligence officials Friday, Trump released a statement saying the meeting was "constructive," but he still failed to focus on Russia as the primary culprit, talking in circles. He announced that he'll be putting together a team to broadly combat cyberattacks, but said nothing about digging into the hacking the entire rest of the country wants to know about.  2. Making personal calls instead of doing his friggin’ job. A bitter, pathetic man who has dedicated his life to seeking revenge, Trump is still duking it out with Ohio governor John Kasich, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race nearly a year ago. Instead of attending to the things an incoming president should be, Trump took a break from hate-tweeting at TV shows to make personal phone calls to Ohio voters, all because he wants a Kasich-backed candidate to lose in the state GOP race. Funny what he finds time for. 3. Accepting Julian Assange’s word over 17 intelligence agencies. Trump doubts the experts of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies who contend they have concrete proof of Russian hacking, and thinks we should just go with Wikileaks founder and rape suspect Julian Assange on this one. Trump sent multiple tweets this week pushing Assange’s claims on the matter, along with bloviations from Fox News blowhard Sean Hannity. When called out on it, Trump tweeted, “The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!” 4. Admitting he duped his know-nothing voter base on the border wall, then lying again. As was apparent to any non-delusional person since Trump launched his campaign, there is no way Mexico is going to pay for Trump’s big, dumb wall. Trump, correctly estimating the sky-high gullibility of his base, knew this the whole time. In recent days, his team reportedly told House Republicans “that [Trump’s] preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process,” i.e., taxpayer dollars. After news leaked that Trump’s central campaign promise was a big lie, he told another lie to cover it up, insisting, “that any money spent on building the Great Wall...will be paid back by Mexico later!” Except no, it won’t. You can’t just invoice a country for your nonsense bad ideas, sorry. 5. Lying about having a hand in every job-saving deal. Trump has lied about creating or saving jobs for Sprint, Carrier and Ford. 6. But refusing to take credit for job losses. After Macy’s responded to Trump’s racist comments about Mexicans by removing his clothing line from the store (though his daughter Ivanka’s label is still sold there), he demanded his supporters boycott the department store chain for being “disloyal.” Whether that boycott was the source of Macy’s recent financial woes is up for debate, but since Trump has taken credit where it definitely isn’t due for the last 18 months (and pretty much his whole life), he deserves at least part of the blame for the 10,000 job cuts and 68 store closings the retailer announced days ago. That’s also true for Boeing, which saw stocks tumble after Trump tweeted negatively about it because he was angry about a magazine article. The company has announced it’s cutting 8 percent of jobs in 2017. And what about the 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores that are shuttering? Or the jobs McDonald’s is outsourcing to India? Not a peep from Trump, despite that fact that those unemployment numbers will be absorbed by the working class he lies about defending. All in all, the thousands of people who will be losing their jobs far outpaces the people whose jobs Trump only pretended to save.  7. Calling Democratic senator Chuck Shumer a 'clown,' then saying we need to unite 9 minutes later. The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017   ...time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 8. Throwing Obama’s political ambassadors and their families out on short notice. According to the New York Times, Trump’s team has “issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day...breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.” There are reportedly “no exceptions,” including those previously granted to ambassadors who will need to uproot their families, especially those with school-age kids. The Times reports that the Trump decision “threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain.” “It feels like there’s an element just of spite and payback in it,” Derek Shearer, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland, told the newspaper. “I don’t see a higher policy motive.” 9. Scheduling a news conference to distract from his appointee hearings. Trump tweeted a few days ago that he “will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C.” That means nothing, considering Trump is a pathological liar who promises things all the time. Still, this press conference may happen, if only because it’s scheduled the same day as confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks. As Media Matters notes: “The strategy seems designed to ensure that the media is unable to devote sufficient scrutiny to each story and to reduce the possibility of an educated public responding...[B]y refusing to give a press conference for so long...Trump has created such a backlog of potential issues that it will be impossible for reporters to give all of them the time and coverage they deserve. Meanwhile, McConnell has done his best to fracture journalist attention by ensuring that six different confirmation hearings are scheduled for the same day...Several of these nominations are extremely controversial...But with all the hearings stacked on the same day, on top of Trump’s press conference, it’s impossible for the media to provide the information people need. And that’s the point—it appears to be a deliberate effort to manipulate both the press and the public.” 10. Still publicly smarting about being dissed by all the cool-kid pop stars for his little inauguration thing. He’s super bad at playing it cool.  Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the "Movement"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017   Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!— Donald J.

Ford announced it would cancel its $1.6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!" GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U.S. car dealers. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn't change plans for its $1.6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump's rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. "Ford is a global automaker, but our home ... is right here in the United States," he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. "We've created 28,000 jobs and we've invested $12 billion in the U.S. in our plants in the last five years," Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. "I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet," says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and "the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous." Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U.S. firms and cost American jobs? Trump has pledged to rework U.S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U.S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, "I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain." Who's next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive F-35 fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others — consumer brands in particular — could find themselves targets. "Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U.S.," Hufbauer says. "My estimate is that this kind of thing [companies responding to tweets] is not going to have a major effect," and it is not in keeping with a well-functioning economy," says David Dollar, senior fellow for the Brookings Institution.

File Picture: EPA/NEELS KRUGER Kuala Lumpur — The hunt for missing flight MH370 will end in two weeks, Malaysia’s transport minister said on Friday, as relatives of passengers demanded that authorities push on with the search. "We’re at the final lap within these two weeks," the minister, Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. "We hope we can find the plane." Liow did not specify a date but said that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 120,000km² search ends. Authorities had previously said the search would end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia’s west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. Australia has said that it did not view the report findings as credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless "credible new information" emerged. "We cannot just base [a search] on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane," said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north. Many families have been long sceptical about whether the ongoing search is in the right place. In a statement late on Thursday, the international group of MH370 next-of-kin, Voice 370, called on Malaysia, Australia and China to consider the next step before the current search ends. "Extending the search to the new area defined by experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," it said. AFP Please login or register to comment.

Recapping the Airline's performance in 2016, Group CEO Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said: “2016 has been an exceptionally challenging year for the African Aviation industry. Commodity exporting countries in general and oil exporting African countries in particular have been hit hard by the global decline of commodity prices. As a result, demand for air travel has been suppressed and the shortage of foreign exchange has severely affected the financial performance of airlines in the continent.” “We celebrated our 70th anniversary, inaugurated the largest and the finest Aviation Academy in Africa and a state-of-the-art In-flight Catering facility which is the largest in the continent of Africa, introduced Africa's first Ethiopian Airbus A350, and spread our wings to more countries on 5 continents. Despite the sluggish growth in the world's matured market, all of our 12,000 colleagues remained focused on the robust execution of our vision 2025, which has proved to be a winning strategy in today's hyper-competitive and complex airline business. We wish to thank our valued customers for their continued vote of confidence on our services and for making Ethiopian as their airline of choice.” Major Diversification on the Core Fleet According to Mr. GebreMariam, Ethiopian has increased its fleet by 8 aircraft in 2016 and has closed the year with 82 airplanes in service. For the first time in its history, Ethiopian has diversified to include Airbus aircraft, with Africa's first A350. “With an average fleet age of just five years, Ethiopian has one of the youngest and most modern fleet in the world. Ethiopian has heavily invested in the two most technologically advanced fleet of our time; the B787 Dream Liner and the A350. With high performance, less carbon emission, advanced cabin features, and superior customer comfort, these airplanes are game changers in today's civil aviation industry. “Efficient Network of Convenient connectivity Living its motto of Bringing Africa Together and Closer to the World, Ethiopian has continued to connect the African continent with its major trading cities and markets. With connections as short as 30 minutes at our Addis Ababa hub airport, we offer the fastest travel time between Africa and the rest of the world for our customers. Both through our main hub in Addis and our regional hubs in Lomé (Togo) and Lilongwe (Malawi), we are connecting African brothers and sisters scale up tourism, trade and investment with in the continent.” He said in 2016 Ethiopian Airlines launched new international flights to the Comoros Islands, Windhoek, and Newark and domestic routes to Hawassa, Kebridahar and Dembidolo. “Ethiopian Cargo Services has also remained to be the largest cargo airline in Africa. Customer experience investments We have also been honored by the ways our world class service has been recognized: SKYTRAX World Airline Award for Best Airline Staff in Africa and Rising Star Carrier of the Year Award (both for the second year in a row), Cargo Airline of the Year, and African Airline of the Year Award are few to mention. “Redefining our passengers' onboard experience, we have successfully completed the modification of all our Boeing 787 Dreamliners with lie-flat beds. We have expanded and renovated our lounges in our Addis hub. In line with our new Inflight catering facilities, we have invested in upgrading our inflight meals with new menus, new cutlery, on board plating, new chinaware and new service delivery. We have also revamped our ShebaMiles Frequent Flyer Program with a major focus on enhancing our customers' experience. On ground, new advance check-in procedure to enable customers check-in at their convenience, newly designed website, self-check-in and self-boarding.” Infrastructure Aviation Academy: Under infrastructure, Mr. GebreMariam said Ethiopian has built largest and the latest Aviation Academy in Africa, with an investment of USD 100 million. “The Academy has the best aviation training technology that an airline academy can offer; full range of fleet cabin emergency, evacuation and door trainers fitted with a high standard swimming pool for cabin crew ditching exercises and more than 20 pilot training aircraft, Class Rooms, Student Cafeteria, Auditorium Hall, Student dormitory, Green compound with space for outdoor sports.” Cargo According to Mr. GebreMariam, the New Cargo Terminal, 82% complete, is expected to be operational towards April 2017, which will have an annual storage (for both dry and perishable goods) of 1.2 million tons and a capacity to handle eight B747-800 freighters at a time. Construction of the first phase only will cost approximately US$ 150 million. “Upon completion, our uplifting capability will be equivalent to the cargo terminals at Amsterdam Schiphol, Singapore Changi or Hong Kong. A Four Star Hotel construction: with the booming construction in our capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopian's four star hotel construction is progressing, with 30 percent completion. The hotel will have 330 rooms, a banquet hall to accommodate 2000 guests, restaurants, a swimming pool, gym, and spa. Catering: Ethiopian has inaugurated the largest Catering Facility in Africa, with a capacity more than all hotels in the city combined: 100,000 meals per day. It will soon commence third-party service and generate revenue to continue as an independent profit center.” Maintenance Hangar He said the newly built wide body maintenance hangar is now 97% completed. The hangar has two bays equipped with latest technologies; a full Paint hangar, and Maintenance hangar. The facility is capable of accommodating 2-B747-800 (the biggest Boeing airplane) at a time or more other type of aircraft in different arrangements. Simulator: Ethiopian has constructed a state-of–art flight simulator building and installed five of the latest full flight simulators (FFS). This includes; the Boeing 787, 777, 757, 767, 737NG and the Bombardier Q400. Likewise, we are on our way to have full flight simulators for A350XWB and Boeing B737 MAX aircrafts. Corporate Social Responsibility According to Mr. GebreMariam, during the 2016 Ethiopian has partnered with significant number of local and international organization to discharge its corporate Social responsibility including Free Shipment of Medicine by Airlink USA, Shipment of Colonel John Charles Robinson's Sculpture, humanitarian shipment for UNICEF Ethiopia and free ticket grants to support medical travelers abroad. – By: citifmonline.com/Ghana Comments: This article has 1 comments, leave your comment.

Options include subjecting well-known U.S. companies or ones with large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust probes, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Other possible measures include anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, the people said. The move illustrates how the fallout from escalating tensions between the two nations risks spreading to companies. Trump has made China a frequent target of his attacks and nominated trade-related officials who the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper said would form an “iron curtain” of protectionism. Any retaliation by China against Trump stands to be risky. A backlash may result in China damaging access to its biggest trading partner, said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. “When you have a country with a large trade deficit that retaliates against a country with a large trade surplus with it, it’s the country with the trade deficit that wins,” said Every. “The country with the surplus loses, every time.” America’s trade deficit with China narrowed to USD31.1 billion from $32.5 billion in October as U.S. exports to the nation were the strongest since December 2013, according to the most recent data available. That brought the trade deficit to $288.78 billion for the 10 months to the end of October. China’s central government compiled the possible countermeasures after collecting opinions from various departments, the people said. The punitive steps would only be carried out if the U.S. acts first and after senior Chinese leaders sign off on them, they said. In response to Bloomberg queries, China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen highlighted the benefits of maintaining good bilateral relations, saying that U.S. investments have not only helped Chinese employment but have also led to immense wealth for American companies. “I believe win-win economic ties between the two nations will keep moving forward,” Wang said. “No one wants a lose-lose scenario, and no one will want to harm the win-win ties. I’m still optimistic about future China-U.S. economic relations.” Wang also said the Ministry of Commerce will seek to level the playing field for foreign companies pitching to win government contracts and that it wouldn’t discriminate against foreign companies’ products made in China. Representatives at China’s State Administration of Taxation and General Administration of Customs either didn’t respond or couldn’t immediately comment to Bloomberg queries. Representatives at Trump’s transition team didn’t respond to a request for comment. Late last year, China fined General Motors Co., the second- largest foreign carmaker in the country, nearly $30 million for antitrust violations after the company was accused of setting minimum prices on some models made by its SAIC General Motors joint venture. GM said at the time it respects local laws and that it would fully support its venture in China to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Given how much they have at stake – Rhodium Group estimates American multinational corporations have poured more than $228 billion into China since 1990 – U.S. business groups have a history of pushing back against Washington on trade issues with China. In the 1990s, companies including Boeing Co., Motorola Inc. and American International Group Inc. were involved in lobbying efforts in the annual battle to renew China’s most-favored nation status that gave its exports low-tariff status in the U.S. In 2011, trade groups representing companies including Microsoft Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. lobbied against legislation to pressure China to raise the value of its currency. “Discriminating against foreign companies in the enforcement of laws and regulations harms not just those companies, but also the millions of Chinese who work for them, their local partners and those who use their products and services,” said William Zarit, chairman of the Beijing-based American Chamber of Commerce in China. “We urge the governments of both countries to find ways to build trust through increasing transparency, and to establish a level trade and commercial playing field. “ Bloomberg Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Categories China Share This Post Related Posts Critics attacked, history revised as China nationalism rises Father of Chinese Romanization, dies at 111 Paper calls Tillerson’s South Sea threat ‘foolish’ Hong Kong | No. 2 official quits, becomes favorite for top post No Comments Cancel Reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Monday, 16 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview Iran to Get First Purchased Airbus Aircraft Thursday News ID: 1291261 Service: Economy January, 08, 2017 - 16:18 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iran will receive the first jetliner from a series of aircraft it has bought from European plane manufacturer Airbus on Thursday, January 12, an official announced. Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh said on Sunday that the brand-new passenger plane, an A321, is expected to land in Tehran on Thursday. The plane will take off from Germany’s Hamburg with Iranian pilots, he noted, saying it will be used for domestic flights. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Iran and Airbus intensified business negotiations in October 2016 following the US decision to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France and Germany). While Western plane makers are very keen on trade with Iran, Washington still demands that even non-American manufacturers wishing to sell to Iran obtain an export license if their products include materials made in the United States. Airbus, based in Europe, buys more than 40 percent of all its aircraft parts from the US. Iran sealed another deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In December, the deal with Boing was finalized, allowing Iran to buy 80 planes within 10 years. The first deliveries are expected in 2018.

By: AFP | Tehran | Published:January 8, 2017 6:25 pm Iran is to take possession of the first aircraft this week in a huge order from Airbus placed after the lifting of international sanctions, state carrier Iran Air said Sunday. “This aircraft has received its certificate of registration and an Iran Air team is in place to take delivery of it,” the airline’s chief executive officer, Farhad Parvaresh, told the Fars news agency. “We hope to take delivery between now and the end of the week.” Iran Air completed the huge deal for 100 Airbus planes with a list price of around USD 20 billion (19 billion euros) on December 22. Iran had committed to the agreement during a visit to Paris by President Hassan Rouhani last January shortly after international sanctions were lifted under a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. But it required approval from Washington as some parts are manufactured in the United States. Watch what else is making news: The jets will bolster Iran’s ageing passenger fleet with the addition of 46 A320 planes for medium-haul routes, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 A350s. In another deal last month, Iran Air finalised an order for 80 planes from Airbus’s US competitor Boeing. Boeing said that contract — Iran’s first deal with a US aviation firm since the 1979 Islamic revolution — was worth USD 16.6 billion.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News US Arms Makers Rake in Billions Replacing Bombs for US Air Wars Precision Munitions Are Costly, and Used in Growing Numbers by Jason Ditz, January 06, 2017 Print This | Share This Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein has bragged that the US is “hitting more targets than we’ve ever hit in a long time in Iraq, Syria, and in Afghanistan,” with tens of thousands of bombs dropped in 2016 alone. Those numbers show no sign of getting smaller any time soon. That’s bad news for the people in those countries the bombs are falling on, and bad news for the taxpayers, but it’s great news for a handful of key US arms makers, who are seeing their sales soar on the orders that the military has placed to replace the dropped bombs and fired missiles. These bombs aren’t cheap, with even the smaller “dumb bombs” amounting to $30,000 or more, and more advanced technology like Lockheed Martin’s Hellfire missiles costing in excess of $100,000 each. With thousands of Hellfire missiles being fired, that’s a costly proposition. From the Pentagon’s perspective, the big issue in all of this is that the companies are having trouble escalating production fast enough to meet demand, and they are fretting that bombs are being dropped faster than they’re being replaced. For companies like Boeing and Lockheed, that’s a good problem to have, with the companies not just seeing record volume in their orders, but juicy margins on rush shipments as the Pentagon keeps finding new explodable stuff to drop things on.

Unwelcome Guest I do support the troops having the best possible weapons. But I’d certainly agree that it’d be better just to withdraw them. Leave the foreigners alone to mismanage their affairs as they see fit; just stop them coming to the US. Of course Obama is closing down the Muslim registration program, so Trump’ll have to restart it. Mikronos Go look for a job in Plano. If you have real American genetics, and love your country, you’re in. EME I heard that. USG economy is based on the sale of arms and drugs. The so-called ‘War on Terror’ and “War on Drugs’ are both bullshit propaganda. lordbaldric Probably vastly overpriced bombs. That’s what the US military is all about theses days- spending $$$ instead of actual combat effectiveness… Mark Thomason Yes, but given multiplication effects, it need not even be overpriced to cost as much as the weapons, or more. Bruce The Philosophical No amount of money can replace the dead. Fortunately we have a new administration coming in and the Don will be in charge. According to surveys four out of five murdered humans prefer to be slaughtered by a Republican or at least someone pretending to be. Mikronos It depends where those humans live. Possibly only in the USA would the politics of your killer make any difference at all. Most slaughtered people on earth know it was Americans who did it, or somebody paid by Americans to do it. That includes the ‘higher class’ of what what the US calls ‘terrorists’. Bruce The Philosophical I suspect that you are correct. My post was written tongue in cheek. Mark Thomason Nasty truth — ammo costs as much as the weapons themselves. It may be low tech, and it may be individually much less expensive, but then multiplication takes over. Take a civilian example — a normal hunting rifle is good for about 20,000 rounds fired over its lifetime, before needing at least a new barrel. Season after season, owner after owner, at firing ranges again and again, it will fire ammo costing over 20x the cost of the rifle. Machine guns? Even more. Artillery? Each round is even more. Aircraft are expensive, but they fly for years. They drop a vast number of bombs. If a bomb is $50,000, and the plane drops 1,000 of them, the bombs cost more than the plane. Ammo is kept piled up, as reserves for expenditure in major fighting. Thousands of rounds per artillery piece, thousands of bombs for an aircraft unit, stocked in each theater of potential fighting as pre-positioning. The US keeps billions in ammo in Israel, as a reserve they too can draw on. There is a lot of money in ammo. Mikronos The same folk probably have the printer ink market covered. novembersneverending After watching several videos from syria, I can’t imagine how much money had been wasted there. That huge quantity would give an economic cushion to the desperate people who originally revolted against assad Mikronos The Saudis and the UAE have dropped their ‘stocks’ on Yemen so, if the Israelis decide to clear the old munitions off into Gaza again, their should be enough overtime to see the bomb plants through to the first of July. EME Thomas, ‘not to reveal my age’, but I remember the 1960 epic classic, Spartacus. with Kirk Douglas, and Laurence Olivier. After the final battle which the Romans won, Crassus (Olivier), offered amnesty to the man who could identify Spartacus (Douglas). One by one, every man stood up and claimed himself to be ‘Spartacus’. That was an incredible and powerful scene. I often mention that scene to my friends at Code Pink.
