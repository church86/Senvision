The U.S. aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13% in from orders in 2015. The 2016 orders are worth $94.1 billion at list prices, it said. Boeing’s archrival Airbus said in November that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing’s most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company on Jan 4 announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth $8.25 billion, from General Electric’s airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January 2016 it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also fared badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing said in December it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes in 2016, up one from the prior year. © 2017 AFP Tweet Back to top 0 Comments Login to comment Back to top Login to leave a comment Facebook users Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

The issue with the flight attendants' uniforms came after American rolled out new uniforms to more than 70,000 of its frontline workers in September. The look of the uniforms has been well-received by many of American’s workers. But, in December, the carrier's flight attendant union called for a total recall of the uniforms, claiming the outfits have sickened as many as 2,000 attendants with symptoms that include rashes, itching, headaches and eye irritation. Clothing manufacturer Twin Hill pushed back against those complaints in a Monday letter to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union that represents American’s cabin crew. FULL TEXT: Twin Hill's letter to American Airlines' attendants Skip in Skip x Embed x Share American Airlines flight attendants say their new uniforms are making them sick. USA TODAY American Airlines attendants say new uniforms make them sick, demand 'full recall' In its letter to APFA leaders, Twin Hill asserts testing shows its uniforms to be safe, though the company added it is nonetheless eager to find a solution. Twin Hill also challenged the APFA over what it says are unsubstantiated claims. “Many of your public statements, in particular, have been both inaccurate and damaging to Twin Hill 's reputation,” Daryl Stilley – Twin Hill’s senior vice president and marketing director – said in the letter addressed to APFA national president Bob Ross and APFA national health chair Gabby Harty. “We were deeply concerned  when claims made by the APFA started to surface about your members having reactions to the American Airlines  uniforms  provided by Twin  Hill, and we immediately  leveraged  every  resource at our disposal  to investigate  those claims.” Stilley said that testing has “returned results concluding that the collection is safe.” But Stilley also challenged the APFA to follow through on a pledge to visit the company’s Houston warehouse along with American officials for joint chemical testing of the uniforms. “We don 't  expect  you  to take  our  word for  it -- we encourage you  to see for yourself, and to eliminate any doubts you still may have about  the authenticity and accuracy of the extensive testing that has been done and the safety of our garments,” Stilley added. “We supported  the request of APFA representatives  to visit our Houston distribution center and select uniforms directly for joint chemical testing with American Airlines,” Stilley continued. “We scheduled that visit - on three different occasions over the last eight weeks - and each time, the APFA has unilaterally cancelled the visit at the last moment. Considering the nature of your claims about your members' reactions, we are at a loss to understand what could take priority over this meeting.” USA TODAY The fleet and hubs of American Airlines, by the numbers FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn The fleet and hubs of American Airlines  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

About 350 attendants have filed formal complaints with the airline, spokeswoman LaKesha Brown told Today in the Sky. In the meantime, Twin Hill said in its letter that it has been working with American to come up with more alternatives for attendants reporting problems. USA TODAY American seeks uniform answers as attendants demand recall “American Airlines has already made our non-wool line available to individuals experiencing  any sensitivity to the uniforms, and we are now working  on designing entirely new 100% cotton garments as a third alternative,” Stilley wrote in the letter to the APFA. “We are committed to ensuring that every single AA employee has a uniform that is both safe and comfortable.” The letter closed with a renewed invitation for the APFA to participate in joint testing at the manufacturer’s facility. “Given the health reactions you assert your members are facing, we anticipate that you will not delay scheduling your visit to our distribution center any longer,” Silley said. “Please contact your American Airlines liaison, who will work with me to schedule that meeting. We remain as committed as ever to providing your members - and all of our customers - with the highest quality workwear in the industry.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky .

Here’s what you need to know to make the most of your miles this month. Alaska and Virgin America provide reciprocal benefits. The latest in domestic airline mergers, Alaska and Virgin America have tied the knot, becoming the fifth largest airline in the country. Their individual loyalty programs are taking the first step in alignment, meaning fliers can earn and burn miles on either carrier as well as enjoy elite-level perks like priority boarding and check-in. One of the most valuable changes is that Virgin America fliers can now earn miles based upon distance flown rather than dollars spent when flying Alaska flights (Alaska still awards miles based upon distance flown for its fliers). In the new year, Virgin America fliers will be asked to create Alaska Mileage Plan accounts as a next step toward creating a combined mileage program where 1.3 Mileage Plan miles will be equivalent to one Virgin America Elevate point or vice versa. USA TODAY Alaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love' RocketMiles will pay you in miles for unwanted, wacky holiday gifts. Not keen on that funky iPhone case or strange paperweight you received for the holidays? RocketMiles.com wants it! The travel website, which doles out airline miles for using its hotel reservation system, will give you a 500-mile bonus (in the airline program of your choice) on your next hotel booking if you mail your unwanted gift to them before Jan. 20. Send that ugly sweater to RocketMiles, 641 W. Lake Street, Ste. 102, Chicago, IL, 60661. Used or poorly handmade gifts are not eligible, and items must be received by Jan. 20. Only one bonus is eligible per customer, and be sure to include your name and email address associated with your RocketMiles account. American adds another elite layer. American’s Concierge Key fliers, a status reserved for fliers that spend the most with the carrier, got a nice present on Jan. 1. Previously, they were grouped into the top priority level with Executive Platinum members. In 2017, Concierge Key members will be part of a new elite tier that receives higher priority than Executive Platinum members when it comes to upgrade and standby wait lists. This is great news for the biggest spenders, but other elite fliers may see a few extra names ahead of them on the wait list. New to mileage programs? Delta has a bonus for you! If you are new to Delta’s SkyMiles program, Delta has some bonus miles for flying. All it takes is to fly internationally within the first six months of enrollment. Earn 5,000 miles for qualifying economy-class fares and 10,000 bonus miles for premium cabin fares. Alaska adds more to Mileage Plan benefits.In an era of diminishing benefits, here’s a positive change: Alaska is introducing a new one-way price of 5,000 miles for short-haul flight redemptions of less than 700 miles in travel distance. Also, the airline is adjusting its partner mileage-earning charts, giving a boost to the number of miles earned on flights with airlines like Icelandair and Emirates. Bonus American miles for flying Down Under. American has a great bonus offer for travelers flying to Sydney or Auckland. Book by Jan. 31 and fly between Feb. 1 and May 31 in a premium cabin or on certain economy-class fares to earn as many as 50,000 bonus miles. Be sure to use promotion code SPF16 and register for the promotion before travel.

Lee Samaha (TMFSaintGermain) Jan 9, 2017 at 1:09PM Free cash flow generation is the key to generating long-term value for shareholders, and there are three companies I'd like to look at that are planning on generating strong cash flow in 2017. First, Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) is set to significantly increase FCF in the coming years as it comes out of a period of high investment. Meanwhile, specialty materials and chemical product company Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) looks set to continue its remarkable transformation into a highly cash-generative operation. And finally, Boeing Co.'s (NYSE:BA) stock might sink or swim based on whether it meets its FCF guidance. Boeing is cutting production of its 777. Image source: Boeing Co. Honeywell International The aerospace, materials, and construction-focused company's outlook meeting in December saw management predicting that FCF would jump from a range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in 2016 to a new range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion in 2017. That's an increase of 7% to 12%, when EPS is only set to grow 8% to 10%. The reason? Honeywell is coming out of a period of elevated capital expenditures -- being made to generate future growth -- which has eaten into FCF generation. For example, the company's reinvestment ratio (capital expenditure over depreciation) is forecast to average around 1.6 in 2014-2016, when management believes a ratio of 1.2 is more normal. However, capital expenditure is set to fall in the coming years, and the spending reductions, alongside earnings increases, will boost FCF generation. Management expects capital expenditure in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for 2016 but sees it falling to the $800 million range in 2018. In other words, FCF is likely to increase by at least a few hundred million in the next couple of years, making Honeywell an attractive stock for investors who like cash flow. Celanese Corporation This company's plans to increase cash flow are already bearing fruit. FCF has increased significantly in recent years, even as Celanese has been hit by weak end demand in its acetyl chain segment from China -- which deals in acetic acid and derivatives used in the paints, coatings, and chemicals industries, among others. CE Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. The stock looks cheap on a price-to-FCF basis, but there is a word of warning here. Many manufacturers see increases in FCF during slowdowns because they cut capital expenditures in response. However, when the recovery comes, they tend to start spending again. You can see this dynamic expressed in Celanese's falling and then rising capital expenditures in and after the last recession. CE Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Nonetheless, Celanese management believes the productivity improvements and cost savings it's been making to deal with falling demand will hold the company in good stead in the future. CFO Chris Jensen expects FCF to exceed $850 million in 2016 (a record figure) and cumulatively reach $2.5 billion in the 2016-2018 period. To put this figure into perspective, it represents more than 18% of the company's current enterprise value (market cap plus net debt). Moreover, analysts expect Celanese to return to growth in 2017, with consensus estimates for sales to increase 5.7%. Boeing Co. Boeing's FCF is a quandry: Analysts are divided on whether it will grow in the next few years, but management is clear that it expects FCF growth. For example, back on the third-quarter earnings call in October, CFO Greg Smith said "our view on cash flow growth is unchanged," adding, "We continue to forecast cash flow growth in 2017 and then 2018 and beyond." In addition, on the same day that Boeing's management announced a production cut on its twin-aisle 777 jet -- a highly cash-generative aircraft -- to five a month, down from a rate of 8.3 a month in 2016, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said, "Boeing is well positioned to generate increasing cash flows." The key question is whether declines in cash flows resulting from reduced 777 production and the increased costs of starting production on the 777X will be more than offset by increases in 737 production in the coming years. The other concern is that 777 production might be cut again -- after all, Boeing generated only 17 net orders for the 777 in 2016.   Here's a look at Boeing's FCF and operating cash flow over the past five years. BA Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Smith expects annual operating cash flow to increase to $10 billion for the full year of 2016, compared with $9.4 billion in 2015. Whether Boeing's cash flow increases as planned in 2017 could be the key driver of its stock price this year. All three of these companies offer something for investors. Honeywell's underlying FCF improvements will start to come to the fore in the next year or so, and if Celanese can grow its top line again while maintaining good cash flow generation, then it will become a very attractive stock. Boeing simply needs to convince investors it can bridge the gap between the 777 and 777X while growing FCF. Lee Samaha has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing, but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence that planemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney. That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Mon Jan 9, 2017 | 11:52pm IST Exclusive - Airbus may post 8 percent rise in 2016 deliveries, narrow gap with Boeing The logo of Airbus is pictured on a scale model of an Airbus A350-1000 during its maiden flight event in Colomiers near Toulouse, Southwestern France, November 24, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo By Tim Hepher | PARIS PARIS Airbus (AIR.PA) is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing (BA.N), but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence that planemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N). That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

BUSINESS Technology This app will notify you if Trump tweets about a company whose stock you own Trigger app Trigger Trigger Karen Turner President-elect Donald Trump's tweets are proving again and again to have the capacity to make significant waves. Now there's an app — Trigger — that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies in which they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance Inc., whose app notifies, or "triggers," users about changes in market indicators. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it's become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, Boeing's stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company's F-35 jet program. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company's stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year's CES tech trade show. Rachel Mayer, co-founder and chief executive of Trigger Finance, said she's been hearing "overwhelming" demand from the app's user base for a Trump tweet notification after his electoral victory in November. "When he tweets, the market moves," she said. "Our users see this as an investment opportunity and a way for them to manage their portfolio risk." Trigger launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolios. Donald Trump's market-moving tweets are a huge scandal waiting to happen Michael Hiltzik An undercurrent of amusement has been detectable in some of the news coverage of Donald Trump’s recent market-moving tweets, as though it serves big companies right to have a few billions stripped off their market values because the president-elect is holding them to account. But it’s no laughing...

But it’s no laughing... (Michael Hiltzik) Mayer said company officials have long been interested in developing triggers for more nontraditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures such as Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is the company’s first foray into this realm, although they've been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as Rex Tillerson, Trump’s secretary of State nominee, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "Tweets really do matter," Mayer said.

Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand Oreo, was one of the companies that Donald Trump railed against during the campaign. But since then, the company hasn't had any run-ins with Trump.  (Richard Tsong-Taatarii / TNS)   By Craig GiammonaBloomberg Mon., Jan. 9, 2017 Hey, what about the Oreo? During the campaign, Mondelez International Inc., the owner of the iconic cookie brand, was one of the companies that President-elect Donald Trump railed against for sending jobs overseas, alongside the likes of Ford, Carrier and Boeing. But while those other three have already had Post-election run-ins with Trump in one fashion or another — triggering wild stock gyrations and corporate pledges to rework investment plans — Mondelez curiously has not. Given the president-elect’s current tweeting pace, it feels like it’s just a matter of time before the company comes back under scrutiny. Mondelez wasn’t interested in discussing its game plan for when that moment comes, but experts said it undoubtedly has scrambled to prepare a rapid-fire response. “The last thing they want to do is have a brand out there being attacked,” said Richard Frisch, a crisis-communications consultant. “There’s no question they have a crisis plan in place.” Article Continued Below The stakes are high. Last month, when Trump wrote on Twitter that the costs of the F-35 program were “out of control,” shares of defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp. tanked, wiping out almost $2 billion (U.S.) in market share. “We’ve never had a president-elect who could move stocks at will,” said Richard Levick, founder of the communications firm that bears his name. “A Trump tweet rates among the top risks of the year.” ‘Never Eat’ When a company makes nice, on the other hand, it can be rewarded. Ford Motor Co.’s stock rose nearly 4 per cent after it announced it was cancelling a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mondelez first drew Trump’s ire back in August 2015, when he claimed that the company was eliminating 1,200 jobs in the U.S. as it moved Oreo production to Mexico. “I’ll never eat them again,” Trump vowed. His assertion wasn’t quite true. The global snack giant had decided to invest $130 million in an existing plant south of the border to upgrade cookie and cracker production, rather than putting the money into a factory in Chicago. The move eliminated approximately 600 positions. Stephen Colbert Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton soon jumped on, too, and The Late Show’s Stephen Colbert mocked Trump’s vow not to eat Oreos by shovelling them into his mouth one night. But the controversy eventually faded into the background. Mondelez, which generates more than 70 per cent of its revenue outside North America, said it has invested about $450 million in U.S. manufacturing facilities since 2012, when the company split from Kraft Foods. The company still produces Oreos, the world’s top-selling cookie, at three domestic facilities. “We continue to make investments where it makes sense and that includes the United States,” said Laurie Guzzinati, a spokeswoman for the Deerfield, Illinois-based snack maker. She said the company hasn’t heard from the incoming administration. Mondelez might be better positioned than, say, Boeing Co. or Ford, to resist the pressure of a Trump tweet. It isn’t a big government contractor — making planes for the military, for instance — and getting consumers to boycott a favourite snack is difficult. That could weaken Trump’s ability to have a lasting negative impact on the $26.5 billion company, according to Frisch. Still, that may be little comfort. Large food companies tend to be conservative, perpetually seeking to stay away from controversy, particularly of the political variety. And in this unprecedented atmosphere, where the next squabble with the federal government is seemingly just a click away, Mondelez executives are hoping to avoid the glare of Trump’s aggressive Twitter persona. “If you’re Mondelez,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, “the last thing you want is to be a target of Donald Trump.” Read more about: Donald Trump, Twitter The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoMore By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing , but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence that planemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney . That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. Read More The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The program took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

Ends 2016 With a Surge of Orders 2016 was a slow year for aircraft orders, but Boeing still ended the year on a high note. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Jan 9, 2017 at 8:20AM In recent years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has frequently reported a flurry of order activity near the end of the year. For example, in 2015, the company brought in about 200 net orders during December, representing more than a quarter of its annual orders. The same dynamic played out again last month to an even greater extent. Just in the last week and a half of 2016, Boeing received nearly 200 net orders, helping it finish the year with a very respectable 668 net orders. Widebody demand remains weak In the past two years or so, demand for widebody aircraft has trailed off. To some extent, lower fuel prices have allowed airlines to extend the lives of older jets rather than investing in new widebody aircraft, which often cost more than $100 million each. Economic weakness in some parts of the world has also weighed on demand. This was reflected in weak order activity for Boeing's main widebody aircraft programs -- the 777 and 787 -- throughout 2016. Boeing ended the year with 58 net orders for the 787 and just 17 net orders for the 777. For comparison, those two programs combined for more than 600 orders in the 2013-2014 period. Sales of long-haul widebody aircraft have been sluggish lately. Image source: The Motley Fool. There was no year-end order rush, either. In its final sales update, Boeing reported just six new orders for the 787 Dreamliner and none for any of its other widebody models. Moreover, those six orders were more than offset by the formal cancellation of Delta Air Lines' order for 18 Dreamliners. The Boeing 737 shines again By contrast, Boeing grew the backlog for its popular 737 model once again in 2016. For the full year, it garnered 550 net orders for the 737, nearly all for the new 737 MAX version that is scheduled to enter service this spring. Meanwhile, Boeing delivered 490 737s during 2016. As a result, the 737 order backlog increased to 4,452 units at year-end. This is equivalent to nine years of production at last year's pace, or about seven years of output after accounting for three scheduled production increases. Of Boeing's 550 net orders for the 737, 210 (or 38%) were finalized in the last week and a half of the year. The vast majority of these orders went to undisclosed customers. The only major order announcement was that GECAS, the aircraft leasing arm of General Electric, will buy another 75 737 MAX 8s. GECAS now has 170 outstanding orders for the 737 MAX. The 737 will keep Boeing steady Boeing faces a lot of uncertainty over the next few years. The company will dramatically slash production of the 777 as it transitions to the next-generation 777X between now and 2020. In 2016, Boeing delivered 99 777s; it would be lucky to deliver that many in 2018 and 2019 combined. Boeing has more breathing room on the 787. While order activity has been slow for the last three years, Boeing still has a backlog of 700 Dreamliner orders. However, if it continues to average about 60 net orders per year for the 787 (as it has recently), Boeing would have to cut production in the early 2020s. In this context, the 737 has become more important than ever for Boeing. Even in the current slow order environment, the 737 is still selling well. This should give investors confidence that Boeing will be able to execute its planned production rate increases, which will raise output of the 737 from 42 a month to 57 in the next three years. The 737 production increases will drive rising cash flow between now and 2020. This will help offset the 777 program's eroding cash flow during that period. Boeing will then be in good position to benefit if widebody sales recover near the end of the decade as expected.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) SEATTLE (The Seattle Times/TNS) - Boeing delivered 748 jets last year, fourteen fewer than in 2015, but still enough to leave it well ahead of rival Airbus in 2016 production. However, overall sales for the year slumped despite a year-end rush that saw it book 202 net orders in December, according to data released Friday. Boeing’s final 2016 tally was 668 net orders, exactly one hundred fewer jets sold than in the previous year. In a message to employees Friday, the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAlister, discussed a series of milestones achieved during the year. He cited the first flight of the 737 MAX and its international debut at the Farnborough Airshow in England; the delivery of the five hundredth 787 Dreamliner and in South Carolina the start of final assembly of the latest Dreamliner model, the 787-10; and the opening of the 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, Wash. At list prices, the total value of Boeing’s 2016 net orders would be $94 billion. According to market pricing data from aircraft valuation firm Avitas, the real value after standard sales discounts is estimated at about $44 billion. The fact that the 668 jet sales total lags the 748 jet delivery total means that Boeing’s backlog of unfilled orders drops by eighty, the first time it’s fallen in seven years. Airbus won’t release its corresponding order and delivery figures until later this week, but as of the end of November its deliveries lagged Boeing’s by more than 100 jets, so it’s clear that it won’t match the U.S. plane-maker’s output. Airbus has struggled this year to meet its planned deliveries, beset by issues with the supply of Pratt & Whitney engines for its new A320neo jets and also with shortages of seats and other cabin interior parts. Of the planes Boeing delivered last year, 490 were the smaller 737 narrow-body jets assembled in Renton, Washington. Of the 258 larger wide-body jets Boeing built, the Everett plant assembled 197, including 99 large 777 twin-engine jets, 13 mid-size 767s and 76 all-composite 787 Dreamliners. The slight dip in overall production compared to 2015 was largely due to the rate cut in the 747 jumbo jet program. Boeing in 2016 delivered only nine 747s, exactly half the number delivered the previous year. Boeing’s assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C., built 61 Dreamliners, according to Uresh Sheth, who tracks 787 production on the “All Things 787” blog. That means the South Carolina site is running at its full planned rate, building five 787s per month to Everett’s seven per month for a current total of 12 Dreamliners per month. Boeing had said it was considering going up to 14 Dreamliners per month toward the end of the decade, with seven jets built at each site, but lack of new sales now makes that unlikely. Indeed, several analysts, including industry observer Scott Hamilton, believe Boeing may have to drop the production rate back down to 10 Dreamliners per month. If that happens, it’s likely Boeing will balance production with five jets made at each assembly site — meaning that North Charleston maintains its current rate while Everett loses two jets per month. The outlook for 2017 is gloomier for Everett production and also projected sales. Boeing will cut 777 production in Everett this year in response to slow sales of the current model ahead of the debut of the replacement 777X. It will deliver nearly thirty fewer of the expensive big jets than last year. In contrast, Renton should see more work, with a planned rate hike on the 737 to forty-seven jets per month from the current forty-two per month. Airplane sales in 2017 are expected to continue at a low level as the airline industry worldwide faces a capacity glut. Yet, there will be important milestones for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the year ahead. In his employee message, McAlister said he’s looking forward to the first 737 MAX delivery, the MAX 8 model, as well as the rollout and first flight of two new airplane models, the 737 MAX 9 and 787-10.

Currently Uzbekistan Havo Yollari uses two airplanes of Boeing-787-8 modification. The airline received them in August and November 2016. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It seats 250 to 330 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company’s most fuel-efficient airliner and the world’s first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction. According to Boeing, the 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. Subscribe to our Telegram channel to keep in touch with latest news.

The agency has booked a total of six flights each from the companies starting in 2018. Credit: NASA NASA has booked more astronaut flights to the International Space Station aboard private space taxis built by Boeing and SpaceX. The new orders, which NASA announced Tuesday (Jan. 3), awards four crew rotation flights to the International Space Station (ISS) each to Boeing and SpaceX as part of the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. The award increases the total number of flights ordered from each contractor to six, NASA officials wrote in the announcement. These missions will be approved to fly after NASA certification, and will not include payments at this time. [SpaceX's Crewed Dragon Spaceship in Pictures] "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a statement. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program." The news comes as both SpaceX and Boeing are preparing for their first crewed flight tests in 2018. Under the current schedule, SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will fly an uncrewed mission in November, and then launch a crewed test flight in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner is scheduled to fly its first uncrewed test flight in June 2018, which will be followed by a crewed flight later in August of next year. Estimated flight dates have been pushed back several times before, however. Each vehicle will carry up to four astronauts and 220 lbs. (100 kilograms) of cargo to the ISS. They can also serve as "lifeboats" to bring astronauts back to Earth in the event of an emergency. [In Pictures: Boeing's CST-100 Starliner] Since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011, the agency has had to depend on buying seats aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which launch from Kazakhstan, to fly American astronauts to the space station. NASA currently has contracts with Russia's Roscosmos space agency to fly astronauts on six Soyuz flights in 2017 (for a total of $458 million). The agency will also pay Roscosmos another $490 million to fly astronauts on six more flights in 2018. Would you take a ride on SpaceX's Dragon space capsule? Yes - It would be the ride of a lifetime. Sign me up! No - It's a step backward from the reusable space plane design of the space shuttles. Maybe - I would wait a while for it to be proven safe. Get Results Share This NASA's Commercial Crew Program aims to restart crewed launches from American soil in 2018. Another long-range goal is to increase the crew size on the space station. Russia's Soyuz vehicles can only carry up to three people at a time. The Dragon and Starliner vehicles, by contrast, are designed to carry up to seven astronauts per flight. With more astronauts on the space station, NASA plans to increase the research time available on the orbiting complex. In recent years, observers have also expressed concerns about relying on a foreign government to send Americans to the space station, especially when political disputes occurred between Russia and the United States. Further, Russia is dependent on agreements with Kazakhstan for its Soyuz launches. Both Boeing and SpaceX will launch from facilities near Orlando, Florida. SpaceX's crewed Dragon spacecraft will leave Earth from Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The two companies have been upgrading human space transportation facilities in Florida to support these missions, from what was used during the space shuttle program.

Photo: Bloomberg Boeing Co on Friday said that its deliveries of commercial planes fell modestly last year and it saw fewer orders compared with 2015. The US aerospace giant delivered 748 planes last year, down from 762 in 2015. Boeing booked orders for 668 planes, down 13 percent in from orders in 2015. Last year’s orders are worth US$94.1 billion at list prices, it said. Boeing’s rival Airbus Group SE in November last year said that it was targeting deliveries of 670 planes for the year. Commercial airplane deliveries are tied to revenues and are closely monitored as a sign of financial strength. Boeing’s most popular plane, the single-aisle 737, comprised about two-thirds of the deliveries and an even higher percentage of the orders. The company on Wednesday announced a new order for 75 of the 737s, worth US$8.25 billion, from General Electric Co’s airplane leasing arm. However, deliveries of the iconic 747 jumbo jets fell by half to just nine. The company announced in January last year that it was cutting production of the planes in half due to weak demand in the cargo market. Airbus has also faired badly with its jumbo offering, the A380. Boeing last month said it also was cutting production of its wide-body 777 planes to five from seven due to slackening demand. It delivered 99 of the planes last year, up one from the prior year. Shares of Boeing rose 0.1 percent to US$158.87 on Friday. This story has been viewed 1896 times. Comments will be moderated.

It shows a Boeing Clipper flying boat, surely one of the most beautiful and romantic passenger airplanes ever built, taking off from Elliott Bay with Seattle’s familiar skyline in the background. Yet something’s not right. It’s a composite photo. The flying boat was photographed in Elliott Bay in 1941; the skyscrapers behind were snapped in 2013 and replace the much less imposing original Seattle backdrop. It’s clever because this is a book of historical photos — the images inside are undoctored — that’s organized by geography. Author Tim Nelson sets out to connect for readers a fascinating catalog of bygone aviation events with their precise location in the modern city and beyond. A full-time Boeing engineer who compiled the book as a labor of love, Nelson invites readers to follow his wandering along the roads of Seattle and Washington state and to find the spots where the book’s fascinating historical photos were taken. Most Popular 1 S.A. anchorwoman Evy Ramos said she was fired from WOAI-TV 2 Popovich handles Trump question in Mexico 3 NWS: Tornadoes, thunderstorms and heavy rain possible this... Some of the locations — Boeing Field, the Museum of Flight, Paine Field in Everett — are familiar to every airplane enthusiast. Others are more obscure, because little outward sign remains of a remarkable past: For example, the site of the Meadows racetrack where, on March 11, 1910, the first airplane flight in state history took off, is now occupied by Raisbeck Aviation High School.Nelson says he was motivated to pull the book together in part when Boeing’s historic Plant 2 — where during peak production in 1944, Boeing cranked out 16 B-17 bombers on a single April day — was demolished in 2010. “The realization hit me that a lot of these sites of very significant local history were not permanent,” said Nelson in an interview. And so he cataloged the state’s aviation firsts and their locations, and dug up photos of both then and now. Stand at the little pier that’s the northernmost tip of West Seattle and close your eyes to re-create Nelson’s photos of the old Luna Park, an early 20th-century Coney Island-style amusement park, and of the day in June 1908 when a huge football-shaped dirigible took the first semi-controlled human flight in the state, ending with a splash into Elliott Bay. More Information Jet City Rewind: Aviation History of Seattle and the Pacific Northwest By Tim Nelson Schiffer, $29.99 He pinpoints the row of attractive residential houseboats on the edge of Lake Union that’s the location of the hangar where Bill Boeing built the first Boeing airplanes 100 years ago. The Gorst Air Transport terminal at one of Seattle’s downtown piers — from where in the 1930s passengers flew in six-seater amphibious biplanes across Puget Sound to Bremerton — is now the site of an Ivar’s restaurant. And the decidedly prosaic A-1 Pallets company in the Kent Valley stands where Herb Munter in the 1920s established an airfield on a Green River cow pasture for charter and photography flights, including the first flight over Mount Rainier. Here, as in some other places listed in the book, Nelson is unfortunately forced to write that “no aviation traces remain.” Yet that serves to highlight the book’s contribution to local history. Its fabulous photos vividly render the ghost of this Jet City’s vanished past.

The blacked-out information includes dollar figures and engine specifications for the Denton Energy Center — as well as how much noise and pollution it will make. 1 of 2 DME says details of city’s $265M plant deal would boost competition By Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe Peggy Heinkel-Wolfe Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer pheinkel-wolfe@dentonrc.com Published: 07 January 2017 11:33 PM When city officials unveiled the most expensive capital project in Denton’s history last fall, they didn’t disclose any details to the public. And it looks like they never will. Denton Municipal Electric, the city’s electric department, is building a power plant on the city’s west side. We know some things. For example, the Denton Energy Center will have 12 natural-gas fired engines built by Wärtsilä, a Finnish company. A Missouri engineering firm, Burns & McDonnell, will design and supervise construction of the building that houses them. DME is part of the city government and much of its debt is backed by Denton taxpayers. Even so, DME’s position is that the public cannot be told the most basic information about the deal it made on the public’s behalf. Currently, the public has no way of finding out how much city government is paying Wärtsilä. They cannot know how much Denton is paying Burns & McDonnell, either. The Denton Energy Center is expected to cost $265 million or more. The only reason that figure is publicly available is because state law requires certain disclosures when a city issues bonds to finance a project. DME officials say disclosing any more information about the new power plant would put them at a competitive disadvantage in the Texas electric marketplace. Another power plant could figure out DME’s costs and beat the energy center’s bids to sell electricity to the grid. Phil Williams, DME’s general manager, said most of the buying, selling and trading of electricity in Texas is done by private utilities. The Texas Legislature changed open records laws so municipal utilities wouldn’t have to show any more cards than private utilities do in the Texas electric market. Without exemptions in open records laws, those private companies could get information to undercut public utilities, like DME. “Otherwise, it’s not fair and we don’t have a level playing field,” Williams said.   Massive blackouts DME has used those exemptions to keep private the specific details of its major business dealings for many years. The “purchase power agreements” set terms when DME buys electricity from wind and solar farms. The agreements also include terms for selling electricity to large customers, such as the University of North Texas. Last fall, DME sought the City Council’s approval to build the Denton Energy Center. Officials redacted, or blacked out, more than dollar figures in its contracts with Wärtsilä and Burns & McDonnell. They redacted how much noise the plant will make and how much air pollution the plant will emit. After a deeply divided City Council voted 4-3 to approve the deal, the Denton Record-Chronicle asked for complete, unredacted copies of the city’s contracts. Other people asked for complete, unredacted copies, too, including a reporter who wanted to write on the groundbreaking deal for a trade publication. Another person asked how many people DME would hire to run the plant. DME’s attorney, John Knight, appealed to the Texas attorney general’s office. He claimed all the information people sought needed to be kept secret. He cited a controversial decision by the Texas Supreme Court in 2015, Boeing Co. vs. Paxton. The state’s highest court told Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office Port San Antonio and Boeing could shield their lease terms from public scrutiny. Boeing operates an aircraft maintenance hub at the Port San Antonio development on the site of the old Kelly Air Force Base. In the past 18 months, the Texas attorney general’s office has received more than 300 requests from governmental entities, like DME, looking to shield their contract terms from public scrutiny, too. DME’s power plant deal was similar, Knight said. He claimed the Boeing decision gave Wärtsilä, Burns & McDonnell and the other firms that bid (but lost) on the Denton Energy Center a chance to keep their information secret. Those secret bids were the only way DME could be sure it was getting the best deal for ratepayers, Williams said. Among the losing bidders, only General Electric asked to continue to keep its bid a secret. Wärtsilä and Burns & McDonnell asked that their bids and contract terms continue to be kept secret, even after the contracts were signed. The two firms have worked together on similar projects elsewhere in Texas and are likely to bid on more. The Texas attorney general’s office agreed the Boeing decision applied and sided with DME and the three companies. They said DME could keep the information secret: not only dollar figures, but also noise and emissions calculations. DME’s contracts to build and run the plant aren’t different from other purchase power agreements, Williams said. Moreover, the deals are scrutinized. Both the City Council and their appointees on the Public Utilities Board review the agreements on behalf of the public. “Fourteen individuals are aware of the details,” Williams said. So far, the Denton Energy Center and DME’s goals to buy more electricity from renewable sources are “on target,” Williams said. He expected construction of the power plant to cost less than $265 million once it is finished. In addition, even though the new plant won’t make electricity until 2018, the power plant deal helped DME negotiate its first wind power deal on better terms than expected, Williams said, adding more wind and solar deals are coming. DME officials say the new power plant will keep them in the driver’s seat — buying, selling and trading on their own terms, keeping rates low for customers in the future.   A two-headed DME DME is somewhere in between a private company and a government utility. It is increasingly different from the other 70-plus municipally owned electric utilities in Texas. Other municipalities employ a private utility to do their buying, selling and trading on the Texas grid. DME does its own trading. Williams and many other executives came to DME from TXU or other private-sector utilities. They created a special unit that can buy, sell and trade electricity in the Texas market. Williams said that unit already has saved millions for ratepayers in the two years it has operated. DME also has become increasingly secretive about its budget matters in the past two years. Last summer’s budget talks for the city-owned utility stayed behind closed doors. DME used to announce with pride its purchase of wind and solar power and how much closer it got the utility to its goal of 70 percent renewable energy by 2019. But no more. That’s now considered a competitive matter. An open-records activist asked how many people DME would hire to run the plant, but he was rebuffed. Even though they would be city employees, that number, too, was considered a competitive matter.   Closing Boeing loophole Until recently, Texas law was clear on the status of contract documents once bidding has ended and the contract is signed. Government contracts can be made available for public inspection. In addition, state law was clear that environmental impact information was not considered a competitive matter and had to be disclosed. That changed after the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in the Boeing case in June 2015. According to the Texas Tribune, secret deals emanating from the Boeing decision run the gamut. A Kaufman County school district kept secret the terms for a food service deal. The city of Houston won’t reveal how many permits it had issued to Uber drivers. And the city of McAllen didn’t have to say how much it paid Enrique Iglesias to sing at a holiday parade. Whether DME’s secret contract terms, ostensibly allowed by the Boeing decision, circumvent federal law by withholding environmental information is not clear. Williams said he knew that information would not typically have been redacted. Members of the Texas Legislature have already filed bills to close what critics call the “massive loopholes” created by the Boeing decision. In a press conference this week, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed two bills in each chamber to address the problems. One pair of bills, House Bill 792 and Senate Bill 407, would limit the threshold governments can use to withhold information when considering competitive matters. In addition, the legislation restores the biggest loss from the Boeing decision: Once a contract is finalized, it once again would become a public document. Another set of bills, House Bill 793 and Senate Bill 408, would make sure that private entities that receive public funds are subject to open records laws under certain circumstances. The next session of the Texas Legislature begins Tuesday.

Boeing had predicted orders would roughly match deliveries, which it forecast at between 745 and 750 planes. Boeing's delivery total means the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company is likely to have beaten European rival Airbus on output. Airbus had forecast at least 670 deliveries in 2016, and is due to reports totals on Wednesday. Investors watch orders closely to gauge future aircraft production levels and revenue, since airlines make most of the payment when aircraft are delivered. The final days of 2016 marked a busy time for Boeing's new sales chief Ihssane Mounir. The sales force booked 198 net new orders since December 20, including 189 orders from unidentified customers. The tally did not include any of its pending orders for Iran, the company said. The total included 194 orders worth about $21bn at list prices for Boeing's new narrowbody 737 MAX, which is scheduled to enter service next year. It also included an order for four 787 Dreamliners from Uzbekistan Airways Boeing had already disclosed a large part of the tally earlier in the week, when it said it booked 80 orders for its 737 MAX. The new tally lifts Boeing's total backlog to 5,715 commercial jets, equivalent to about seven years of production. The majority are single-aisle 737 planes. Sales of its more expensive widebodies such as the 777 and 787 remain sluggish.

Her comments were directed at President-elect Donald Trump's remarks about swapping out the Lockheed Martin fighter jet for cheaper models, notably Boeing's F/A-18. © AP Photo/ Paul Beaty Boeing CEO Promises Trump Air Force One Will Be Less Than $4B The Air Force needs the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the A-10 Warthog, two polarizing but indispensable planes, she told Defense News. "The Air Force does not view the F/A-18 and the F-35 to be substitutable at all," she said. "They fulfill different requirements." Trump in December tweeted, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" That would be comparing "apples and oranges," James told an Air Force Association breakfast, Defense One reported. "It does not fulfill the same requirements," she said about the older F/A-18. "It's a very fine fourth-generation fighter. The F-35 is an extremely fine fifth-generation fighter…It's a cut above anything the pilots have seen before and we need it and we want it in the inventory." © Flickr/ mashleymorgan Lockheed Martin Awarded $450Mln to Produce F-35 Combat Jets for South Korea Trump has also tweeted about F-35 costs being "out of control." The program, which has been criticized on both sides of the aisle for delays, cost overruns and performance failures, is expected to cost $400 billion over the next few years, more than double the initial estimate. This makes it the Pentagon's most expensive program, CNN Money pointed out. Trump's tweets are viewed as negotiating tactics intended to get both of the massive munitions manufacturers to offer better deals. Trump has said he intends to negotiate directly with Boeing on the costs of operating Air Force One, for example. But as far as the Air Force is concerned, the F-35s are "crucial" and "performing magnificently," according to James. "The leaders of the Air Force will have the opportunity when the time comes to advise the president-elect on this," James told Defense News. "But based on everything I know, the two are not interchangeable and the Air Force has not expressed interest in the F/A-18s." She also defended postponing the retirement of the A-10 Warthog, an aging plane that has been subject to sunsetting suggestions for the past two years. Its fortunes have been saved by the need for slow, low-flying planes that can withstand ground fire to support troops. © Flickr/ Dmitry Terekhov Russian Su-35 May be Last Fighter Jet Imported by China as Beijing Bets on Homemade J-20 "Our feeling about the A-10 is that we would suggest certainly delaying the retirement," James said, according to Defense One. "It's been extremely helpful in the fight overseas against [Daesh] as well as for presence in the Pacific and in Europe." The Air Force has said budget constraints led to its original plan to retire the A-10. Eventually, it and other old planes will have to be grounded to free up funding for new projects, James said. But for now, hands off our planes, was the message. ...

Reply cast235 05:38 08.01.2017 | -1 | Edit | Delete The A 10 could be modernized with NO NONSENSE modernized equipment. Why the A 10 needs to be like an F 22? NO. It could be modernized in it's role ONLY. without POTATO PEELERS. The F35 have different functions and should be good at it. And NOT many countries have capabilities against an F 35. Mostly those that can try something are U.S PUPPETS that MUST do as they told. But yes. Eliminating some costs is good. The SILENT F15 could compare in many areas with the F 35. Of course NOT remotely in many areas. But could play a good alternative, while the F35 is real ready. Giving F35 to Israel was a GIANT STUPIDITY. NO ONE but maybe IRAN and Russia can challenge it. Unfortunately the MESS against Russia is all to get TRUMP to be enemy of Russia. Now CLINTON is completely out of the W.H equation. And about the PLAN to challenge TRUMP at congress, be ready for disappointments. He NO POLITICIAN, and is NOT against congress. But have an ARMY of advisers about how to tackle it. Best be ready for NEGOTIATIONS. But TRUMP is RIGHT!! That plane is TOO expensive. I'll probe it against a flu of misappropriations,. I mean, it goes UP yearly!!! ONLY Obama;s FORMULA to calculate COLA said there was no inflation. Otherwise, F 35 costs should be as high as 6 years AGO.

But does China have the new 'S' variant they are entirely two different planes if China reversed engineered the latest variant they would have a world beater that US could not produce under 100 million. The big questions is do they have the 'S' variant? which has a newly developed engine and the latest 6th gen avionics and sensors plus stealth modifications and coatings on plane. As far as i'm aware Russia was to supply a small batch with mixed specs and strict conditions subject to massive penalties for licensing infringement. Reply support 09:28 08.01.2017 | -1 | Edit | Delete Politics aside, IMO the programme can be retrieved and put back into the black all the way around if, as with the WW 2 era F4U Corsair carrier aircraft programme and the equally troublesome Phantom II F4D programme, eight things are done: 1. Kick out the "innovators" through what is known as locking in or freezing the design then conduct changeover of engineering staff to reliability and QC/QA reliability engineers; 2. Re-source the project "bridge money" (cash on hand used to finance building the prototypes and production units to cover the time from order to the time of completion and subsequent billing) thereby kicking the moneychangers out of the government procurement temple. The US taxpayer is paying for the project money through using bank financing close to four times over in interest and flotation fees; 3. As with the Osprey and other aviation and othe rnaval power plant projects, switch over to marinized Rolls Royce power plants from Pratt & Whitney and/or GE; 4. On corrective action procedures for sorting out defective design elements, break that function down into small teams who all are accountable to one perpetually angry person (at Hughes Aircraft Tucson, it was the Man In Black whose name you need not know but he got the job done) Every Russian aviation and military contractor performs their work under th einfluence of one person and the company bears that person's name. This is but one of those reasons why it is done that way. Personalized design bureaus work through giving the workers a focus in the same way churches strengthen through having popes. bishops and Grand Metropolitans; 5. End sole sourcing of anything. Always put procurement out for competitive bid; and 6. The government should always own free an dclear the final design of the aircraft not the vendor. 7. Penalties for test pilot deaths owing to design flaws are not enforced. They must be or no one will take the Feds seriously. Wives of test pilots do not want money in lieu of their husbands, they want their husbands alive or at least justice if their husbands are murdered by negligent design. 8. DCAS and DCAA should be re-consolidated back into one auditing agency, the Defense Contract Audit Systems Management Agency. It worked, it was nimble, it was agile, cost-controlling, responsive and for the most part met all programme goals, whatever project it took on. Making two separate agencies out of one was and is a complete failure in this instance and is the prime source of unsupervised "Why did we do that?" types of design and manufacturing errors. The above is how the F4U Corsair and the Phantom II F4D were sorted out, also AMRAAM, TV Maverick, the Harpoon and the Patriot missle's safe-arm device problems. The real problem is that there is no such degree'd discipline called "military engineering financial history & administrative history" IMO. Reply ivanwa88 09:32 08.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete What F-35 is supposed to do is link with Aegis radar and missiles to give particularly smaller nations capability to wage a major missile attack from Aegis anywhere within range whether from land sea or air utilizing any missile firing facility in NATO. That's what she really means which is a highly politicized position for her to take she is in essence batting for NATO. Incidentally a new promo video was released last week with these features mentioned in detail. So it will really come down to whether Trump wants to support NATO in what would be a irreversibly powerful position over the world and once smaller nations have this power can it be controlled for world peace and a multi power sharing or will it serve only NATO aligned nations against the rest meaning we are back to square one and WW3 will be between the 23 NATO aligned nations and the rest of the world? Trump must scrap this plane. Reply megargy 10:32 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete James is just protecting her future salary ! Reply support 10:56 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete As an hilarious aside, how Hughes Aircraft financed its purchase orders was by using their own money so that they could directly pocket the interest earned at the allowable prime rate. Their financial clout came from residuals from RKO Pictures, patents and proprietary intellectual property licenced out under trademark law, Hughes Tool diamond-tipped oil well drillhead sales, and other in-house resources. Also, like Chrysler and others, they asked for no money from the Feds suring WW 2 but only the right to call in the debt owed to them by the Federal government at some future date. Hughes Aircraft did not have to call in that marker until the Feds busted up Hughes Medical into a separate non-ownership vehicle in the mid-1980's. In effect, Hughes war production was a money-losing but necessary tax write-off so that Hughes could pocket their earnings from other industries. Lockheed needs to change their business model and become a bit more syncretic in their structure. Maybe they should buy Lionsgate Studios lol It is always stupid to finance purchase orders using othe rpeople's money unless you use a factor charging a one-time 7 points of simple interest. The financial company ends up owning your manufacturing plant which they will then crash into a few trees at high speed then sell off the scrap parts to competitors for cash. That is what is happening to Lockheed. This has already happened to General Electric. I hope all of Jeff Immelt's engineers quit to work for Siemens, Doosan Babcock, Rolls Royce and Magellan Aerospace. Canada, the UK, France and Germany are more pro-American than General Electric of Schenectady, NY.

Outgoing presidents traditionally are allowed one final flight on the famed blue-and-white aircraft. President George W. Bush used it to fly to Midland, Texas, with his wife and family just after Obama was inaugurated. The Obamas plan to continue living in Washington in a rented home after leaving the White House. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest says the Obamas will still leave Washington by plane shortly after Trump's inaugural ceremony. No word yet on where they're heading. Although the plane will be the same, technically it won't be Air Force One. That designation is used only when the sitting president is on board. One more flight: The Obamas had been thought to have to taken their last family trip on Air Force one on January 2, when they returned from Hawaii, but will ride on the presidential plane again on January 20  Bushes say goodbye: George W. Bush used his final flight after leaving office to take his wife Laura, mother Barbara and father, former president George H.W. Bush, to Midland, Texas Start of a new journey: The Clintons were not leaving public life completely when they landed at JFK, New York, on board a VC-25 as Hillary Clinton was starting her life as junior senator from the state The plane will be one of the AIr Force's two - identical - modified Boeing 747s, which are known as VC-25s. It is a perk which every president has spoken of their love for flying on the plane. a symbol of both presidential office and American technological power. Obama said of it in one of his weekly radio addresses shortly before the election: 'I’m going to be honest with you – one of the best parts of being President is having your own plane.  'And I’m going to miss it. A lot.' Until the Monday announcement it had seemed likely that the final flight of the Obamas would be their return from the family's Hawaiian Christmas and New Year vacation. Their younger daughter, Sasha, is a student at Sidwell Friends School in the capital and is likely to have school as normal on the Monday after the Obamas leave the White House. Their new rented home is in Kalorama, just two miles from their current one in the White House residence. The right to a final flight had, of course, been used by other departing presidents. In 2009, George W Bush took a Marine helicopter flight to Andrews Air Force base with his wife Laura, and his parents - former president George H.W. Bush and former first lady, Barbara.

Hillary Clinton had just won her first election to become the junior senator for New York. Her re-election in 2006 was her second and final election victory. And in 1989, Ronald Reagan flew from Andrews to Point Mugu Naval Air Station near the Simi Valley home to where he and Nancy retired. Unusually for inauguration day, the incoming First Family are also losing the use of their plane, in this case Donald Trump's personalized Boeing 757. Although the narrow-bodied jet is significantly smaller than a 747, it is likely to prove a step down in terms of luxury. Trump will have to give up his personalized decor in favor of that of Air Force One - leaving behind his gold-plated seatbelt with the Trump crest. However he will gain access to an in-flight hospital staffed with military medical personnel, and anti-missile technology, in-flight refueling and a senior Air Force officer at the controls at all times.

EVERETT — Aviation buffs are in for a treat this week with the opening of a new exhibition at the Schack Art Center. Retired Boeing designer Robert Parks has combined his life’s work with his artistic passion to offer an exhibit in the Schack’s loft gallery — Historic Aircraft Profiles — which includes dozens of colorful and detailed drawings and paintings of planes. Displayed in the main gallery will be more than 50 paintings by Everett artist Chris Hopkins from his series on the famed Tuskegee Airmen. The Schack’s show — “Red Tails, Silver Wings” — opens with a reception from 5 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the art center, 2921 Hoyt Ave. Admission is free. Parks, 90, of Shoreline, will be on hand to talk about his time in the Army Air Forces during World War II, his long career with Boeing and his lifelong interest in aviation. Parks’ name is on the Wall of Honor at the National Air and Space Museum at the Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport for his contributions to aviation. Hopkins, 63, also an Air Force veteran, began his Tuskegee project as part of the Air Force Art Program. A number of paintings from the series are hung permanently in the Pentagon. The paintings illustrate the heroism and ground-breaking work of the country’s first African-American military pilots. “Black Aviation through World War II” is the title of a lecture at the Schack to be presented at 7 p.m. Friday by Hopkins and his friend and fellow Air Force vet Guy E. Franklin, who has written extensively about the Tuskegee Airmen. The lecture is open to the public, with a suggested donation of $5 at the door.

Fairchild Air Force Base has lost out again in its bid to host the new generation of aerial refueling tankers, the KC-46A pictured here. (U.S. Air Force graphic) By Jim Camden jimc@spokesman.com(360) 664-2598 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS If you go The U.S. Air Force EIS scoping meeting for bringing a wing of new KC-46As to Fairchild is set for 5-8 p.m. Thursday at the Lincoln Center, 1316 N. Lincoln St. Financial impact sizable The local economic benefits of landing the new base is substantial: The impact statement for the first round of base selection estimated a $292 million boost to the Spokane economy from construction and additional personnel. Spokane’s second chance at convincing the Pentagon to send the nation’s new aerial tanker to Fairchild Air Force Base marks a major milestone Thursday evening when military experts come to town for a special hearing. The Air Force has scheduled an Environmental Impact Statement scoping meeting to estimate the costs and benefits of putting the new KC-46A tankers at Fairchild sometime after 2020, when the military will need a second active-duty home for the new planes. Fairchild, currently home to KC-135 tankers built in the 1950s and 1960s, was a finalist to be the base to get the first 36 Pegasus tankers being built by Boeing in Washington. It lost that competition in late 2013 when the final analysis concluded renovations needed to handle the new plane would cost less at McConnell Air Force Base, and the Kansas facility was closer to more bases with planes that need to be refueled. Last year, the Air Force announced Fairchild was on the short list for the second such facility, known as Main Operating Base 4. Also on the list are Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, Travis Air Force Base in California, Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. Grand Forks was also on the list as a possible first home for the KC-46A, but Fairchild scored higher in that competition. The Delaware base, which is the home to large transport planes, and the California and New Jersey bases, which are currently home to the KC-10 tankers the Air Force would like to retire, are new for this round of considerations. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., one of the driving forces behind securing a new tanker for the Air Force, has also been a long-time advocate of putting the earliest ones to roll off the assembly line in Everett at Fairchild, the nation’s closest base to operations in the Pacific and Asia. “Between its location, infrastructure and community support, there’s no doubt to me that Fairchild is the best possible pick of the five potential sites,” Murray said Friday in a statement released by her staff. “But as I’ve expressed directly to the Secretary of the Air Force, I’m gravely concerned that this round of the process has been not only opaque but deeply flawed, and I am actively working in Congress to ensure we right this wrong.” Murray protested when the list of bases being considered for the second round of tankers was expanded to include those housing KC-10s. Those two bases are located in populous and politically influential New Jersey and California. In announcing the hearings, the Air Force said it would be studying “operational requirements, potential impacts to existing missions, housing, infrastructure and manpower.” The local economic benefits of landing the new base is substantial: The impact statement for the first round of base selection estimated a $292 million boost to the Spokane economy from construction and additional personnel.

The Flying Heritage Collection’s M55 self-propelled gun is a local hero of sorts. The machine was built by Pacific Car and Foundry Company (PACCAR), right here in Washington State. The company began by making logging equipment and railroad cars in West Seattle in 1905. During World War II, PACCAR grew substantially, supplying metal for ships, bridges, buildings, highways, and even for Boeing-built B-17 bombers. Familiarity with trucks and heavy steel made PACCAR a great candidate to make tanks. They built around 900 M4A1 Sherman tanks during the war and supplied parts for many more. The Flying Heritage Collection’s Sherman tank, built in Chicago, contains a few components cast with the “circle P” of PACCAR. The company also made two 95-ton T28 super heavy tanks. By Korea, PACCAR was a prime military contractor, building both M53 and M55 self-propelled guns, including the FHC’s M55. PACCAR is still around today, of course. It is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of heavy and medium duty trucks including both Kenworth and Peterbilt. Cory Graff is the military aviation curator at Flying Heritage Collection.

This change is part of an integrated and holistic program in which the company has launched in line with its technical advancements in the aerospace industry. Alsalam has progressed from its core capabilities of the maintenance, repair modification and upgrade of aircraft to the assembly of military aircraft and the manufacture of major military components. Alsalam Aerospace Industries was established in 1988 under the Saudi Economic Offset Program to develop the aviation industry in the Kingdom and establish self-sufficiency in commercial and military aircraft maintenance, repair, modification and upgrade. With Allah’s blessing, the steadfast support of the Ministry of Defense, and the Royal Saudi Air Force, Alsalam has developed its technical and non-technical capabilities and established itself as a regional leader and the Kingdom’s premier provider of aerospace products and services for military and commercial aircraft. Alsalam has deep and long lasting relations with the Saudi Armed Forces and in particular the Royal Saudi Air Force, other defense and security services and strategic manufacturing partners headed by The Boeing Company To celebrate this key milestone in Alsalam›s history, the Chairman of Alsalam Aerospace Industries Ibrahim Bin Ali Bin Musallam, has announced that «the decision to change the company›s name followed extending our technical capabilities to include aircraft assembly and manufacturing … the first product of our new advanced capabilities, the conversion of an RSAF F‑15S to F‑15SA configuration using F-15SA wing assemblies and forward fuselages manufactured by Alsalam, has been completed at our facilities in Riyadh, making Saudi Arabia only one of two countries outside the US with this capability. This is not only a tremendous boost to the company›s confidence but also completely aligns Alsalam with the rapid development of our beloved country and the Kingdom›s vision under Saudi Arabia Vision 2030. Bin Musallam added «this phase is a defining and turning point in Alsalam›s progress and a paradigm shift in the aircraft industry in the Kingdom. It makes us incredibly proud and gives us great confidence in the capabilities of our national talent, especially our technicians and engineers, who are integral to developing the company›s capabilities. He further said «on behalf of our Board of Directors and executive management, I would like to thank the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques (King Salman), for the good governance that has provided outstanding support for the development of national capabilities that led us to delivering excellence.» The President and Chief Executive Officer of Alsalam Aerospace Industries Yahya Bin Hamoud Al Ghoraibi said changing the company name, introducing the new corporate brand identity and transforming the company to include manufacturing reflects our continuous efforts to develop the aircraft industry in the Kingdom. He emphasized that «In our pursuit of good governance, we will not stop with just the change in our company name, we will take advantage of every opportunity to increase our abilities, review our internal policies and processes, and strengthen our relationships with our strategic partners. Moreover; most of all we will develop our national talent base and attract young Saudi who have ambition and relevant skill sets. We will train, develop, and qualify them to contribute not only to Alsalam›s diverse activities but to ensure progress in our sector and our contribution to our beloved country. Al Ghoraibi also lauded the long and solid partnership and support Alsalam Aerospace Industries has received from the Ministry of Defense and the Royal Saudi Air Force who believe in the importance of developing national capabilities.

"The rotational deployment of Apache helicopters is a demonstration of strong US will in implementing its security commitments," US Army Col. Rob Manning said recently. The move is expected to "significantly strengthen" military capabilities aimed at deterring North Korea’s leaders from maliciously launching an intercontinental ballistic missile, the colonel added. The fleet of Apaches expands the capabilities of the United States Forces Korea to include eliminating ground vehicle targets, hovercraft, and special operations units in North Korea, according to Kim Sung-min, a South Korean defense ministry official. The Boeing-manufactured Apaches usually pack a mix of air-to-surface "fire and forget" Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. Pyongyang attempted to stir the pot Sunday when North Korea’s foreign ministry department stated "the US is wholly to blame" for the development of its missiles. Pentagon Defense Secretary Ashton Carter noted that the US would neutralize any missiles launched from North Korea directed at the US or an ally.

A spokesman for the DPRK promised that ICBMS may be fired "anytime and anywhere" as the "supreme" headquarters of the DPRK sees fit.

"[Investigators] are calling it a tailpipe fire," Brig. Gen Scott Pleus, director of the F-35 integration program at the Air Force, said regarding a September, 2016, F-35 fire. Fuel collected near the back of the airplane and ignited before the plane took off, he noted. Engine mishaps and faulty cooling wires are just two in a long list of woes for the F-35, but the latest problems indicate an entirely new defect, unrelated to the aircraft’s previous failures. The saga of F-35 technicians putting out one fire after another carries on, almost as if by tradition.   An F-35 fire in October 2016 led US military services to indefinitely ground over a dozen of the fighter jets. The faulty coolant system that caused the October incident, was, Pleus noted, a matter of human error. "They put the wrong insulation in," Pleus added, referring to the subcontractor tasked with the installation, whose name has has not been disclosed by military officials. Nevertheless, it’s hard not to be shocked that a simple loose bracket could lead to potential fire damage of the jets, which generate around $100 million in revenue apiece for the publicly-traded, defense multinational corporation Lockheed Martin. © Flickr/ Airman Magazine CEO Tells Trump Lockheed Martin Committed to Cut Cost of F-35 Program The $1.45 trillion projected to be spent over the lifecycle of the F-35 has been hailed as an upgrade over the F-16, as one of just two operational fifth-generation fighters, alongside the F-22 Raptor. But the program, which has received more funding than the US development of the atomic bomb, has no shortage of critics. In 11 days, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in, ushering in a new era of how the US buys weapons, planes, and much more. Harnessing Twitter, Trump’s tweet disparaging Boeing over "out of control" costs to build a 747 airliner to be fitted for service as a new Air Force One sent the company’s stock plummeting almost five percent, before rebounding later that day. Trump, a self-branded "dealmaker," met with top executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, just days before Christmas. "It’s a dance, you know," Trump told reporters in between meetings. While he did not commit to any concrete results, he did say that F-35 costs will be lowered and that "we’re going to do it beautifully."  © AP Photo/ Paul Beaty Boeing CEO Promises Trump Air Force One Will Be Less Than $4B Trump, alongside almost every US lawmaker, has complained about the cost of the F-35 program. Following meetings with Boeing and Lockheed executives, Trump stated that he would request that Boeing produce a proposal for a "comparable" F/A-18 Super Hornet due to “the tremendous cost and cost overruns” associated with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Trump’s tweet seems to align with a strategy detailed by the Congressional Budget Office recommending that adding high-tech versions of older F-16s and F/A-18s could reduce costs 29 percent over the next ten years.  ...

In other words it does the job of a special forces target acquisition party behind enemy lines hence the requirement for stealth features. Of course it does a lot more than a target spotter can do! its real persona is as a joint power house for smaller nations who can act as though they are a super power. With this knowledge it connects with Obama's aggressive stance to place Aegis in Poland and Romania and heavily provoke around Russian and Iranian waters as the system is powerless if Aegis stations and ships are not within striking range. The other major flaw of the plane is that its stealth has been countered by advanced radar planes and missiles developed whilst the F-35 was delayed nearly a decade making it effectively a 'lame duck' to any advanced nation with Russian standards in Radar and missiles not withstanding it needs extensive escort by fighters to protect the plane which means stealth which is an absolute requirement for operational success is non-existent. It would be a absolute BS sham to continue with the plane it is a Dodo a dinosaur only good to attack third world countries.

Later in time is when you stand your ground, but for now, give him the easy victory lap.” Trump, known for late-night emotional and aggressive tweets to his more than 6 million followers, is “the main enterprise risk” facing business in 2017, says Levick. Publicly traded companies need to burn any standard crisis handbook because this is unprecedented. “The best you can do is use your peace time wisely. What we’re seeing here, and this is remarkable, the president-elect has the ability to impact stock with the single use of two thumbs. He really has extraordinary powers and companies have to anticipate that now.” Levick advises corporations, countries and institutions around the world and has spearheaded some huge communications campaigns, including Guantanamo Bay, the Catholic Church, the Wall Street crisis, and the Gulf oil spill. He says companies have to be prepared to find themselves in Trump’s crosshairs because, in today’s digital landscape, they might only have moments to respond. The president-elect’s early-morning negative tweets have targeted about half a dozen companies -- including Boeing, General Motors, Toyota and air conditioner maker Carrier – and in some cases, sent stock prices plummeting. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Levick says a defensive plan would include clearly planning a social media message, identifying allies (in the case of both GM and Carrier, union leaders played significant roles as communicators defending jobs) and assembling pictures and videos that add emotive support to a response. Appealing to emotions is critical, he says. “We now exist in this post-truth and highly disruptive era and companies have to anticipate that, in fact, they are going to be dealing with a president who does not seem to be very concerned about the facts.” Levick expects to see consumer-oriented companies, such as those in technology, calculate that, at some point in the near future, it will be better to go on the offense against Trump’s White House. A few will lead and others will follow suit. “When a business-to-consumer company starts to go back at the president, starts to stand up for their position, then it’s no longer going to be smart to kowtow, to genuflect.” During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Ford Motor Co., claiming that it was planning to “fire all their employees in the United States” and move the jobs to Mexico. The company’s CEO Mark Fields responded that the allegation was incorrect and “it’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.” But, since Trump won the presidency, Ford has taken a less confrontational approach. And on Jan. 3, it announced it was shelving a $1.6-billion expansion in Mexico in favour of creating new jobs in Michigan. That same day, Trump turned his sights on General Motors, attacking its production of its compact Chevrolet Cruze. GM’s stock immediately fell by $2.   General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Boeing’s shares lost almost 1 per cent a few hours after Trump tweeted that a new 747 Air Force One for future presidents would cost more than $4 billion. Boeing responded that it was involved only in a $170-million early development phase and the Air Force clarified that $3.2 billion had been budgeted for two planes.   Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Military contractor Lockheed Martin’s shares fell more than 5 per cent after Trump said Dec. 12 that the cost of the F-35 fighter jet program is “out of control.” Related Stories Ford cancels plan to build new Mexican plant, adds U.S. jobs Toyota stock dip after Trump tweet on planned Mexico plant Lockheed falls as Trump tweets that F-35 program is costly Photos U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is a prime business risk in 2017 but companies will soon start firing back against his Twitter attacks, says Washington-based communications expert Richard Levick.

Chief among them in the national security arena is the Senate Armed Services hearing for retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be Defense secretary, set for Thursday morning. Story Continued Below The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is also scheduled to hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon for retired Marine Gen. John Kelly to be secretary of Homeland Security. The president-elect has yet to select a Veterans Affairs secretary — despite making overhauling the department a cornerstone of his presidential campaign — after several candidates backed out. WHAT TO WATCH FOR WITH MATTIS: Trump’s pick for Defense secretary may be a favorite of Senate Democrats, but that doesn’t mean they won’t take a hard run at him during his confirmation hearing. The Washington Post report Friday detailing divisions between Mattis’ and Trump’s team over Pentagon personnel will only add fuel to the Democratic desire to highlight as many differences as possible between Mattis and the president-elect. And Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) may well join in, too, with questions about the increasing tense U.S. relations with Russia. Mattis can expect to be pressed on a wide array of issues, from Trump’s comments on Russia to the fight against the Islamic State to the president-elect’s slamming defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing on Twitter. Also look for plenty of parochial questions — think nukes from Nebraska and subs from Connecticut — along with issues like military sexual assault from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Here’s what the Pro Defense team will be watching for: JEREMY HERB: Mattis has previously expressed concerns about the threat from Russia and President Vladimir Putin, but just how far will he be willing to go to distance himself from Trump’s comments on both the U.S. intelligence findings and Trump’s desire to improve relations? CONNOR O’BRIEN: Multiple Democrats in the House and Senate have already said they won’t vote for a waiver to allow Mattis, who’s only been out of uniform only three of the required seven years, to serve as Defense secretary. To what extent will civilian-military relations be a concern for the senators charged with confirming Mattis? ELLEN MITCHELL: I’ll be closely watching Mattis’ comments on the defense industry, particularly how he plans to work with companies on future contracts, and any response to Trump's criticism of the costs for the F-35 and new Air Force One. GREGORY HELLMAN: I’ll be watching Mattis’ answers on the need to articulate a new strategy to address the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, including whether he’d recommend additional ground troops to counter the Islamic State or increase support for Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime. MATTIS DISCLOSES DEFENSE INDUSTRY WORK, we have the story with Jeremy: "President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, retired Gen. James Mattis, is worth as much as $10 million, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics — a good chunk of it earned in the past three years from his work with defense giant General Dynamics and other companies. “Mattis’ financial disclosure, posted publicly on Sunday, shows he has between $3.5 million and $10 million, with much of the assets in mutual funds and bank accounts. That also includes between $600,000 and $1.25 million in stock and options in General Dynamics, where he currently serves as a member of the board of directors." Mattis agreed to divest his GD stock and recuse himself for one year on issues involving the defense contractor, according to an ethics agreement also released over the weekend. The two-page legal agreement also states that, if confirmed, Mattis will step down from the board of GD as well as from his post at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Our full story with Jeremy on the agreement is here. MATTIS URGED IRAN STRIKE OVER U.S. TROOP DEATHS IN IRAQ, report Greg Jaffe and Adam Entous of The Washington Post: "The Iranian-supplied rockets were raining down on Gen. James N. Mattis’s troops throughout the spring and summer of 2011 with greater and greater intensity...Mattis, the top American commander in the Middle East, was determined to send a clear message to Tehran to stop it. His proposal, crafted with the support of the ambassador and the senior American commander in Iraq, was to hit back inside Iran, said current and former senior U.S. officials, who took part in the debate. "One option was a dead-of-night U.S. strike against an Iranian power plant or oil refinery, said the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations...Mattis’s proposals quickly reached the White House, which had a different view of how to curb Iran’s increasingly aggressive behavior." THE HOMETOWN BEAT — MATTIS ALWAYS COMES HOME TO RICHLAND, The Seattle Times profiles Mattis' strong ties to the small town in Washington state where he grew up: "James Mattis, the retired Marine Corps general President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate for defense secretary, came of age in a cloistered community created by the federal government at the dawn of the nuclear age." "In a storied Marine career, he emerged as a keen student of history known for compassion and respect for those he commanded, impatience with bureaucracy and a relentless determination to pursue enemy forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. All the while, Mattis has returned home again and again. In recent years, he has spent most of his time at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank in California. But he still lists a modest wood-frame Richland house, built by the government for Hanford workers, as his residence. He serves on the board of a food bank, stops by the VFW, and in November reported for jury duty on a gross-misdemeanor case."

ALSO THIS WEEK — SASC HEARING ON CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS: Ahead of a confirmation hearing and a markup of a waiver for Mattis, Senate Armed Services is set to hold a hearing Tuesday on civilian control of the military to hear expert testimony from Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins School Of Advanced International Studies and Kathleen Hicks of the Center For Strategic And International Studies. TRUMP'S TEA PARTY PICK FOR OMB DIRECTOR IS ON COLLISION COURSE WITH GOP HAWKS, the story from Jeremy: "Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) has sought to slash military spending for years, teaming up with liberal Democrats Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland to force votes on amendments slicing billions off the top of the defense budget. And he’s cheered the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration that slowed the rise of federal spending. "Now that he's been tapped to lead the powerful White House Office of Management and Budget, the primary gatekeeper for the president's annual budget proposal, Mulvaney has many supporters of more military spending on edge over how exactly he will shape Trump's campaign pledge to raise the spending caps currently imposed on the military...'When anyone has ever had a conversation with him actually about the budget and spending, he comes up short,' the lawmaker said on the condition of anonymity, to candidly provide his views." PRIEBUS CLAIMS TRUMP ACCEPTS RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE ELECTION-YEAR HACKING, reports POLITICO’s Kevin Robillard: "Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump accepts that Russia played a role in hacking the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. "Trump 'is not denying that entities in Russia were behind this particular hacking campaign,' Priebus said on 'Fox News Sunday.' Trump has only indirectly acknowledged the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in the election and has consistently downplayed its significance — and the president-elect has a history of later contradicting what his surrogates tell the media." MARINES RETURNING TO AFGHANISTAN TO FIGHT THE TALIBAN THIS SPRING, via Mujib Mashal of The New York Times: "Approximately 300 United States Marines will return this spring to help fight a resurgent Taliban in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, the site of a yearslong bloody campaign, American officials in Afghanistan said on Saturday. "An American military spokesman in Kabul said the Marines would replace an Army unit stationed in Helmand, and would offer training and advice to members of the Afghan military and the national police...The Marines were last in Helmand, a hotbed of Taliban fighters and poppy cultivation, in October 2014." — U.S. RAMPS UP AIRSTRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN, writes Jessica Donati for The Wall Street Journal: "The U.S. Air Force dramatically increased the number of airstrikes it carried out in Afghanistan in 2016, data released by the military shows, a further sign of growing U.S. involvement in the war following the withdrawal of most coalition troops two years ago. "The increased engagement follows the U.S.’s decision last year to widen the military’s authority to conduct offensive operations in Afghanistan amid gains made by the Taliban, its largest insurgency, and Islamic State’s affiliate in the country." TRUCK ATTACKS KILLS FOUR ISRAELI SOLDIERS IN JERUSALEM, reports Josef Federman of The Associated Press: "A Palestinian truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of Israeli soldiers at a popular Jerusalem tourist spot Sunday, killing four people and wounding 17 others in the deadliest single attack of more than a year of Israeli-Palestinian violence. "The attack came at a time of heightened tensions in Jerusalem, where Palestinians have warned of dire consequences if incoming President Donald Trump follows through on his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to the city. The atmosphere among Israelis is also charged following last week's manslaughter conviction of an Israeli soldier who fatally shot a wounded Palestinian attacker."

This represents a CAGR of 8.1% during the period 2016-2022. North America is the major revenue-generating regional market and would continue to be the leader until 2022. While aerospace and defense projects such as Boeing and Airbus are the primary drivers for growth and development of the CFRP market, the high costs of CFRP and long production cycles is expected to restrain the market growth. The thermosetting segment accounted for more than two-thirds of the market revenue in 2015 and would continue to lead the market until 2022. This was attributed to its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, hardness, and temperature independence. The epoxy resin segment accounted for more than 60% share in world thermosetting CFRP market, in terms of both market volume and revenue, in 2015. Pultrusion & winding is the most commonly adopted manufacturing process as the process generates high production volumes in minimal time; approximately 23,565 tons CFRP was manufactured using this process in 2015. The aerospace & defense industry generates the highest revenue, which generated about US$5,576 million revenue in 2014.

Poland Acquires First Strike Capability to Pose Threat to Russia By Peter Korzun Global Research, January 09, 2017 Strategic Culture Foundation 8 January 2017 Region: Europe Theme: Militarization and WMD, US NATO War Agenda It should be noted that quite often the most interesting arms contracts escape media attention. That’s how it was in 2016. Signing a multi-billion-dollar military aid package between the United States and Israel and the subsequent White House approval for long-awaited fighter sales to the Middle East hit the radar screen. In late September, the US approved the sales of Boeing fighters worth a total of around $7 billion to Kuwait and Qatar. First mooted around two years ago, the deals had been held up by the US government due to Israeli concerns and in order to smooth the way for nuclear talks with Iran. The same month, a $38-billion Israeli arms package over the next 10 years – the largest of its kind ever – was finalized and signed. The news about those contacts was a real scoop hitting the headlines of all mainstream media outlets. In late November, the State Department approved another transaction- the acquisition of 70 AGM-158B JASSM-ER (extended range) missiles for Poland. The deal undeservedly failed to attract much attention. In fact, it matters much and changes a lot. The prospects for the acquisition of the extended range version were discussed as far back as 2014. The US obviously procrastinated due to political considerations. The decision to make the deal go through makes Poland the first state outside the United States to acquire the JASSM-ER. In 2014, Poland signed a contract to procure the JASSM AGM-158A version for its F-16C/D jets. The stealth missile is designed to destroy ground targets at distances 370+km (230 mi). As of 2014, the JASSM had also entered service in Australia and Finland. The 370 km is a great range for the purpose of self-defense. But Poland badly wanted strategic conventional first strike capability. With the JASSM-ER deal reached, its dream has come true. Using a more efficient engine and larger fuel volume in an airframe with the same external dimensions as the JASSM, the JASSM-ER has an operational range of 1000+km (620 mi) – an effective stealth weapon to knock out key stationary infrastructure sites located deep in Russia’s territory. The weapon boasts a penetrating warhead. With the AGM-158A expected to become fully operational this year, Poland has the aircraft and crews ready to receive the extended range version. The JASSM-ER has 70% hardware commonality and 95% software commonality with the original AGM-158 JASSM. Poland has made a significant contribution into NATO’s long-range conventional superiority to further complicate the prospects for further progress in the field of arms control. The first strike capability presupposes that Russia would introduce corresponding changes into its military planning. The home bases of Polish F-16 fighters carrying the JASSM-ER will inevitably become potential first strike targets in case of conflict with Russia. The study of defense contracts signed recently by the United States with other countries shows that potential threats to Russia are growing. For instance, an A/N FPS-132 Block 5 Early Warning Radar (EWR) with an operational range of 5,000 km is to be installed in Qatar. Described as ordinary arms sales, the deals are kept out of arms control discourse and public spotlight but putting together bits of information allows to compose the whole picture and identify the creeping menaces. It’s not air-to surface first strike capability only. Poland has been implementing the plans to form a 50,000 strong paramilitary territorial defense force, a planned military reserve component of the regular military, since 2015. Roughly, 20,000 guards will join the ranks of the new force in 2017. Warsaw plans to increase the size of the army by at least 50 percent in the coming years (from about 95,000 to 150,000), including the creation of three brigades for the territorial defense of the country on the eastern flank. The military is going through long-term modernization program with significant equipment acquisitions planned for 2017 through 2022 to involve new air defense systems, ballistic missiles, a new fighter trainer aircraft, combat and transport helicopters, submarines, self-propelled howitzers and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Around 1200 UAVs are to be procured, including at least 1000 with combat capabilities. According to NATO plans, Poland will host rapid response troops starting this year. Warsaw has demanded a full-scale permanent base of the alliance on its territory. A NATO Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense site to be positioned in Poland in 2018 and the AGM-158B are two destabilizing factors that undermine security in Europe and obstruct prospects for arms control. Both threats to peace come from Poland. There are reasons to believe that 2017 will be the year when tensions in the Old Continent are reduced. The Russian Foreign Ministry has just confirmed this view in a statement. The BMD and the AGM-158B are the issues to be raised if Russia and NATO launch arms control talks as some leading European nations have suggested recently. But Poland seems to be marching out of step. The JASSM-ER deal is a highly provocative step towards Russia undermining the security of Europe and positioning Poland at the frontline of the arms race.

The grocer has just announced a 15 per cent surge in December sales James Moore @JimMooreJourno Monday 9 January 2017 12:40 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Aldi lights up the grocery sector This is how a well-paid City analyst explained to me why he shopped at Aldi: “It’s simple. Why should I put money in the pockets of Tesco shareholders?” That an increasing number of people are sharing that sentiment can be seen in the 15 per cent rise in December sales the German retailer has just reported.  Read more Aldi to become the highest paying supermarket in the UK Combine a formidable reputation for value with a hard-won reputation for quality, one that stacks up very well when combined to the mainstream supermarkets (and is better than some), and you have a winning formula.  Pretty much the only reason to shun the place is snobbery. More fool those willing to put money into the pockets of Tesco shareholders for that reason. Or Sainsbury’s shareholders, for that matter. That their numbers are shrinking, however, can be seen in Aldi stocking premium ranges designed to attract people with the disposable income to trade up. Not to mention the ski clothes it features in the aisle of mad decisions, where special offers live, ranging from clothes to consumer electronics to DIY to vacuum cleaners.  Read more Aldi to become the highest paying supermarket in the UK Tesco increases market share for first time in five years Sainsbury’s better for shoppers than shareholders It is true that the 15 per cent sales rise over Christmas needs a bit of context adding to it. Aldi is one of those retailers that refuses to provide like for like sales figures. For those unaccustomed to City jargon, that means figures just from stores open at least a year. These would provide a picture of how the business is doing excluding the contribution from new store openings. Aldi is opening a lot of new stores, and will continue to do so over the next few years. These account for a significant proportion of its growth, and it's hard to tell how much the exiting estate is contributing to its numbers. Enough to keep its bosses happy, is probably the answer.  Retail types keep saying that Aldi (and its rival Lidl) will eventually slow down and find a level when compared to the other grocers, as has happened with the other markets they have entered. It doesn’t look as if that’s going to happen soon in the UK market.   Aldi’s domestic competitors are more or less learning to live with the new reality because they don't have much choice. But they’re not living well. The next couple of weeks will give an indication of how not well. With rumours of a Tesco revival doing the rounds of planet retail, and Morrison’s seeming to have turned itself around, Asda is looking very exposed (as is Sainsbury’s).  Retail analyst Nick Bubb this morning pointed out that the widely followed Grocer “33” weekly supermarket pricing survey in Saturday’s Grocer magazine saw Morrison’s win, even though the survey was done on Dec 17th, well before its latest price cuts. Its basket of £59.51 was 62p cheaper than Sainsbury and 92p cheaper than Asda.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty This, he said, meant that Asda had to dole out a chunky £6.53 voucher because it wasn’t able to live up to its guarantee of being 10 per cent cheaper than its rival.  PS Amazon's just getting started.  Ouch.

The 437th Maintenance Group, Operations Group and the Aerial Port Squadron supported the evaluation conducted at Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina. The idea for the new synthetic equipment was approved in September 2015, with plans to complete early this year. US Air Force Research Laboratory aviation project manager captain Randall Hodkin said: “This idea was submitted by Boeing and gained a lot of interest. “We awarded them the contract, they worked the initial design and presented it to us for assessment. "After our recommendations, they created three design variations and the best solution was chosen for demonstration at Joint Base Charleston.” The tie downs and winch cables are expected to reduce weight by nearly 1,000lb on each aircraft, increasing aircraft fuel efficiency. "The installation of the new synthetic equipment could save the air force nearly $4m annually and provide additional safety." Tie downs are ropes, cords, straps or chains that secure items during airlift operations and winch cables help adjust the tension on tie downs, securing the load, the USAF said in a statement. The installation of the new synthetic equipment could save the air force nearly $4m annually and provide additional safety. The synthetic tie downs will eventually be used for all cargo aircraft. However, the winch cable will remain specific to the C-17, the statement said.

News Business Business News Taxpayers make further losses on Lloyds Bank shares as Government cuts stake below 6% The public is no longer the largest shareholder in the lender but questions over value for money remain Ben Chapman Monday 9 January 2017 09:30 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The Government said it hoped to offload its remaining shares in Lloyds within a year Getty The taxpayer is no longer the largest shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group after the Government reduced its stake to less than 6 per cent. But the public has lost more money as the shares languish below the price Gordon Brown’s government paid for them in 2009. UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which manages the government’s stake in Lloyds, cut its holding in the lender from 6.93 per cent to 5.95 per cent after selling around 700 million shares. UKFI has not stated the exact price achieved for the stake, but Lloyds has been trading below 65p for most of the last month – less than the 73.6p taxpayers paid to bail out the stricken lender during the financial crisis. UKFI said more than £18bn had been returned to Government coffers since the lender’s £20.3bn bailout. Read more Lloyds share sale cuts Government stake to under 8% However, that figure also does not take into account the interest paid on the billions in debt the Government used to buy its stake or fees paid to investment bankers to manage the sale, the National Audit Office has noted. In October the Government controversially ditched plans for a share sale to the public, opting instead to offer the stake to institutional investors. It said it hoped to offload its remaining shares in Lloyds within a year. Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio said: “Today’s announcement that the UK Government is no longer our largest shareholder is a key milestone in the journey of Lloyds Banking Group back to full private ownership, returning taxpayers’ money at a profit.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty “It also reflects the hard work undertaken by everyone at Lloyds over the last five years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.” The Government still retains a 73 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been hit by ongoing scandals, keeping its share price low and making an imminent disposal unlikely. In October, leaked internal documents supported allegations that the bank had systematically squeezed its small business owner customers in order to extract profits from them when they were at risk of insolvency. RBS also faces up to $12bn in fines from US regulators over allegations of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.

Collier Research Corporation has announced they have become a member of NASA’s Advanced Composites Consortium (ACC). Collier, the only software company in the ACC, is among the newest members joining the original group formed in 2015—NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC), FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, The Boeing Company, General Electric Company (GE), Lockheed Martin Corporation, United Technologies Corporation, and the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) – ACC Integrator. Also new to the ACC are Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, Orbital ATK, the University of South Carolina McNAIR Center for Aerospace Innovation and Research, and the Wichita State University National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR). The ACC aims to bring better composite material analysis, design, and manufacturing into practice to help maintain American leadership in aviation manufacturing. The consortium was formed by NASA in support of the Advanced Composites Project, which is part of the Advanced Air Vehicles Program in the agency’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. The project’s goal is to reduce product development and certification timelines by 30 percent for composite aircraft. The push to take weight out of structures designed for flight is leading to a greater use of composites in the aerospace industry. As these advanced materials are more complex to certify than metals, the use of automated,  integrated analysis and design-performance optimization is critical—from the earliest stages of development all the way through manufacturing—to ensure that composites are used most effectively and certified for flight most efficiently. Craig Collier, President of Collier Research. Craig Collier has been appointed cooperative research team (CRT) leader of two ACC initiatives: rapid tools and design for manufacturing. “Rapid tools are important because the bulk of aircraft design development and structural certification analysis revolves around them,” says Collier. “The design maturation process spans several years. Shortening this long portion of the schedule will have a huge impact on the aircraft production timeline. Design for manufacturing includes technologies such as robotic automated fiber placement (AFP) and curing processes during the analysis and optimization design phases. Merging these technologies early and iteratively will help engineers improve quality and consistency in laminate fabrication, resulting in fewer defects and streamlined certification. Collier. Collier Research’s HyperSizer was the first software to be commercialized out of NASA. It has been used on many projects for the U.S. Space Program (such as the Orion Crew Module) and by many aircraft manufacturers—including Spirit AeroSystems, which designed a fuselage for the Bell V-280 Valor defense helicopter prototype for the Department of Defense’s Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR TD) program.

Chief Executive Officer Duong Tri Thanh said Viet Nam Airlines began preparing to provide direct flights to the U.S. 10 years ago. The carrier has focused on enhancing the long-haul flying experience for passengers by expanding its fleet with larger airplanes, including Airbus 350 – 900s and Boeing B787 Dreamliners, Thanh added. FAA plans to come to Viet Nam to give assessment about the system and may grant CAT1 in accordance with IASA standards (international aviation safety assessment) to CAAV. Once getting approval from FAA, the U.S. Department of Transportation will consider granting freedom to Viet Nam’s airlines to open direct air routes to the U.S. A CAAV report shows that the aviation market in 2016 witnessed strong growth in passenger and cargo air transport output and flight regulations.  The watchdog agency said the work of ensuring aviation safety was implemented well in a year of increased growth rate in aviation. This was the 19th consecutive year Viet Nam has ensured safety for flights with no serious accidents.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque.    5411468 Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said in a recent interview that if President-elect Donald Trump tries to drop the F-35 in favor of the F-18, the service will oppose that move. In December, Trump caused a scene when he suggested that Boeing price out a version of the F-18 to substitute for the F-35, the most expensive weapons program in history. James is now pushing back against the idea that the F-18 could possibly compare to the F-35, Defense News reports. For James, the F-35 is a much more advanced weapons system. “The Air Force does not view the F/A-18 and the F-35 to be substitutable at all,” James said in an interview with Defense News Jan. 5. “They fulfill different requirements. They’re both fine aircraft, don’t get me wrong. But it’s fourth generation, and F-35 is fifth generation.” “The leaders of the Air Force will have the opportunity when the time comes to advise the president-elect on this,” James said. “But based on everything I know, the two are not interchangeable and the Air Force has not expressed interest in the F/A-18s.” James said it’s unclear what exactly Trump intends to do with the F-35, but from what she can tell, he seems to be trying to drive down the cost. Trump’s view on the F-35 may represent another clash between himself and his pick for secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, who has affirmed to Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal that he has a “clear commitment” to the F-35 program. Trump first tweeted out Dec. 12 that “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” hinting that he would try and reduce the cost of the weapons program once he officially takes over the presidency. He followed up that tweet Dec. 22 with a request that Boeing “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump does have the authority to cancel a weapons program, but it seems as though the Air Force will advise against that move.

US President Barack Obama has advised his successor Donald Trump to avoid running the White House like his business empire. Key points: Barack Obama says Donald Trump must understand the difference between campaigning and governing Mr Obama says Mr Trump "has not spent a lot of time sweating the details" Mr Trump will be inaugurated on January 20 The outgoing President said he has been in regular communication with Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated in less than two weeks. Mr Obama said the President-elect must understand the difference between campaigning and leading a country. "What he has to appreciate is as soon as you walk into this office after you've been sworn-in, you're now in charge of the largest organisation on Earth," Mr Obama said. "You can't manage it the way you would manage a family business." Mr Obama added he and Mr Trump are "sort of opposites in some ways". Trump has not 'spent a lot of time sweating the details' The comments were made in an interview with ABC America's This Week program, where Mr Obama singled out their contrasting approaches to policy matters. Mr Obama said he was on the "policy wonk" end of the spectrum, in contrast to Mr Trump. "I think that he has not spent a lot of time sweating the details," Mr Obama said. External Link: @ThisWeekABC: "@POTUS says he's told Donald Trump you can't run the Oval Office 'the way you would manage a family business'. The President warned that quirk could give Mr Trump fresh perspective once he takes office, but it also could blindside him. "There are world capitals and financial markets and people all around the world who take really seriously what he [Mr Trump] says," Mr Obama added. In early December Mr Trump took to social media to complain about the costs of a new Boeing 747 Air Force One aircraft. The same day as the tweet Lockheed Martin and Boeing Stocks fell — albeit briefly. Stocks in Toyota also dropped after the President-elect tweeted about the car manufacturers factory in Mexico. Mr Trump's use of his Twitter account to communicate has raised concern among several politicians — notably outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden. The Russians 'meddled' in election: Obama Video: 'Vladimir Putin is not on our team', Barack Obama tells media, Republicans (ABC News) In the same interview, Mr Obama also talked about the US intelligence agency's report into alleged cyber hacking by Russia in an attempt to influence the presidential election. The hacking case against Putin US intelligence agencies have released an unclassified version of their report concluding Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence America's presidential election in favour of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Mr Obama warned Mr Trump underestimated the impact that cyber hacking and misinformation could have on democracies and called on Americans to unite against Russian attacks. "The Russians intended to meddle, and they meddled," Mr Obama said. "One of the things that I'm concerned about is the degree to which, there are Republicans who seem to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans, because those fellow Americans are Democrats — that cannot be." Mr Trump has repeatedly taken to Twitter to reject the allegations of Russian involvement in hacking ahead on November's election. However, the incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, has since said that Mr Trump accepted the intelligence findings and may take action. Mr Trump will be inaugurated on January 20.

Now there’s an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or “triggers,” users about changes in market indicators, Business Insider reported. Since the launch of the feature Wednesday, it’s become the most popular trigger on the app, according to the company. After Trump tweeted about the cost for Boeing to build Air Force One, the company’s stock took a downturn, and a similar stock slump happened for Lockheed Martin after he tweeted about the company’s F-35 jet program, MarketWatch reported. Some company leaders are saying that their PR employees are up around 3 a.m. in case Trump sends out an early-morning tweet that could devastate the company’s stock, CNN wrote in a dispatch from this year’s CES tech trade show. [HANDOUT] Trigger Finance launched last year as a simple tool to help investors monitor the real-world events that affect their stock portfolio. Mayer said that they have long been interested in developing triggers for more non-traditional market indicators, such as announcements from important figures like Janet L. Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, or billionaire investor Warren Buffett. A Trump trigger is their first foray into this realm, although they’ve been hearing demand from customers for similar triggers for others, such as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. “Tweets really do matter,” Mayer said.

Close share panel Image copyright Boom Image caption The XB-1 supersonic prototype has been nicknamed "Baby Boom" It has been a tough few years for the aviation industry and 2016 proved no different. Carriers had to navigate the collapse in oil prices and multiple plane tragedies including EgyptAir in May and the Chapecoense crash in Colombia, as well as fire-prone Samsung phones. However, it is worth noting that last year was actually one of the safest in modern aviation history. So what does 2017 hold in store? Here are some trends to watch out for. Supersonic passenger planes Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson reportedly tried to buy the Concorde fleet but was rebuffed Remember Concorde? It's been more than a decade since the plane was retired from service. But British billionaire Sir Richard Branson is looking to usher in the age of the supersonic flight once again; and make it affordable to the masses. His company Virgin Galactic is working with US start-up Boom to develop the XB-1, which is being plugged as the world's fastest civil aircraft ever made. Image copyright Boom Image caption Boom is developing Concorde's successor but you'll have to wait until at least 2023 for a flight Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also developing supersonic passenger jets, but Sir Richard is hoping to beat them to the punch. The prototype, nicknamed "Baby Boom", will see its first test flight take place later this year though the first commercial flight of its scaled-up successor is not expected until 2023. It has a cruising speed 10% faster than the Concorde (which flew at more than twice the speed of sound) and is nearly three times the speed of a regular plane. Boom's airliner is designed to carry 40 passengers at a time and fly between London and New York in just three hours and 15 minutes. The price for a flight? A mere £2,500 each way. Continuing profits Oil prices are creeping back upward but airlines are set to remain profitable in 2017. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts the global airline industry will make $29.8bn (£24bn) in 2017, its third straight year of profit. Last year the sector logged a record $35.6bn. "These three years are the best performance in the industry's history, irrespective of the many uncertainties we face," says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. "After many years of hard work in restructuring and re-engineering the business the industry is also more resilient". But the profits won't be evenly spread; the strongest performance is expected to be come from North America, which has seen a wave of airline consolidation in recent years. Ultra long air routes Forget about comparing plane sizes, this year will be focused on route lengths and who can claim the title of world's longest flight operator. Emirates currently holds the crown with the 14,200km (8,820 miles) journey between Dubai and Auckland. That flight takes 16 hours and 5 minutes eastbound and 17h 25m westbound. Its rival Qatar Airways will overtake that in February, when it also launches a non-stop flight from Doha to New Zealand's largest city, covering 14,542km, with a flight time of between 17 and a half hours and 18 and a half hours. In terms of kilometres, the longest route is Air India's Delhi to San Francisco (15,300km) - which now flies over the Pacific Ocean instead of the Atlantic - but because of favourable tailwinds takes only 14 and a half hours. No-frills thrills Image copyright Getty Images Image caption From cars to trains to planes: Asia is the world's fastest-growing travel market Air France plans to launch a new budget carrier in late 2017 serving cities in Asia, followed by routes to the US. The Air-France KLM group already operates the Hop and Transavia budget brands in Europe. Within Europe, Ryanair and Easyjet dominate much of the market, leading many companies to look at the transatlantic route for more profits. Iceland's Wow Air will also be expanding its budget routes to the United States in June 2017. It plans to add four weekly flights via Reykjavik. More space... but at a cost Image copyright Delta Airlines Image caption Delta's new A350s will feature 32 business suites, 48 premium economy seats (pictured) and 226 main cabin economy seats There used to be first class, business class and economy, but for those of us constantly relegated to cattle class there is now an extra twist - premium economy. You're still towards the back of the plane, but you get extra legroom, service and amenities. Later this year, for example, on long-haul international flights on its new Airbus A350s, Delta Air Lines launches what it calls its "Delta Premium Select" option. You get "up to 38in of pitch, up to 19in of width and up to 7in of recline", a branded blanket with pillow and an amenity kit, it promises. The catch? The more expensive tickets are around three times the price of the standard economy fare. Cabin crew chic Image copyright Hawaiian Airlines Image caption Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' uniforms for the first time since 2008 In the post-war air travel boom, the centre aisle was marketed as a runway for glamorous stewardesses. Some carriers are now looking to recapture some of that chic with newly-revamped wardrobes. Hawaiian Airlines is changing its employees' outfits for the first time since 2008, while Delta has worked with New York designer Zac Posen to update its uniforms. Delta says its 60,000 employees will now be draped in a "wholly re-imagined" mix of colours dubbed "Passport Plum, Cruising Cardinal and Groundspeed Graphite". Which sounds more glamorous than just calling them purple, red or grey.

LIEB, Associated Press Updated: Jan 9, 2017 - 3:39 PM Twtter JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) - Former Navy SEAL officer Eric Greitens was sworn into office Monday as Missouri governor, pledging to bring an outsider's perspective to a state that for the first time will be overseen by a GOP governor paired with supermajorities of Republicans in the Legislature. He quickly took his first action, issuing an order that bans executive branch employees from accepting lobbyist gifts and prohibits governor's office personnel from lobbying his office if they later leave their jobs. Greitens took the oath of office around noon in front of the Capitol building and a crowd of more than 6,000 people on a chilly, overcast day. The state's first Jewish governor placed a hand on a Bible once owned by a World War I veteran and smiled as he recited an oath to become Missouri's 56th governor. His wife, Sheena, held the Bible as their two young sons were held by grandparents. "The people have spoken, and a new direction has been decided," Greitens said to applause in his inaugural remarks. "For decades, Missourians have talked about change. Now it's time to fight for that change." Greitens replaces term-limited Democrat Gov. Jay Nixon, who served eight years as governor during a 30-year political career that also included time as attorney general and a state senator. Four other newly elected Republican statewide officials - Lt. Gov. Mike Parson, Treasurer Eric Schmitt, Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft and Attorney General Josh Hawley - also took the oath of office. Huge U.S. and Missouri flags were draped in front of the Capitol columns and a production company erected a stage with large television screens on either side for those whose may otherwise not have a good view of the ceremony. A B2 bomber flew overhead as Greitens spoke his oath, which was immediately followed by a 19-gun artillery salute. Security at the Capitol was near its tightest ever, a new emphasis from Greitens, who has brought metal detectors back to the building for the first time since 2003. Greitens didn't outline specific policy proposals in his remarks, choosing to save those for a later day. But he pledged action to clean up a Capitol atmosphere that he had repeatedly derided while campaigning. "This is the people's house. And to those who would trouble this house for their own selfish and sinful gain, here me now: I answer to the people, and I come as an outsider to do the people's work," Greitens said. "And I know that the people do not expect miracles, but they do expect results - and we will deliver." While issuing his executive order, Greitens told reporters that it "sets a powerful example" of how he will "clean up the culture of corruption in Jefferson City." The Republican-led Legislature also is acting quickly on ethics issues. A House committee held a rare early morning meeting Monday to endorse a bill that would expand Greitens' executive order by banning lawmakers from accepting most lobbyist gifts besides flowers and honorary plaques. Lawmakers also are expected to team with Greitens to enact a variety of GOP priorities that had been vetoed by Nixon, including a right-to-work bill barring mandatory union fees. A few people held signs near the back of the crowd at Greitens' inauguration, protesting against right-to-work. Greitens also is expected to support efforts to cut down on government regulations, limit liability lawsuits in order to help businesses, enact stricter penalties for people who assault police and expand options for K-12 students' education. Greitens began the day by attending an interfaith prayer service at St. Peter Catholic Church near the Capitol, where he hugged Nixon and his wife, Georganne. In a break with tradition, Greitens skipped a parade to instead host a pre-inaugural ceremony honoring about 150 "heroes" from all walks of life, including law enforcement officers, teachers, farmers and veterans. Each one received a special coin and had the opportunity to pose for a picture with the new governor. Greitens said the event was intended to take the focus off "celebrities" and place it on "the best representatives of the Missouri people." The inaugural celebrations are to end with an evening ball inside the Capitol, where the governor and first lady are to dance to the "Missouri Waltz." The event also is to feature country music singer Sara Evans. Greitens has not revealed how much the privately-funded inaugural festivities cost, but released a list 87 "benefactors" that include businesses such as Anheuser-Busch, Boeing and Wal-Mart. Greitens, 42, grew up in the St. Louis area and joined the Navy after earning a doctoral degree in politics from Oxford University in England. He was wounded in a suicide truck bombing on his barracks while deployed in Iraq. He later founded The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps veterans transition to the private-sector through volunteer work, and became a professional public speaker and author. Greitens is hardly the first governor to start a term promising change. Such claims actually are practically a given. The theme of Nixon's first inauguration in 2008 was "A New Day for Missouri." Four years before that, former Republican Gov. Matt Blunt promised "to lead Missouri in a new direction," and four years earlier Democratic Gov. Bob Holden proclaimed "the beginning of a new vision: one bright future, one Missouri." Greitens defeated Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster in the November election as part of a Republican sweep in which Missouri voters also picked President-elect Donald Trump and re-elected U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. The only remaining statewide Democratic officeholder is Auditor Nicole Galloway, who was not on the 2016 ballot and had been appointed to the post in 2014 following the death of Republican Auditor Tom Schweich. ___ Associated Press writer Katie Kull contributed to this report.

By Julie Dugdale Published Monday at 2:38 p.m. The Ricketts Family Photo: Scott Strazzante/Chicago Tribune They poured millions into keeping him out. They suffered the Twitter wrath. They poured millions into getting him in. And suddenly Todd Ricketts found himself with a cabinet nod. Go, Cubs, go.   Marshall Pierce & Company Photo: Courtesy of Marshall Pierce & Company Remember the uproar after Ivanka’s $10,800 bracelet appeared on 60 Minutes? Jerry Bern, owner of the only independent shop in Chicago that sells Ivanka’s jewelry line, got a request for the piece right after the show aired. He’s also seen an uptick in interest in the line since the Trump campaign started.   Trump International Hotel & Tower Photo: Meg Theno/Chicago Tribune Condo sales have been slow at Trump Tower in recent months, says real estate broker Chezi Rafaeli—but that’s typical in both winter and for an election year. About 8 percent of units are for sale—double the percentage in comparable buildings. Yet recently, he says, he’s received calls from interested buyers in Russia and China (hmm).   Boeing Photo: Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune Look, nobody’s “canceling the order” to upgrade Air Force One. What’s more concerning for the Chicago-based manufacturing behemoth is that Trump continues to poke the bear with China, where a quarter of Boeing’s 737 jets were shipped in 2015.   Chicago Police Department Photo: Courtesy of CPD Trump says a stop-and-frisk policy will curb Chicago’s gun violence. Because racial profiling worked so well in New York City (not). Just what the already embattled CPD needs to build trust with residents.   Bruce Rauner Photo: Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune The governor’s head-in-the-sand strategy during the campaign might’ve earned him a short-term win: He can now cherry-pick where to align himself (see Betsy DeVos and her school choice crusade). But that might not be enough to funnel in the federal dollars Illinois needs. Because revenge. Bye, second term.   Rahm Emanuel Photo: John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune Without the help of the Clinton Express, the mayor’s only viable way forward—locally or nationally—is to pull Chicago and its morale out of disgruntled, gun-riddled quicksand. His closed-door meeting with Trump in December didn’t seem to make a dent in the Donald’s promised immigration policies. This article appears in the February 2017 issue of Chicago magazine.

Samsung, Canon, Qualcomm and Alphabet rounded out the global top five. IBM chair, president and CEO Ginni Rommety prepares to deliver a keynote address at CES in Las Vegas. Ethan Miller, Getty Imaegs Advertisement IBM received a record-breaking number of U.S. patents in 2016, topping the list for the 24th consecutive year, showing the efforts the company is making to expand its business into products that process and analyze vast amounts of health-care data. International Business Machines Corp. was awarded 8,088 patents in 2016, it said Monday. The top five winners remained the same as the previous year, with Samsung Electronics Co., Canon Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google nabbing those spots, according to data compiled by IFI Claims Patent Services, a unit of Fairview Research LLC. IBM has been working to turn around its business by putting more resources into cognitive computing, which adds a layer of data analytics and machine learning to software and information in order to pull out computer-generated insights and automate processes. CEO Ginni Rometty has been targeting the health-care industry specifically, which she often refers to as the company’s “moonshot.” “What drives the company’s focus on it is the underlying fact that health care is an instance of people drowning in data,” Chief Innovation Officer Bernie Meyerson said, adding that emerging technologies such as cheaper genomic sequencing are going to create even more health care-related information. “If you don’t have a system that can deal with that data in volume, then the physician has no chance.” Popular Now Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 Millennial Retention Needs More Attention Steps Industry Can Take to Reduce Energy Consumption Some of IBM’s patents last year involve using cardiac images to characterize the shape and motion of the heart and help detect cardiac disease, a drone that would be able to measure contamination in places like hospitals and on manufacturing floors and a method to plan routes based on a traveler’s mood. More than 2,700 of the 2016 patents involved cognitive computing or cloud technology, the company said in a statement. While about 100 patents directly involved health care, many of the more cognitive computing ones could also be applied to the industry, Meyerson said. IBM consistently spends about 6% of its annual revenue on research and development. Among the top 50 recipients of patents, U.S. companies got 41% of the total, according to IFI. Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. Boeing Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. were among the big gainers. In contrast, Japanese tech companies saw decreases in the patent awards from a year ago. “The Japanese companies are always very strong,” said Larry Cady, a senior analyst with IFI. “They remain the No. 2 country, but the total number of grants went down across the board.” Love tech?

Monday, January 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Sabah  Xiamen Airlines makes inaugural flight to KK January 10, 2017, Tuesday Shalina R. KOTA KINABALU: Xiamen Airlines’ inaugural direct flight from Fuzhou to Kota Kinabalu yesterday marked this city as its official gateway city into East Malaysia. Xiamen Airlines Kuala Lumpur Office general manager Guo Yuan said the three times weekly non-stop three-and-a-half-hour flight between the cities will not only create a convenient channel for Chinese nationals to enjoy a short holiday escape in a popular tourist destination, but also connect East Malaysia to its newest Amsterdam and New York airline destinations. “So far, most of the booking is 80% from Fuzhou on this route. More and more Chinese nationals are interested to visit Sabah,” said Guo at the inaugural flight ceremony at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) here yesterday. “Through this route, they can transit at Fuzhou on their way to our new destinations New York in America and Amsterdam in Europe as well as other international places,” he added. The Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft landed at KKIA around 5.45pm with an almost full load of 155 passengers, whilst the returning flight, scheduled to depart to Fuzhou at 6.35pm had a 60% load factor. “Southeast Asia is Xiamen Airlines’ all time strategic market. It is our great honor to have this opportunity to contribute to the economic development, cultural exchange as well as the mutual cooperation as an airline company. The new route is expected to continue the growing passenger visits from China to Malaysia,” said Guo. Xiamen is a member of Skyteam Alliance with a fleet of more than 165 Boeing Aircraft, and China’s only airline with an all-Boeing fleet. The airline, based in the city of Xiamen of Fujian Province, China, operates other non-stop flights between Fujian and Kuala Lumpur. What do you think of this story?

Continue Reading Below The Dow Jones Industrial Average, or simply the Dow, rose to as much as 19,999.63 on Friday or just shy of the widely anticipated 20,000 landmark as a strong jobs report helped further fuel the post-election rally. The equities rally has been bolstered by hopes of business-friendly policies under a new Donald Trump administration after the President-elect promised to enact $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, corporate tax cuts and potentially repeal regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, many anticipate earnings to return to growth after five consecutive quarters of declines, especially with energy stocks rebounding on rising crude oil prices and the strengthening economic outlook. With the renewed focus on the Dow, ETF investors have also jumped on the momentum with Dow-related ETFs, such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEArca:DIA), which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Guggenheim Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF (NYSEArca:DJD), which weighs the 30 Dow stocks by yield. More From FOXBusiness.com... Bank ETFs Look to Keep Their Momentum Currency-Hedged U.K. ETFs Are Making a Record Run China ETFs can Deliver in 2017 Potential investors, though, should be aware that the Dow isn't like your normal market capitalization-weighted index, such as the S&P 500. The major difference between the two indices is found in their indexing methodology. The Dow focuses on a price-weighted average of 30 stocks while the S&P 500 is a market capitalization-weighted index of 500 large companies. The Dow is composed of the 30 largest companies in the U.S. across a number of sectors. Holdings are selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal. Since the index follows price-weighted methodology, components with higher prices will have a larger impact on the daily movements in the Dow, which has drawn some criticism over its somewhat arbitrary weighting method. Daily changes in the Dow are calculated by adding prices of the 30 Dow stocks and then divided by the “Dow Divisor.” Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Currently, DIA's top holdings include Goldman Sachs Group (GS) 8.3%, 3M Co. (MMM) 6.1%, International Business Machines (IBM) 5.8%, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) 5.6% and Boeing Company (BA) 5.5%. Sector weights include industrials 19.7%, financials 17.9%, information technology 17.0%, consumer discretionary 14.3%, health care 12.8%, Energy 7.1%, consumer staples 6.7%, materials 2.5% and telecom services 1.9%. In contrast, the S&P 500 is more diversified, with its largest holding Apple (Nasdaq:AAPL) account for a little over 3%. Additionally, The S&P 500 overweights information technology, with more evenly spread out weights in its other sector positions. Meanwhile, the newer DJD weights positions on dividends, with top holdings including Chevron (CVX) 5.7%, Verizon Communications (VZ) 5.3%, Caterpillar (CAT), 5.0% Boeing (BA) 4.8% and International Business Machines (IBM) 4.4%. Sector allocations include industrials 18.9%, information technology 18.4%, healthcare 13.4%, consumer staples 11.4%, financials 11.0%, energy 9.5%, consumer discretionary 9.5%, telecom services 5.3% and materials 2.6%. Due to its weighting methodology, DJD comes with a slightly higher 2.47% 12-month yield, compared to DIA's 2.26% 12-month yield. However, DIA shows a cheaper 0.17% expense ratio, compared to DJD's 0.30% expense ratio, which diminishes the positive effect from the dividend-focused ETF's higher yield.

The launch, originally scheduled to take place on Jan. 8, had been pushed back to Jan. 9, and on Sunday, it was rescheduled to Jan. 14 due to a forecast of heavy winds and rains at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The rocket will carry 10 satellites to low-Earth orbit for the communications company Iridium. The launch will end a four-and-a-half month gap in SpaceX’s satellite launch operations. The company had put its launches on hold on Sept. 1, when an explosion destroyed one of its Falcon 9 rockets and a $200 million AMOS-6 communications satellite it was carrying. Last week, after an in-depth Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-monitored investigation, SpaceX announced it had pinpointed the cause of the mishap. Its investigation revealed “buckles” in the inner liner of one of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), which are used to store liquid helium. Related Stories SpaceX, Boeing Win NASA Contracts For Crewed ISS Missions SpaceX Releases Teaser For 'World's Most Powerful Rocket' “Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled liquid oxygen can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail,” SpaceX explained in an anomaly update. “In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.” In order to prevent such catastrophic COPV failure, the company plans to — in the short-term — change the way it loads helium, and, in the long term, implement design changes to the COPV to stop it from buckling. “The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes,” SpaceX said. The conclusions of the investigation were approved by the FAA on Friday, which authorized SpaceX to carry out seven launches of its Falcon 9 version 1.2 rockets.

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara) Sydney - Japanese shares hit a six-month top on Tuesday as the dollar advanced on the yen, while risk sentiment got a lift after factory surveys in the United States and Europe boasted the best readings of the year so far. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 percent to its highest since late April as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.3 percent. Markets elsewhere were more mixed, leaving MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan flat. South Korea's main index slipped 0.6 percent after data showed Samsung Electronic's decision to scrap its Galaxy Note 7 dragged on the entire economy in the third quarter, though growth still pipped forecasts. Wall Street had taken encouragement from upbeat corporate results and the Dow ended Monday up 0.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.91 percent. Over one third of US companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added an extra fizz in the wake of AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Aiding risk sentiment was the Markit survey of US manufacturing which climbed to a one-year top of 53.2. Business activity in the euro zone also expanded at the fastest pace this year so far in October and firms raised prices at the sharpest rate in more than five years. The better news led investors to nudge up the probability of a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve to around 74 percent and pressured Treasury prices. It also lifted the US dollar to a nine-month high against a basket of major currencies at 98.846. The dollar firmed on the yen to 104.43, threatening the month's peak at 104.62, while the euro struggled at $1.0870. One mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the US dollar down to C$1.3345 from a peak at C$1.3398. In commodities, oil prices dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 6 cents at $51.40 a barrel, while US crude also lost 6 cents to $50.46.

 This app will send you alerts when Donald Trump tweets about stocks you own Nathan McAlone Jan. 4, 2017, 6:30 PM 12,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump. Carlo Allegri/Reuters When President-elect Donald Trump tweets about a public company, the market listens.  And if you hold the stock of one of the companies that has come into Trump's crosshairs, finance app Trigger thinks you'll want to know about it. The free iPhone app works by letting you set up financial "triggers," which you can then use to guide your investment decisions. For example, you can set a reminder to sell a stock when its price reaches a certain level, moves a specific percentage, hits a one-year low or high, and so on. When the condition occurs, Trigger sends you a notification, and you can decide whether to act on it. Now the company has rolled out a special "Trump trigger." The trigger "gives you the ability to trade stocks based off of Trump’s tweets about public companies," the startup wrote. Basically, the trigger works by notifying you if Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock that you own, in real time. Trump has tweeted about companies from Apple to Amazon to AT&T — and that's just the A's. In some cases, such as when Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of a new Air Force One jet, the aerospace company's stock immediately fell nearly 2%. Should this pattern continue during Trump's presidency, it's not difficult to see why investors might want to be quickly alerted to tweets about their holdings.  Trigger Trigger characterized the Trump trigger as the first step toward the startup using "not just price based data but relevant world events to condense into simple IF this, THEN that rules." Expect a bunch of varied types of financial signals in the future. If the idea of setting up these types of notifications for your investments intrigues you, check out Trigger's website, or its iPhone app. Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

Done Editing Tags 85 Comments Share this article 69 69 69 The proposed Ares vehicles, primary workhorse of the Space Launch System (SLS) compared in gross dimensions to predecessors like the space shuttle and Saturn V. The eastern shore of central Florida is strangely quiet these days. In years past, mighty rockets split the sky on long pillars of flame, startling flocks of water birds and lulling huge gators out of the nearby marshes to rumble along in the infrasonic. First, it was the Saturn V, a giant among its kind, thundering almost cautiously into orbit and beyond, its tiny Apollo payload perched on top, bound for the moon. Then it was followed by the STS, better known as the Space Shuttle, a sleek winged sci-fi looking space plane piggy-backed on two solid state boosters, rising so often over the Atlantic it got to be routine.  It was never routine for those of us who lived here. Even the widest-screen TV cannot capture the splendor and scope of a shuttle launch. Especially at night, when the SRB’s first lit up, turning the entire eastern horizon pink and orange, as if the world were ending, as if sun had gone nova and risen in fiery protest one last time. As the stack rose it would cast tremendous, flickering shadows of anti-orange on the ground, and it would throw colored, moving shadows into any lingering clouds above. You could watch it with the naked eye right into low Earth orbit until it finally winked out, curving over the far edge of the planet. It was a glorious and powerful sight. NASA was great in those days. But those days are gone, and the political climate has reversed itself. This sudden change in both leadership style and political party could not have come at a worse time for NASA. We’ll review the primary conflict over the future of NASA in broad strokes below. NASA remains popular thanks to beautiful images from the Hubble Space Telescope, and of course thanks to the shuttle and those successful Apollo project beginning more than 50 years ago. A replacement to Hubble already in late-stage testing could extend that legacy. Unmanned successes like Mars Curiosity and New Horizons certainly don’t hurt the agency’s reputation with the public. But NASA has always been vulnerable to political winds. Regime changes can be devastating to programs that take a decade or more to launch, and more years to deliver results to a taxpaying public that suffers from an ever-decreasing attention span in the age of 140-character policy making, or 15 minutes of Facebook fame. NASA was already at a crossroads. There is of course the alarming and well reported Trumpian animosity toward funding for NASA Earth science: Walker (inaccurately) said that "half" the world's climate scientists doubt that humans are warming the planet. Walker wants to shift new climate research from NASA to other government agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  … "We're not going to stand for that," said astrobiologist David Grinspoon in a recent interview with Indre Viskontas on our Inquiring Minds podcast. "We're going to keep doing Earth science and make the case for it. We'll get scientists to march on Washington if we have to. There's going to be a lot of resistance.” But the biggest battle will be over the Space Launch System, or SLS. It’s affectionately called the Senate Launch System by opponents—but the SLS is no joke. A lot of dollars and careers hang in the balance, and its destination isn’t the ISS or even the moon. The SLS is an integrated system that can take the first humans to Mars and beyond featuring a sweet, huge new booster similar to the legendary Saturn V. But it’s facing off against the upstarts, companies like SpaceX and Blue Origins, created by billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, collectively referred to under the umbrella term NewSpace. The question then becomes: what’s the best bang for the space-buck, and how might those decisions impact NASA, the aerospace industry, and the taxpaying general public? This is all coming to a head at a chaotic time. A new, wholly unpredictable, and at times volatile administration is about to seize the White House. Donald Trump makes George W. Bush look like a Nobel Laureate when it comes to science in general. But most Americans in his age cohort have fond memories of NASA. They don’t want to be the people found guilty of murdering it. That might work in favor of space science, in this one isolated instance. The looming bare-knuckle brawl will be fought in the corporate arena, between traditional aerospace contractors like Lockheed and Boeing who would garner considerable Ares business, and alternatives like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy series. That struggle plays out in unexpected ways. Conservatives with NASA facilities in their regions, like Huntsville and Houston, end up staunchly supporting Big Government Science programs, whereas progressive politicians in other places that would benefit from NewSpace find themselves arguing for lean and mean private contractors. Traditional aerospace contractors have well-established lobbies hard at work on the House and Senate. The same companies that might build parts of the SLS should it get the green light have been delivering fighters and military satellites and rocket boosters for MIRVS for decades. They know how to politic and they know how to bottle up critical ledge in committee and keep it off the floor for a vote, if that ledge threatens their business. You can see a great example of that here from just a couple of years ago. How will all this play out? Will NASA continue to research and execute manned missions? If only we could tie this article up with a neat conclusion. But like many questions before the new administration, there’s no sign either way. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens—probably by watching Twitter.  85 Comments Share this article 69 69 69 85 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

"We're at the final lap within these two weeks," the minister, Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. "We hope we can find the plane." Liow did not specify a date but said that a tripartite meeting will be held after a final report is released when the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) search ends. Authorities had previously said the search will end early this year. The last search vessel embarked on its final sweep across the southern Indian Ocean last month. The Malaysian Airlines jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. It is believed that the Malaysian Airlines plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, but an extensive deep-sea hunt off Australia's west coast has failed to find a single piece of debris. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has been leading the search mission, said in a report last month that the Boeing jet is almost certainly not in the current search zone and may be further north. The report was based on a review of evidence by Australian and international experts. Australia has said that it did not view the report findings as credible. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, previously agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the current search area was fully scoured unless "credible new information" emerged. "We cannot just base [a search] on assumptions. We need credible clues to look for the plane," said Liow when asked about the possibility of a search further north. Many families have been long sceptical about whether the ongoing search is in the right place. In a statement late Thursday, the international group of MH370 next-of-kin, Voice 370, called on Malaysia, Australia and China to consider the next step before the current search ends. "Extending the search to the new area defined by experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," it added. A French background check of passengers and crew aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which mysteriously disappeared in 2014, has found no cause for suspicion, concurring sources told AFP on Friday. France has opened its own investigation into the disappearance because four French nationals were among the 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard the flight. The investigators and three examining magistrates met with relatives of the four on Thursday to brief them on progress. The relatives were told that background checks on passengers and crew by France's domestic intelligence agency, the DGSI, "turned up negative," according to sources close to the inquiry. Ghyslain Wattrelos, whose wife and two of his children were onboard, confirmed this account. "They told us that the search didn't turn up anything," he told AFP. Questions about passenger and crew background emerged when the Malaysian authorities said two Iranian passengers on the flight had been travelling on stolen passports. But Interpol said they were most probably migrants trying to reach Europe. At Thursday's meeting, a French specialist also provided the final version of an interim report that had been drawn up in September, "but it didn't say anything that was much new," Wattrelos' lawyer, Marie Dose, said. She praised the examining magistrates for their "remarkable" work. MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.

Grow up. Time to be an adult,” he said in an interview on PBS. “You’re president. You’ve got to do something. Show us what you have. You’re going to propose legislation. We’re going to get to debate it. Let the public decide. Let them vote in Congress. Let’s see what happens.” Biden’s remarks came during a continuing stream of inflammatory Trump tweets, including ones that called Senate Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer a clown, mocked America’s intelligence agencies and gave credit to Internet outlaw Julian Assange, whose WikiLeaks site aided Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election. Biden’s point is exactly right: If he is to be successful in his new role, Trump needs to make the shift from insurgent campaigner and tweeter to president of the world’s superpower. On January 20, as he takes the oath of office and the weight of the presidency falls on his shoulders, Trump will, for the first time in his life, be employed outside his family’s business. At age 70, he will become accountable to the American people who will begin to learn whether this man with no experience in public service is up to the most demanding political job in the world. Big adjustments in a long career Has Trump ever made such a shift in roles? He hasn’t had to reboot himself in anything like the manner now required. But over his long career he has had to make big adjustments. For example, when his companies ran out of money to pay their lenders and filed for bankruptcy in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009, he had to accept the strict terms and oversight required by bankruptcy agreements. The 1991 case was especially chastening, as Trump was even placed on a monthly budget by his creditors. When Mark Burnett came to him with the idea for “The Apprentice” TV show, Trump had to overcome his natural reluctance when it came to firing people (he actually hates doing it). And finally, when he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower in the summer of 2015, he had to assume the role of contender for the Republican party nomination. To woo the hard-right conservatives who provide much of his base in GOP primaries, he had to morph into a right-wing conservative even though he had once favored abortion rights, tax increases and stricter gun control. The pivot that didn’t happen During the election campaign Trump was eagerly watched for signs that he would ease away from his bombast and offer more than rambling displays of emotion to the voters. In other words, we waited for him to become “presidential.” At that time the key word was not “transition” but “pivot,” and Trump’s advisors often predicted that a turn toward normalcy was at hand. At one point Trump himself recognized the need for change and announced, “I will be so presidential you will be so bored. You’ll say, ‘Can’t he have a little more energy?'” The pivot never came. Instead Trump continued to improvise in response to news events, promoting doubt about his opponent while revealing few details about just how he would fulfill his promise to Make America Great Again. The strategy failed to win Trump a majority of votes. Indeed, Hillary Clinton bested him by nearly 2.9 million votes. But thanks to the Electoral College he won anyway. After winning the election Trump remained devoted to his game of gesture and symbols, picking little fights with companies like Boeing and Toyota while foregoing serious work such as learning about national security in the formal briefings presidents have accepted going back to the Kennedy administration. As he neglects his serious duties in favor of indulging himself on Twitter, Trump tells us that he will not change his style merely because he was elected president. Potential to change? A president’s style does matter. And so far, Trump’s tweets have upset those who value stability in world affairs and generosity of spirit in the Oval Office. However the new administration’s policies will matter every bit as much as its tone, and here the President-elect has demonstrated more flexibility than some would expect. When his fellow Republicans moved to neuter the ethics board that oversees Congress, Trump objected and they reversed course. More recently he has observed the rush to repeal the Affordable Care Act and warned the GOP to “be careful” lest they create a problem worse than the one they claim to be fixing. On health care and the ethics office episode, Trump deviated from his party’s orthodoxy and aligned himself with what he believes most American people want. These acts displayed the fact that he is eager to be seen as decisive, and is more concerned with his own popularity than political orthodoxy. This is, after all, the man who just this week referred to himself as a TV “ratings machine” as he criticized his replacement on “The Apprentice,” Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump’s policy adjustments may not show that he is a grownup in the sense that Biden prefers. But they do show he has the potential to transition from candidate to president. He’ll likely remain a crude, insulting and ill-tempered man, but as a president he could still find a way to some success.

The poor countries can retain their oil wells and their coal mines, but the oil wells and coal mines are hollow. Recently, some people have talked about the so-called the "4th industrial revolution" and they said that this revolution will create tremendous benefits from new products and services with negligible costs to serve customers, to make human life easier and more productive. The "Revolution" is expected to be a big trend that will have an impact on economic and social development on a global scale, in every nation, in every region, including Vietnam. It is very disturbing, even dangerous, if we do not have a clear understanding and vision about the nature of the so-called "revolution" because if you accept it without thorough understanding it will lead to mistakes in making policies, economic and social development strategies, which may affect the future and destiny of the country. In 2011, the term "Industry 4.0" appeared for the first time in a high-tech strategy of the German government to promote computerization of production through connecting machines and intelligent control systems. Less than five years later, the concept of "Industry 4.0" was expanded and the 4th industrial revolution was chosen as the theme of the World Economic Forum held in January 2016 in Davos, Switzerland. Many international organizations and scholars, notably Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum 2016, forecasted that "this revolution will fundamentally change the way people live, work, and have connections with each other" [1], so many countries have been considering and building new policies and strategies to be compatible with the 4th industrial revolution. However, there is no clear definition of the so-called the 4th revolution apart from some ideas that it is based on a number of technologies such as the Internet of Things, Internet of service [2], artificial intelligence, cloud computing or 3D printing technology ... [3] First of all, to say a phenomenon becomes a revolution, especially a revolution of global nature, one of the classical methods, the most reliable way is to study the political-economic nature of the phenomenon. By definition, a revolution is the elimination of the old in order to replace with the new and the more progressive thing. It implies fundamental, radical and significant changes with widespread impact occurring in a relatively short time, and in particular, there is a fundamental change of productive forces and production relations, including the ownership of material for production and production tools as well as the division of labor. Production forces Human history has witnessed three revolutions: the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution and the IT revolution, which created the agricultural economy, the industrial economy and the knowledge-based economy, respectively, making fundamental change in the way people work and produce. The 4th industrial revolution is said to be based on the development of many technologies, especially the Internet of Things, cloud computing and information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing technology, automation ..., so in terms of technology, it is IT. Therefore, we can say that the so-called 4th industrial revolution is the next stage of development of the IT revolution, not anything else. Changes in production methods through IT like e-working, e-learning, e-business, e-government, machines replacing people, and virtualization ... have been discussed extensively in the academic article on the IT revolution, so we will not mention it in this article. The biggest difference compared to other revolutions, if it occurs, is located in a change in the relations of production, especially possession, possession of production tools, production materials and the division of labor, although the change has taken place since the service revolution began in the 1960s, which developed particularly strongly in the late 20th century and early 21st century, in the so-called "knowledge-based economy". Speaking broadly, the knowledge-based economy is an economy creating human capital, including knowledge-based goods and services, with intangible nature and high exchange value (for example electronics, computer software, training, consulting, loans ...) in exchange for other goods, including material goods, mainly natural capital. The exchanges are protected through national, multinational and international institutions via trade agreements, notably WTO trade agreements. If in the industrial economy of the 19th century, the means of production belonged to employers, and workers did not hold materials for production and both subjects were in the same country, in the current knowledge-based economy, materials for production and production tools belong to rich countries, or multinational groups of rich countries, while employees and workers are in the poor countries. Thus, in the knowledge-based economy of the 21st century, there is a change in the division of labor globally instead of the division of labor in the national territory and this leads to a divergence between rich countries and poor countries rather than the differentiation between the capitalist class and the proletariat of the 19th century and the class contradictions within a nation have gradually been replaced by conflicts between nations. Some may say that this argument runs counter to the trend of globalization, with many new kinds of trade agreements. However, the phenomenon of nationalism and protectionism is gradually spreading in many countries such as China, Russia, the Brexit in the UK, Duterte in the Philippines or Trump in the US. These are testament to this trend.  The poor in poor countries seek to counteract this trend by moving to rich countries to become citizens of rich countries. This has resulted in immigration movements that are taking place in Europe and this is a typical example of the new movement of nationalism and protectionism. A new point in the knowledge-based economy is the change in the way of appropriating materials for production and natural resources. Many scholars believe that the knowledge-based economy is non-physical economy, under which knowledge of high-value is more important than material goods. Therefore the economic sectors based on high technology must occupy higher positions than the traditional sectors such as agriculture, mining. Economic development strategies have to give priority for the new technology sectors like the 4th industrial revolution. The question is whether the people in rich countries need to eat, wear, and use material goods or not? I'm sure the answer is yes. However, how will they get this kind of goods? By means of exchange of knowledge goods or services to obtain material goods (what I call exchange of Mind for Mass). Notably, the method of exchange is always unequal, discrimination between material goods and immaterial goods. The "double standards" in globalization are showed through a variety of WTO’s institutions such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) [5]. These double standards have been manifested more clearly in the neoliberal trade agreements such the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In these agreements, material goods subjected to the HS code for across-border control, quality control and other kinds of control while the knowledge goods and services such as IT services and e-commerce do not bear an HS code, so when they are exchanged cross-border, they are not under any control, no tax pressure, as well as no quality barriers. Another important point in the knowledge-based economy is that material goods always have cheap value (although the price can be very high), even very cheap compared to non-physical goods. A typical example:  the value of Vietnam’s 2.6 tons of rice is equal to one iPhone 7+ cell phone. And how many tons of rice Vietnam should be sold to buy a Boeing 787 Dreamliner? The difference in price is completely contrary to the most basic rules of the traditional economy, the law of value and the law of supply and demand in economic theories, including the theory of Marx. According to the law of value, the production and exchange of goods are based on necessary social labor consumption, while under the law on supply and demand, the price of goods depends on the adjustment of the market when it reaches a balance between supply and demand. Under these rules, high-value goods are goods with high demand or goods with scarce supply or have high social labor consumption and vice versa. However, in reality, material goods are always in high demand. There are many commodities that are used just onetime by one user, thus they are becoming scarce, even permanently exhausted. Knowledge goods are not scarce at all. A software, a service, an intellectual product can be copied for the use of a lot of people multiple times. This shortage is artificially created through provisions on the protection of intellectual property. Thus, in the knowledge-based economy, the institutions are contrary to the most basic economic laws of supply – demand and value, signaling a wrong signal about the abundance of material goods and the scarcity of non-material goods, while it supposes to be the opposite. Thus, the knowledge-based economy is benefiting the rich, who own production materials. Concerning labor: manual labor is gradually replaced by special machines and robots. New technologies may be able to create new jobs, but might not create new jobs. The replacement of humans by machines, especially IT and automation, will become more intense, leading to worsening unemployment, especially low-skilled workers, if we don’t have timely and appropriate responses. Therefore, the training of human resources in terms of knowledge and new technologies as well as building an environment that supports innovation is vital to adapt to the technology revolution. The fundamental change of the knowledge-based economy has led to the risk of resource depletion, threatening the survival of poor countries while the rich countries can keep resources for the future, which were sucked from poor countries like a spider that stretches its trunk to suck all the blood of its prey clean until death without directly invading these countries. Poor countries like Vietnam can retain their oil wells and coal mines, but they become hollow wells and mines. Thus, the 4th industrial revolution is just one phase of the IT revolution, the knowledge-based economy. The knowledge-based economy is the development of the capitalist economic model with fundamental changes on value creation, resource possession and global division of labor. These fundamental changes will require Vietnam to soon have thorough, comprehensive and timely studies about this economy in order to have appropriate policies.  Dr. Nguyen Thanh Tuyen and MA.

January 16, 2017 0251 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:175332 Publish Date: Sun, 08 Jan 2017 18:45:14 GMT Service: Iran Iran takes ownership of first passenger jet under sanctions deal Airbus said on Sunday Iran's state airline Iran Air had accepted its first new jet, marking a key step in opening up trade under a nuclear sanctions deal between Iran and major powers. The Airbus A321 jetliner has been painted in Iran Air livery and is expected to be delivered later this week, reported Reuters. "The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done," a spokesman for the European planemaker said. Iranian regulators said the aircraft had been placed on the country's aircraft register, indicating Iran Air had taken ownership of the aircraft: The first of around 200 Western aircraft ordered since sanctions were lifted. "The registration has been done, and the delivery should be by the end of the week," Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Reuters by telephone. The 189-seat jet was assembled in Hamburg, Germany. From there, it is expected to be transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for a formal handover on Wednesday. Iran Air Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told IRNA that there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the Airbus jetliner in Tehran later this week. Iran Air has ordered 100 passenger jets from Airbus and 80 from its US rival Boeing under the nuclear deal, which called for the lifting of most international sanctions in exchange for modification on Iran's nuclear activities. Boeing also agreed last year to arrange the leasing of a further 29 aircraft. Iran Air is also negotiating a final agreement with European turbo-prop maker ATR. The company, joint-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, has provisionally agreed to supply 20 of its 70-seat regional planes with options for a further 20.     KeyWords Airbus jet Iran   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, intl. community condemn Bahrain’s execution of three activists Iran favors peace, stability promotion in Balkans: Rouhani Iran supports dialogue to resolve Iraq problems Iraq seeking to improve Iran-Saudi Arabia ties Sri Lanka eager to resume Iran oil imports Iran’s Mehrzad, Rahman Ones to Watch for 2017 Iran, Albania keen on cooperation Nuclear deal bolstered Iran’s global image Iran’s Esteghlal signs Uzbek midfielder Djeparov Iran volleyball skipper faces ban Most Visited Obama extends national emergency on Iran US will 'shoot down' North Korean missiles: Pentagon chief Pentagon deploys 300 Marines to Afghanistan's Helmand www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0702 sec

The plane, an A321 class, was officially registered under Iran Air ownership on Saturday, CEO Farhad Parvaresh said. The plane will arrive and will be operated by an Iran Air team who have been attending Airbus flight operations training courses in France for months, said Parvaresh. “Iran Air has made necessary arrangements for the incoming A321 to be used for domestic flights, nevertheless it could also be used for international flights if required,” he said. According to reports, this would be Iran’s first brand-new plane in over 37 years. The country’s current fleet is comprised of planes purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. All post-1979 purchases that were made with a variety of providers involved second-hand planes. In December, Iran sealed a contract with Airbus to buy 100 aircraft worth over $18 billion. Parvaresh said that Iran Air will receive seven or eight planes from Airbus in 2017. He hoped that the delivery would be made in due time. In January 2016, Iran signed a preliminary agreement with Airbus to purchase 106 commercial planes. However, the agreement waited for the US Treasury Department’s go-ahead license which was issued in November. In December, Iran Air also finalised an agreement with Boeing to purchase 80 commercial planes. The agreement envisages the purchase of 50 twin-jet narrow-body Boeing 737 planes and 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft with a total value of $16.6 billion. The planes by Boeing would be delivered to Iran within 10 years, Parvaresh said, adding that the first deliveries are expected in 2018. –IANS ksk/vt Tags Iran Air plane receive used CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Don't be flippant with Indian symbols, Amazon told Jan 15th, 201707 New Delhi, Jan 15 (IANS) Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das on Sunday asked e-tailer Amazon to...

The Iran Air officials announced on Sunday that they have received the first Airbus 321 plane, adding that it is being prepared to fly to the country.  Iranian Deputy Transportation Minister Asqar Fakhrieh Kashan announced late last month that Airbus and the ATR companies will deliver 8 new passenger planes to Iran Air by the end of this year. "Based on the contract signed with Airbus, the company will deliver one A320 and two long-range A330 planes to Iran Air by the end of this (Iranian) year (ending on March 20)," Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Iran Air will receive 8 new Airbus and ATR planes by the end of this year," he added. Airbus sealed a contract with Iran Air in December to sell 100 of its passenger planes, worth over $18 billion. The announcement came after Iran Air Managing Director Farhad Parvaresh and Airbus President Fabrice Bregier finalized a deal which was initially signed in Paris back in January 2016. The agreement covered 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft, with deliveries due to begin in early 2017. Airbus is the world’s Number 2 jet maker after Boeing, a US-based multinational plane manufacturer. Bregier described the deal as “a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector,” saying it also includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management. Parvaresh, for his part, expressed delight at cooperation with Airbus, stressing it has paved the way “for more practical steps to follow for Iran Air’s fleet renewal.” "Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation. We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration,” he added. The deal with Airbus received the go-ahead from the US Treasury Department in November. Early in December, Iran Air finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from US plane maker Boeing Co., with the planes scheduled to start arriving in 2018. The deals were made possible after the US removed a ban on selling Iran passenger aircraft and spare parts following the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Tehran and the six world powers (the US, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany) hammered out the nuclear accord in July 2015. It went into effect in January 2016 and resolved a long-running dispute over Iran’s peaceful nuclear program.         Related News Minister: Iran to Receive 20 New Passenger Planes Soon  Iran Attracts over $7bln of Finance from 3 Foreign Banks  Deputy Minister: Iran Air to Receive 8 New Passenger Planes from Airbus, ATR by Yearend  Envoy: Airbus Contract to Bolster Iran's Financial Ties with Europe  Iran Air to Purchase 100 Passenger Planes From Airbus  LATEST STORIES (8) Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed Syrian Army Repels ISIL's Massive Attack on Gov't Positions in Deir Ezzur City Week of Protests Kicks off with Rallies in DC, Chicago, California Libyan National Army's Fight against ISIL in Benghazi Syria: Buses Arrive to Evacuate Civilians and Militants from Wadi Bardi Syria: Aleppo's Famous Bazaar Reopens after Two Years of Closure Iranians Pay Tribute to Late Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani Bahrainis Simmering with Anger over Death Verdicts A Timeless American Tradition: Trump, Syria, and Giving in to Flinching Senior MP Renews Iran's Support for Political Solution to Iraq's Problems Iranian Speaker's Advisor Blasts Bahraini Regime for Executing Youth France Warns US about Serious Consequences over Embassy Relocation Senior Taliban Commander among 21 Killed in Security Operations across Afghanistan Eastern Ghouta: Syrian Army Tightens Up Grip on Terrorists in Wadi Al-Bardi, Recaptures Key Height Local Germans Want US Tanks to 'Get Out' Bahrain: Protests Erupt after 3 Shiite Men Executed TEHRAN (FNA)- Clashes erupted between police and protesters in Sanabis, Sunday, after news broke that Bahrain had executed three anti-regime activists who were convicted over their alleged role in a 2014 bomb attack.

REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl PARIS/DUBAI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Airbus said on Sunday Iran's state airline IranAir had accepted its first new jet, marking a key step in opening up trade under a nuclear sanctions deal between Iran and major powers. The Airbus A321 jetliner has been painted in IranAir livery and is expected to be delivered later this week. "The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done," a spokesman for the European planemaker said. Iranian regulators said the aircraft had been placed on the country's aircraft register, indicating IranAir had taken ownership of the aircraft: the first of around 200 Western aircraft ordered since sanctions were lifted. "The registration has been done, and the delivery should be by the end of the week," Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Reuters by telephone.

IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told state news agency IRNA there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the Airbus jetliner in Tehran later this week. IranAir has ordered 100 passenger jets from Airbus and 80 from its U.S. rival Boeing under the nuclear deal, which called for the lifting of most international sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.

The Airbus A321 jetliner has been painted in IranAir livery and is expected to be delivered later this week. "The technical acceptance has been done with formal delivery still to be done," a spokesman for the European planemaker said. Iranian regulators said the aircraft had been placed on the country's aircraft register, indicating IranAir had taken ownership of the aircraft: the first of around 200 Western aircraft ordered since sanctions were lifted. "The registration has been done, and the delivery should be by the end of the week," Reza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told Reuters by telephone. The 189-seat jet was assembled in Hamburg, Germany. From there, it is expected to be transferred to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for a formal handover on Wednesday. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh told state news agency IRNA there would be an official ceremony to mark the arrival of the Airbus jetliner in Tehran later this week. IranAir has ordered 100 passenger jets from Airbus and 80 from its U.S. rival Boeing under the nuclear deal, which called for the lifting of most international sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Boeing also agreed last year to arrange the leasing of a further 29 aircraft. IranAir is also negotiating a final agreement with European turbo-prop maker ATR. The company, joint-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, has provisionally agreed to supply 20 of its 70-seat regional planes with options for a further 20.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Every post-election week with Donald Trump feels like an eternity. The details change but the story stays the same: Trump whines, lies and pleads for attention, scrambling facts, fiction and conspiracy into a fatiguing, but now familiar blend. Last week followed the same formula, with Trump pretending not to know what he knows and to be an expert in everything he doesn’t know, all while waging petty wars using time that could be spent boning up on policy. He ended the week with an intelligence briefing (we’ve sunk so low, PEOTUS doing his job qualifies as news), but it did little to markedly shift the tone. And in that tone is the message, "We are so screwed." So we don’t forget, here’s a look back at just 10 of Trump’s most recent lies and fails. 1. Calling for an investigation of NBC instead of the Russian hacks. Trump’s denial of Russian cyberattacks in the face of tremendous evidence may be because he 1) actually thinks he knows more than the generals do; 2) is the ultimate Putin fanboy and debtor to Russia; or 3) is a Kremlin puppet. Add to this the fact that Trump refuses to have daily intelligence briefings because he’s “like, a smart person,” and the knowledge gap makes yet more sense. After making a big show of his disinterest in national security issues, Trump got huffy after NBC News offered a sneak peek into the findings detailed in an intelligence report on the Russian hacks. Though he’s steadfastly stood against an investigation into Russian cyberespionage against American democracy, he’s now calling for an investigation into “top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.” He cares because he was left out. Trump only wants to be in a club that won’t have him as a member. After finally sitting down to be briefed by intelligence officials Friday, Trump released a statement saying the meeting was "constructive," but he still failed to focus on Russia as the primary culprit, talking in circles. He announced that he'll be putting together a team to broadly combat cyberattacks, but said nothing about digging into the hacking the entire rest of the country wants to know about.  2. Making personal calls instead of doing his friggin’ job. A bitter, pathetic man who has dedicated his life to seeking revenge, Trump is still duking it out with Ohio governor John Kasich, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race nearly a year ago. Instead of attending to the things an incoming president should be, Trump took a break from hate-tweeting at TV shows to make personal phone calls to Ohio voters, all because he wants a Kasich-backed candidate to lose in the state GOP race. Funny what he finds time for. 3. Accepting Julian Assange’s word over 17 intelligence agencies. Trump doubts the experts of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies who contend they have concrete proof of Russian hacking, and thinks we should just go with Wikileaks founder and rape suspect Julian Assange on this one. Trump sent multiple tweets this week pushing Assange’s claims on the matter, along with bloviations from Fox News blowhard Sean Hannity. When called out on it, Trump tweeted, “The media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!” 4. Admitting he duped his know-nothing voter base on the border wall, then lying again. As was apparent to any non-delusional person since Trump launched his campaign, there is no way Mexico is going to pay for Trump’s big, dumb wall. Trump, correctly estimating the sky-high gullibility of his base, knew this the whole time. In recent days, his team reportedly told House Republicans “that [Trump’s] preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process,” i.e., taxpayer dollars. After news leaked that Trump’s central campaign promise was a big lie, he told another lie to cover it up, insisting, “that any money spent on building the Great Wall…will be paid back by Mexico later!” Except no, it won’t. You can’t just invoice a country for your nonsense bad ideas, sorry. 5. Lying about having a hand in every job-saving deal. Trump has lied about creating or saving jobs for Sprint, Carrier and Ford. 6. But refusing to take credit for job losses. After Macy’s responded to Trump’s racist comments about Mexicans by removing his clothing line from the store (though his daughter Ivanka’s label is still sold there), he demanded his supporters boycott the department store chain for being “disloyal.” Whether that boycott was the source of Macy’s recent financial woes is up for debate, but since Trump has taken credit where it definitely isn’t due for the last 18 months (and pretty much his whole life), he deserves at least part of the blame for the 10,000 job cuts and 68 store closings the retailer announced days ago. That’s also true for Boeing, which saw stocks tumble after Trump tweeted negatively about it because he was angry about a magazine article. The company has announced it’s cutting 8 percent of jobs in 2017. And what about the 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores that are shuttering? Or the jobs McDonald’s is outsourcing to India? Not a peep from Trump, despite that fact that those unemployment numbers will be absorbed by the working class he lies about defending. All in all, the thousands of people who will be losing their jobs far outpaces the people whose jobs Trump only pretended to save.  7. Calling Democratic senator Chuck Shumer a 'clown,' then saying we need to unite 9 minutes later. The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017   …time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works – much less expensive & FAR BETTER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 8. Throwing Obama’s political ambassadors and their families out on short notice. According to the New York Times, Trump’s team has “issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day…breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.” There are reportedly “no exceptions,” including those previously granted to ambassadors who will need to uproot their families, especially those with school-age kids. The Times reports that the Trump decision “threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain.” “It feels like there’s an element just of spite and payback in it,” Derek Shearer, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland, told the newspaper. “I don’t see a higher policy motive.” 9. Scheduling a news conference to distract from his appointee hearings. Trump tweeted a few days ago that he “will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C.” That means nothing, considering Trump is a pathological liar who promises things all the time. Still, this press conference may happen, if only because it’s scheduled the same day as confirmation hearings for his cabinet picks. As Media Matters notes: “The strategy seems designed to ensure that the media is unable to devote sufficient scrutiny to each story and to reduce the possibility of an educated public responding…[B]y refusing to give a press conference for so long…Trump has created such a backlog of potential issues that it will be impossible for reporters to give all of them the time and coverage they deserve. Meanwhile, McConnell has done his best to fracture journalist attention by ensuring that six different confirmation hearings are scheduled for the same day…Several of these nominations are extremely controversial…But with all the hearings stacked on the same day, on top of Trump’s press conference, it’s impossible for the media to provide the information people need. And that’s the point—it appears to be a deliberate effort to manipulate both the press and the public.” 10. Still publicly smarting about being dissed by all the cool-kid pop stars for his little inauguration thing. He’s super bad at playing it cool.  Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance. Some people just don't understand the "Movement" — Donald J.

(Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) SEATTLE -- He turned the corner in a flash, sheathed in an avocado-green suit and matching fedora. He wore braids made of lime-green confetti and Seahawk-blue beads hung from his neck. Tracy Baublits stopped foot traffic with his day-glo get-up as he weaved through the packed streets hugging CenturyLink Field Stadium early Saturday afternoon before the Detroit Lions played the Seahawks in a wild-card playoff game won by Seattle. It was cold and damp, and his presence elicited “Seahawks!” chants as he dodged the crush of tailgaters. It felt like a tableau from Mardi Gras. Fans were decked in face paint and Seahawks colors, of course, but many had added more personal statements — wigs, fake beards, cleats, jewelry. None, however, cut a figure like Baublits, a 6-foot-4 walking advertisement for the hypercrazed 12th man, Seattle’s famed self-named fan base. “People expect me to be here,” said the 52-year-old from Fife, Wash., a small town near Tacoma some 30 miles south of Seattle. “I’ve been a season-ticket holder for 10 years.” The 12th man phenomenon predates him by a half-dozen years, but the identity as the NFL’s most vociferous fan base didn’t take hold until the team started making noise in the playoffs. Seattle lost its NBA team eight years ago and doesn’t have an NHL franchise. Soccer is popular here — the MLS team, the Sounders, recently won the MLS Cup — and the Washington Huskies have a sizeable fan base. Lions fans Grason and Kristen Edsinger in the fan zone before the Lions-Seahawks game Saturday in Seattle.  (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) The Mariners, meanwhile, have been nothing more than a tease the past couple of decades. Forging memorable regular seasons before flaming out in the postseason. All of this is to say that with the exception of the Sonics, who won an NBA title in 1979, this region hasn’t had a championship team until these Seahawks bullied their way to a Super Bowl win three years ago. That brought the region a kind of visceral civic pride that coffee chains and billionaire software techies couldn’t achieve. So say fans like Baublits, anyway, who spent most of the pregame party surrounding the stadium posing for pictures and piloting a remote-controlled buggy dragging a Lions doll behind it. Remote control car with Lions effigy doll Saturday in Seattle.  (Photo: Shawn Windsor, Detroit Free Press) “It’s my effigy doll,” he said, smiling. It’s not hard to imagine a similar scene unfolding in Detroit, filling the streets that funnel to Ford Field with a sort of unhinged revelry. Brian Anderson can see it now. A sea of silver and Honolulu blue. Fans spotting each other at the airport, in coffee shops, on the streets of metro Detroit, hollering out “Go Lions!” in the same way Seahawks recognize each other here. From the minute I landed late Friday afternoon, I’ve heard the Seahawks chants, rode buses with fans wearing scarves, knit caps and knee-high green and blue socks, watched as this whole town raised its fists in solidarity at the prospect of another extended playoff run. Speaking of fists, a food-trailer by the stadium was adorned with one holding a cheeseburger. It was called “The People’s Burger,” and it offered local ground beef patties slathered in Che Guevara consciousness. “Win or lose they are together,” said Brian Anderson, a Boeing inspector in nearby Everett who wore a Matthew Stafford jersey as he stood near the burger joint. Wait … what? Yes, Anderson was wearing a Lions jersey. He grew up near Ironwood in the Upper Peninsula. He moved out west three decades ago. Still, the Honolulu-and-silver stuck. It did, too, for brothers Dean and Darryl Robinson, 52-year-old twins who grew up in Southgate and left for a life in the Army. Dean served 28 years and Darryl 10. Both did stints in Iraq. Seahawks fans walk to the game against the Lions Saturday in Seattle.  (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) They are out now, and settled in the Pacific Northwest for its obvious livability standards. Yet they remain Detroiters in spirit, and in the sports teams they follow. Both sported Lions jerseys Saturday and hung near a bar spilling forth with fellow Lions fans. As much as they love their hometown team and its fan base, they admire what Seattle has built. “It’s a community,” Dean Robinson said. “They show up through and through. Back home, we talk about SOL — “Same Old Lions” — but here it’s different.” From left: Dean Robinson, Jerod Banner and Darryl Robinson -- all live in Seattle area. The Robinsons are twins and grew up in Southgate. Both served in the U.S. Army.  (Photo: Shawn Windsor, Detroit Free Press) Both brothers are convinced Detroit could offer a similar NFL experience if the Lions every truly made a Super Bowl run. Or, managed to host a playoff game. The truest connections are built when teams give their fans memorable moments. The Seahawks rose up and did this the past several years. “We can compete with these guys, no doubt,” Robinson said. “We have the blue-collar base.” They just don’t have the history. Not the right kind, anyway. All they need is an opportunity. Contact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.

Valerie Insinna writes James told the publication the F/A-18 and F-35 aircraft “fulfill different requirements” since as former is a fourth-generation platform while the latter is a fifth-generation airplane. “The leaders of the Air Force will have the opportunity when the time comes to advise the president-elect on this,” James added. “But based on everything I know, the two are not interchangeable and the Air Force has not expressed interest in the F/A-18s,” she noted. James said she believes President-elect Donald Trump sought to reduce costs in his meetings with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson.

Photos Videos Topics Live NZ 91/2 (19) - BAN 160/9 (57.5) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi BCCI Dangal Tej Bahadur Singh Mahendra Singh Dhoni Home India No airspace data sharing with Pakistan Shares128 Shahkar Abidi | Mon, 9 Jan 2017-06:55am , Mumbai , DNA As per the aviation experts, air traffic service providers and regulators worldwide are moving from radar based surveillance to ADS-B to track air planes in flight and on the ground more accurately and reliably With bilateral relations between India-Pakistan continuing to remain fragile, the trust deficit emanating out of it is likely to affect the co-operation in civil aviation airspace. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) which is planning to install Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), a surveillance based technology for civil aviation safety on buoyancy all around the country's oceanic boundaries has recently showed its apprehension to UN backed International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), about sharing the data with its hostile neighbour. The insiders feel that data which has live update about the exact positions of the aircraft apart from other sensitive details may be misused by anti-social or non-state actors from the country to harm India's interests. "We have informed ICAO of our apprehensions in regard to sharing of data which is going to be tremendous in near future," said PK Bandopadhyay, ED (Planning), CNS, AAI during DISHA, a seminar held in Delhi to discuss the development of indigenous technologies in civil aviation. Talking about installing ADS-B on water using buoyancy Bandopadhyay said, "It will make the plane constantly remain in contact with the ground." ICAO has been asking the airlines and aviation regulators around the world to develop a foolproof mechanism by way of which the aircraft's position and its related data can be continuously tracked at all time when the plane is in air. The demand gained thrust after a Malaysian airline plane MH370 went missing in 2014 without an iota of trace, leading the investigators high and dry. As per the aviation experts, air traffic service providers and regulators worldwide are moving from radar based surveillance to ADS-B to track air planes in flight and on the ground more accurately and reliably. However, the changes require are to be equipped in new and existing planes, which obviously come at a premium, which many of the domestic airlines in India at present are trying to avoid in absence of any regulation related to it. "The domestic airlines so far have been hesitant in installation of the equipment, specially in the age of cost cutting and savings," said a senior Communication and Navigation System (CNS) official from Mumbai. What ADS-B does As per a report prepared by aircraft manufacturer Boeing on ADS-B uses a combination of satellites, transmitters, and receivers to provide both flight crews and ground control personnel with very specific information about the location and speed of air planes in the area. The aviation legal experts though India is a member of UN backed aviation treaties and conventions which mandates sharing of information among the member nations, a country can withhold some information which are not general in nature. However, the common information needs to be shared.

Options include subjecting well-known U.S. companies or ones with large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust probes, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Other possible measures include anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, the people said. The move illustrates how the fallout from escalating tensions between the two nations risks spreading to companies. Trump has made China a frequent target of his attacks and nominated trade-related officials who the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper said would form an “iron curtain” of protectionism. Any retaliation by China against Trump stands to be risky. A backlash may result in China damaging access to its biggest trading partner, said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. “When you have a country with a large trade deficit that retaliates against a country with a large trade surplus with it, it’s the country with the trade deficit that wins,” said Every. “The country with the surplus loses, every time.” America’s trade deficit with China narrowed to USD31.1 billion from $32.5 billion in October as U.S. exports to the nation were the strongest since December 2013, according to the most recent data available. That brought the trade deficit to $288.78 billion for the 10 months to the end of October. China’s central government compiled the possible countermeasures after collecting opinions from various departments, the people said. The punitive steps would only be carried out if the U.S. acts first and after senior Chinese leaders sign off on them, they said. In response to Bloomberg queries, China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen highlighted the benefits of maintaining good bilateral relations, saying that U.S. investments have not only helped Chinese employment but have also led to immense wealth for American companies. “I believe win-win economic ties between the two nations will keep moving forward,” Wang said. “No one wants a lose-lose scenario, and no one will want to harm the win-win ties. I’m still optimistic about future China-U.S. economic relations.” Wang also said the Ministry of Commerce will seek to level the playing field for foreign companies pitching to win government contracts and that it wouldn’t discriminate against foreign companies’ products made in China. Representatives at China’s State Administration of Taxation and General Administration of Customs either didn’t respond or couldn’t immediately comment to Bloomberg queries. Representatives at Trump’s transition team didn’t respond to a request for comment. Late last year, China fined General Motors Co., the second- largest foreign carmaker in the country, nearly $30 million for antitrust violations after the company was accused of setting minimum prices on some models made by its SAIC General Motors joint venture. GM said at the time it respects local laws and that it would fully support its venture in China to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Given how much they have at stake – Rhodium Group estimates American multinational corporations have poured more than $228 billion into China since 1990 – U.S. business groups have a history of pushing back against Washington on trade issues with China. In the 1990s, companies including Boeing Co., Motorola Inc. and American International Group Inc. were involved in lobbying efforts in the annual battle to renew China’s most-favored nation status that gave its exports low-tariff status in the U.S. In 2011, trade groups representing companies including Microsoft Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. lobbied against legislation to pressure China to raise the value of its currency. “Discriminating against foreign companies in the enforcement of laws and regulations harms not just those companies, but also the millions of Chinese who work for them, their local partners and those who use their products and services,” said William Zarit, chairman of the Beijing-based American Chamber of Commerce in China. “We urge the governments of both countries to find ways to build trust through increasing transparency, and to establish a level trade and commercial playing field. “ Bloomberg Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Categories China Share This Post Related Posts Critics attacked, history revised as China nationalism rises Father of Chinese Romanization, dies at 111 Paper calls Tillerson’s South Sea threat ‘foolish’ Hong Kong | No. 2 official quits, becomes favorite for top post No Comments Cancel Reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Monday, 16 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview Iran to Get First Purchased Airbus Aircraft Thursday News ID: 1291261 Service: Economy January, 08, 2017 - 16:18 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iran will receive the first jetliner from a series of aircraft it has bought from European plane manufacturer Airbus on Thursday, January 12, an official announced. Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh said on Sunday that the brand-new passenger plane, an A321, is expected to land in Tehran on Thursday. The plane will take off from Germany’s Hamburg with Iranian pilots, he noted, saying it will be used for domestic flights. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Iran and Airbus intensified business negotiations in October 2016 following the US decision to remove a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers to sell planes to Iran under contracts signed after coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France and Germany). While Western plane makers are very keen on trade with Iran, Washington still demands that even non-American manufacturers wishing to sell to Iran obtain an export license if their products include materials made in the United States. Airbus, based in Europe, buys more than 40 percent of all its aircraft parts from the US. Iran sealed another deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In December, the deal with Boing was finalized, allowing Iran to buy 80 planes within 10 years. The first deliveries are expected in 2018.

By: AFP | Tehran | Published:January 8, 2017 6:25 pm Iran is to take possession of the first aircraft this week in a huge order from Airbus placed after the lifting of international sanctions, state carrier Iran Air said Sunday. “This aircraft has received its certificate of registration and an Iran Air team is in place to take delivery of it,” the airline’s chief executive officer, Farhad Parvaresh, told the Fars news agency. “We hope to take delivery between now and the end of the week.” Iran Air completed the huge deal for 100 Airbus planes with a list price of around USD 20 billion (19 billion euros) on December 22.
