The deal includes the first two “production lots” of 7 and 12 planes respectively, as well as spare parts. Including future options, Boeing plans to build a total of 179 of the 767-based refueling aircraft for the Air Force to replace their KC-135 fleet. “The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force with unprecedented refueling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness,” said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO. “It’s an important day for the company and program. We’re excited about building low-rate initial production aircraft, and it’s only possible because of the hard work of the joint Boeing-Air Force team.” The deal follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 program completed “Milestone C” - a set of required ground and flight-test tests - and is approved for initial production.  Those tests included refueling flights with F- 16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17 and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo. Boeing received an initial contract in 2011 to design and develop the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation tanker aircraft. As part of that contract Boeing built four test aircraft – two configured as 767-2Cs and two as KC-46A tankers. The test aircraft have completed more than 1,000 flight hours to date. The KC-46A is a multirole tanker that can refuel all allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refueling procedures and can carry passengers, cargo and patients. Boeing is assembling KC-46 aircraft at its Everett, Wash., facility. The company will begin delivering tankers to the Air Force in 2017.

Will it win the gold? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 21, 2016 at 10:13AM Destination: International Space Station. But who will win the gold medal for getting there first? Image source: NASA. Two years ago, NASA tapped Boeing (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX to run Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) missions for it, ferrying U.S. astronauts from Earth to the International Space Station and back. According to the agency, this switch from NASA-operated (or Roscosmos) taxi service to the ISS will save U.S. taxpayers tens of millions of dollars annually. This is because, ever since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, we've been paying Russia to send our astronauts to the ISS -- at a price that now stands at $82 million per seat. In contrast, once up and running, the CCtCap service promises to drop that cost down below $60 million. The terms According to the terms of the contracts, each contractor will be required to: Conduct "at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one NASA astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch, maneuver in orbit, and dock to the space station." Prove that all systems aboard its respective spacecraft "perform as expected." "Once each company's test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves NASA certification, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station." But while both companies won contracts, it was pretty clear which firm NASA favored. All contractors are equal, but some more than others Last year in May and December, NASA awarded Boeing orders for the first two CCtCap missions it is guaranteed under its contract. In contrast, SpaceX got only one order last year in November. It had to wait until July of this year to receive its second, bringing it up to even with Boeing in orders secured. With that award, NASA fulfilled its minimum obligation to place two orders with each contractor. (Note that these will be separate from and subsequent to each company's initial flight test). Now, mind you, none of these four orders have dates attached to them. NASA has not yet decided precisely when they will go up, saying only that "orders... are made two to three years prior to actual mission dates in order to provide time for each company to manufacture and assemble the launch vehicle and spacecraft." That implies that the first private, manned mission to ISS may take place as early as May 2017 or as late as May 2018 (if awarded to Boeing). Nor is it certain which of the two companies will win the honor of making the first private, manned mission into space. It might be Boeing or it might be SpaceX. But given the timing of the awards so far, it looks like NASA is leaning toward Boeing. And some contractors are less equal That's curious because, to date, it actually looks like SpaceX is doing a better job on the CCtCap contract -- and cheaper, too. Earlier this summer, Boeing announced that delays in its program will prevent it from conducting its initial manned flight test (again, this is prior to its two actual delivery missions) until Feb. 2018 at the earliest. That makes it impossible for Boeing to launch its first delivery mission by the optimistic May 2017 date. It leaves an awfully small window to squeeze through if NASA is hoping for Boeing to send a full complement of four astronauts plus 220 pounds of cargo in May 2018 of that year. One more delay and Boeing could miss its window entirely. In contrast, SpaceX, which has also suffered delays, still says it will be ready to conduct its flight test by Aug. 2017. If SpaceX hits that target, it would leave ample time for the company to conduct its first delivery mission by Nov. 2018 (three years post-order), or even Nov. 2017 (two years). Indeed, it's not out of the realm of possibility that, if NASA was hoping to launch in both Nov. and Dec. 2017, SpaceX could fulfill both those launches. Less equal and more expensive All of that is even more curious in light of the dollar amounts involved in these contracts. While both Boeing and SpaceX were given identical missions to conduct with similar spacecraft, the fees the companies will receive couldn't be more different. For the same work, NASA has promised to pay Boeing $4.2 billion, but SpaceX only $2.6 billion. That decision is going to start looking pretty strange if Aug. 2017 rolls around, and SpaceX has its spaceship up and ready for launch, while Boeing is still fiddling around under the hood of its more expensive spacecraft. If that's how things look a year from now, there's going to be a lot of pressure on NASA to go ahead and give SpaceX the honor of conducting the world's first private, manned spaceflight to ISS (and the money from that contract as well). So what's the upshot here for investors? Ultimately, both Boeing and SpaceX are making progress, and both will probably, eventually launch. But SpaceX does appear to be making more progress and at a more affordable cost. In the long run, this is not looking like good news for Boeing's space business.

PM Modi's auctioned suit enters Guinness Book of World Records Mob justice: 2 goons thrashed to death in Bihar TAL to serve Boeing and Airbus from MihanShishir Arya | TNN | Aug 21, 2016, 04.47 AM IST NAGPUR: Tata Group's TAL Manufacturing Solutions, which started off as a unit to make floor beams for Boeing Dreamliners in Mihan, inaugurated a facility for making spares to be used in Airbus' aircraft, on Saturday. The event coincided with a function to deliver the 5000th floor beam to Boeing. This makes TAL probably the only unit which is catering to both Boeing and Airbus, the two Aviation giants and also rivals, under a single roof. The supply to Airbus will be through Switzerland-based Ruag Aviation, a tier one supplier to the aircraft maker. The ceremony was attended by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union minister for surface transport as well as Member of Parliament (MP) from Nagpur, Nitin Gadkari. TAL, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors, eyes to take its turnover to Rs1,000 crore in the next five years as against the current Rs200 crore. A chunk of the business is expected from the Mihan plant. "There are plans to start another workshop for making generic components for original equipment makers (OEMs) in the coming two years," said TAL's chief executive officer Rajesh Khatri. For Ruag, the company will be making sheet metals, machine parts and assemblies. TAL has evolved in this sector with time. "The additional workshop, which has been planned two years from now, is likely to be used for making advanced components," said Khatri. The TAL chief sees a major opportunity in the sector. If the global average is 4%, in India aviation sector has seen a growth of 22%. TAL will have also have an early mover advantage. So far the company has pumped in Rs400 crore which includes Rs300 crore for the floor beam unit. "The new workshop is likely to have an investment of another Rs100 crore. Better air connectivity can add to the company's advantage as it will lead to faster movement of components, many of which have to be brought under controlled temperature," he said, adding, "It is hoped Mihan emerging as a cargo hub will lead to it." Dinesh Keskar, the president of Boeing India, said recent forecast on Indian aviation sector released by the company says that the country will need 1850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in the next 20 years. The purchase of Boeing 787s has also led to India add new routes. Gadkari urged Boeing to develop sea planes which he said can make transportation much easier. He recalled the time when the project was being wooed to Mihan and there were issues over allotment of land to TAL. "It was in 2007, and the site where TAL's unit stands now was a farm with a standing crop of soyabean. The owner was reluctant to leave but was finally convinced. A private businessman having invested in Mihan also gave him Rs20 lakh from his pocket," he said. Jai Vidarbha, says Keskar An emotional Dinesh Keskar ended his speech with Jai Vidarbha, Jai Maharashtra and Jai Hind. The president of Boeing India, who hails from Amravati, graduated in engineering at the erstwhile VRCE (now VNIT) in the city. After starting in English, Keskar ended his speech in Marathi. He said: "I could repay what Vidarbha my homeland gave me by bringing the Air India MRO and TAL to Nagpur. It was here that I got the opportunity to get educated enough to work in the US and achieve so much." Interestingly, the Jai Vidarbha comment came in the presence of CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The BJP, which fought the last elections on the plank of Vidarbha statehood, is today not making any move for its creation. Keskar's comment hardly raised any eyebrows at the venue. Nagpur as hub for aerospace biz CM Devendra Fadnavis said Nagpur is fast emerging as a hub for aerospace industry. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) is in advanced talks with one more company to set up an aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) depot in Mihan-SEZ. Later, sources said it was the Gurgaon-based Airworks which is likely take up 20 acres of land. "The Air India MRO built by Boeing is already functional, but initially business was not much. It was originally planned to be run by Boeing itself. But due to certain circumstances it was handed over to Air India. I had urged that Boeing should take it back. Though this could not happen so far, Dinesh Keskar has ensured that business goes up. Now Spice Jet will be getting its aircraft overhauled at the Air India MRO," said Fadnavis.

Home Latest Popular Pakistan Today's Paper Opinion World Sport Business Magazine Culture Blogs Tech Multimedia Archive In Depth SEARCH US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port AFP — Published Aug 20, 2016 01:48pm WHATSAPP   0 Comments  Email Email Your Name: Recipient Email:  Print This Nasa TV video grab shows US astronaut Kate Rubins viewed near the docking port on August 19, 2016 at the ISS. — AFP MIAMI: With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. Nasa describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft ─ the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 ─ to carry astronauts to the space station. Astronaut Kate Rubins adjusts cables on August 19, 2016 at the ISS. — AFP The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Early morning start With more private spaceship traffic expected at the ISS, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk to install a special parking spot for them. — AFP The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05am (1205 GMT) with veteran Nasa astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in Nasa's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers ─ also known as extravehicular (EV) crew ─ are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. This image provided by Nasa shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk. ─ Nasa via AP The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." Second spacewalk planned Nasa is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." Rubins works outside the International Space Station with the SpaceX Dragon space freighter just below her on August 19, 2016. — AFP However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. Nasa has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment ─ and it is not the same as what we do on the ground."

By Tom Mendelsohn August 20, 2016 16:59 BST Close Embed Feed SpaceX successfully launches a docking ring for space taxis for the International Space Station IBTimes US <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19326" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The International Space Station (ISS) is now equipped to host guests, after two astronauts finished a six-hour spacewalk to install a new docking bay for commercial traffic. Nasa is describing the new kit as "a metaphorical gateway to a future", while ISS's operations manager believes it is a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability". Two Americans currently stationed on the ISS, Jeff Williams and Kate Rubin, fitted the first of two docking adapters onto the orbital facility, which Nasa expects to see more and more use during the coming years. Describing the new adapter, which was designed by the aerospace company Boeing, as a "parking spot", Nasa's mission control announcer Rob Navias said: "We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles." Nasa claims that the docking equipment is the most sophisticated yet by allowing for automatic parking of spacecraft. Previous methods involved grappling and then berthing space ships in a clumsy process that has to be performed by the astronauts themselves. The new system will work with two upcoming private space vehicle projects: Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, with the first test flights expected as early as next year. Eventually, it will be the way astronauts and private citizens are brought to the ISS. Ever since Nasa retired the space shuttle in 2011, astronauts have had to arrive at the station using a Russian Soyuz rocket. Russia's Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, carrying its crew to the International Space Station (ISS), blasts off to the ISS from the launch pad at the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodromeVasily Maximov/ AFP SpaceX and Boeing are both developing a new generation of human-crewed spacecraft, which the two companies hope might enter official service by early 2018. The new docking adaptor has been made open source in the hopes that it will be adopted as a universal international standard. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," Nasa program manager Shaun Kelley told an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us."

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years. For example, after many failed attempts, companies are learning to reuse rockets in a cost-effective manner, as the Christian Science Monitor's Pete Spotts previously reported: NASA's space shuttle program was an initial attempt at developing a fleet of reusable vehicles for human spaceflight, as well as for launching and servicing satellites. But over its 30-year history, it never delivered on its architects’ initial promises.      Initial estimates suggested that each flight would cost as little as $9 million and the cost of carrying cargo would be $118 per pound. By the end of the program, each flight cost about $1.5 billion, and cargo cost about $10,000 per pound. Now, privately-owned aerospace companies owned by wealthy visionaries are taking up the challenge, free of Wall Street demands for quick returns on investment or of the intense scrutiny of annual federal budget cycles. As technology makes space exploration appear more practical, some also see the economic potential that Star Trek's iconic "final frontier" could offer to our already-mapped planet. Moon Express, an entrant in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, expresses the commercial aim of many companies seeking to explore the moon's natural resources to facilitate deeper space travel.  "We believe it's critical for humanity  to become a multi-world species and that our sister world, the Moon, is an eighth continent holding vast resources than can help us enrich and secure our future," writes Moon Express on the prize website.

Sanjai Currently, TAL is the only non-US facility to supply ACFBs to Boeing for its 787-9 Dreamliner, and it will also supply this component to the soon-to-be-built 787-10 Dreamliner. Mumbai: Tata Group-controlled TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd (TAL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors, has dispatched 5,000th Advanced Composite Floor Beam (ACFB) to plane maker Boeing Co. for its 787-9 and 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft. These ACFBs are shipped out of the aerospace manufacturing facility located in MIHAN SEZ, Nagpur. Currently, TAL is the only non-US facility to supply ACFBs to Boeing for its 787-9 Dreamliner, and it will also supply this component to the soon-to-be-built 787-10 Dreamliner. The ACFBs are shipped to Boeing partners in Italy, Japan and the US. “We are despatching the 5000th advanced composite floor beam for Boeing 787s-9s and Boeing 787-10. The 787-10 is yet to be manufactured. TAL was given the order for the first five 787-19 floor beams because of its reliable and impeccable delivery and quality performance,” Rajesh Khatri, executive director and chief executive officer, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd. TAL is six months ahead of its original schedule of despatch of floor beams. “We have invested over Rs.250 crore at the Boeing-dedicated facility in Nagpur. We started commercial production in March 2015,” he said. Khatri said TAL has a headcount of 880 in Pune and Nagpur, of which 550 are based in Nagpur. Boeing India President, Pratyush Kumar, called it a major milestone not just for Boeing and TAL, but also for India. TAL did not disclose the value of the contract. The Tata firm is associated with other original equipment manufacturers. “We are associated with the A (Airbus) and B (Boeing) of aircraft manufacturing,” Khatri said. TAL has signed a contract aerospace firm RUAG for supplying parts that will go into A320 planes made by Airbus SAS. The contract with RUAG is worth $170 million for making 550 sheet metal, machine parts and sub assemblies, which are fitted in to the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. “We are exclusive suppliers for these parts for RUAG,” Khatri said. TAL is also working on robots for commercial purpose. “We are working towards the formal commercial launch of robots, TAL BRABO!,” Khatri said. All three will help us to develop a sustainable and profitable business model enabling TAL to clock a five-fold increase in revenue of over Rs.1,000 crore from Rs.224 crore over the next five years, he said. He added that TAL would also increase headcount to 1,250 from its current 880. Aerospace is profitable and robotics will also turn profitable from next year, once commercial production starts, he said. “TAL is working with next generation aerospace technology with two leading airplane makers. We intend to be the market leader in civil aerospace manufacturing and among the top three aerospace manufacturers in India,” Khatri added. P.R.

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years.

Sitting on the tarmac at the Abbotsford Air Show, the F-35 stealth fighter made its first appearance in this country. Recently declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force — though critics point out much more work needs to be done on the jet — officials with its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, were jokingly referring to it by the name of the mythical beast, because it’s been talked about here so much and seen not at all. But the plane’s appearance in Abbotsford marked the first major shot in the next phase of the high-stakes marketing battle to sell a new fighter to the Canadian Forces. And the two main contenders in that battle — Boeing with its Super Hornet and Lockheed with the F-35 — came face-to-face in Abbotsford. “There’s no better vehicle to educate the public than to allow them to see the actual aircraft,” said Jack Crisler, one of Lockheed Martin’s top F-35 officials. “It’s here. It’s real.” The Liberal government is expected to decide within months how it wants to proceed on replacing Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. Justin Trudeau came to power last fall pledging that a Liberal government wouldn’t buy the F-35, an aircraft he said was too expensive and unnecessary given Canada’s needs. That should have been the kiss of death for Lockheed Martin. But Crisler said he’s feeling good these days about how Canada is moving ahead on the fighter jet file. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has talked about holding a fair and open competition. Lockheed Martin, along with other aircraft firms, recently submitted information to the government about their planes, and met Monday with federal officials. “It looks like we’re being included, so we look forward to competing on that basis,” Crisler said. “I’m certainly more optimistic than I was in December 2015.” The controversial stealth fighter became a political nightmare for the Harper government after it pledged to buy 65 of the planes, which were plagued by technology problems and complaints from U.S. lawmakers about their cost. Auditor General Michael Ferguson found that Canadian defence officials withheld key information from parliament about the proposed purchase, underestimated the costs of the jets and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. In June, Lockheed Martin almost saw its hopes of selling planes to Canada disappear completely. The Liberal government was close to moving on an interim purchase of Super Hornets and Trudeau claimed the F-35 “does not work and is far from working.” Related F-35, the aircraft Trudeau said is ‘far from working,’ now declared ready for combat by U.S. Air Force Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F-35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet U.S. Navy pilots report oxygen shortage while flying Super Hornet jets being considered by Liberals That prompted Lockheed Martin to warn that Canadian companies who had contracts on the F-35 would suffer. Plans for a Super Hornet interim deal seemed to disappear. As for Trudeau’s F-35 comment, Crisler has a diplomatic response: “The evidence is not consistent with a statement like that. If you’re not living it day-to-day, you might not see that.” At the Boeing tent at the Abbotsford air show, officials smiled while pointing out the F-35 wasn’t going to be showcased in a flight demonstration that weekend. In contrast, their Super Hornets roared back and forth in front of the crowds on both days of the show. “This is a remarkable event where we can show what our aircraft are capable of,” said top Boeing official Roberto Valla. A Boeing representative providing commentary for the demonstrations introduced the Super Hornet as a “fifth generation stealth fighter” — a dig at Lockheed, which also bills the F-35 as such. Boeing officials were happy to outline their sales pitch: their aircraft is combat proven, less expensive than the F-35 and will be operating with the U.S. military until at least 2040. During a demonstration in which a Postmedia reporter flew in one of the planes, Boeing pilot Ty Frautschi claimed the Super Hornet’s capabilities are suited to both combat and Arctic patrols; its two engines provide added safety for northern flights. The jet is designed to take the pounding from short landings on aircraft carriers, he said, which would also help it handle the short runways at the Canadian military’s forward operating locations in the Arctic. Both Lockheed and Boeing are promoting their longtime presence in Canada as part of their pitch. By September, Crisler said, Canadian firms will have been awarded US$1 billion worth of work on the F-35. For its part, in conjunction with the air show, Boeing announced the opening of a new software lab in Vancouver, including 50 new jobs. Crowds gathered to gawk and take photos of the planes, though the two F-35s didn’t fly. The U.S. Air Force pilots that flew them up from Utah were under strict rules not to discuss the Canadian situation. Instead, they chatted about the aircraft’s capabilities. F-35 pilot Lt.-Col. Curtis Pitts highlighted the plane’s powerful radar and sensors, and the stealth technology that provides it with increased survivability. If necessary, Pitts said, he’d be ready to go to war in the F-35 today. “It’s hard to find bad news” about the plane, said Pitts. “It’s all good news.” In the end, though, the Canadian Forces will have bad news for one of its suitors. dpugliese@postmedia.com Twitter.com/davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Main / Industry / Science, Technologies US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port 19 august, 15:17 0 International Space Station ©AFP / NASA With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them, AFP reports. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. - Early morning start - The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." - Second spacewalk planned - NASA is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground." 168 Tags: Americas, astronaut, equipment, International Space Station, ISS, news, space, USA Other news in the category "Science, Technologies": Google says anti-privacy effort has delivered $2 bn Fido forever?

A380: Ramping Down Production? Capt. Daniel Omale — Aug 20, 2016 4:10 am | Leave a comment This article is taken from Aviation week and Space Technology July 18-31, 2016. On Dec. 19, 2000, Jean-Luc Lagardere, co-chairman of the newly formed EADS, stood in front of a big crowd in Toulouse where he and his German colleague Manfred Bischoff had just announced the launch of the biggest commercial aircraft ever—the A380. “We will achieve superior profitability,” Lagardere confidently predicted. And Bischoff said with equal certainty: “There is a sufficient market” for the aircraft that would transform air transport much like the Boeing 747 did in the 1970s. At this year’s Farnborough Airshow, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier had the rather unpleasant task of amending these statements. The A380 is still decades away from recovering its development costs, in a best-case scenario. But whether it will reach that point became even more doubtful when Bregier conceded that—at least for now—the market is not nearly as big as the founders of EADS had hoped. EADS was later renamed Airbus Group. Because of the slow pace of orders for the A380, Airbus is severely curtailing production. The manufacturer is currently producing 2.5 aircraft per month. It turned out only 27 aircraft in 2015. The output will go down to 20 in 2017, and just one aircraft per month in 2018. Airbus’s $20 billion-plus bet at the turn of the century that it was going to break Boeing’s monopoly in the very large aircraft market is about to go terribly wrong. That decision is rapidly turning into a prime example of market misjudgment and bad timing. Instead of being the first aircraft in a new era of air travel, the A380 is now increasingly perceived as the last of an old era when big was beautiful. In some respects, the A380 is the victim of Airbus’s own success. Back in the old days, lower unit costs were mainly achievable by making aircraft larger. But since the introduction of the A380, major efficiency gains have been realized by engine manufacturers that enable airlines to operate smaller wide bodies such as the A350 and Boeing 787 at unit costs similar to those of the A380. Emirates Airline President Tim Clark says even the 777-300ER comes near the A380 in terms of cost per seat mile. But if there is no need to operate large aircraft to drive down costs, why take the risk of having more seats that one must sell on any given flight? Bregier, of course, thinks differently. He believes that general air traffic growth and constraints at key airports will require airlines to up gauge aircraft size regardless of the cost argument. “The trend is with us,” he said. The problem is that the argument may make sense in theory, but too few airlines are following it in reality. By ramping down A380 production, Airbus is giving the theory another 2-3 years to come to fruition while applying a tourniquet to the flow of red ink on the program. If orders still do not come in by then, the question will no longer be about how many aircraft are produced, but when production will end. More and more, observers are convinced that discontinuing the program is unavoidable. The rate cut “looks like the beginning of the end,” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia says. “I cannot imagine any market or technology changes that would cause sales to recover. The best they can do is to find a face-saving way to terminate the program.” Airbus has firm orders for 319 A380s, 193 of which had been delivered by the end of June. The backlog is 126, of which 61 are for Emirates Airline and can be considered a safe bet. However, the picture shifts when it comes to the remaining 65 aircraft. In fact, orders for around 40 aircraft look shaky. The backlog still includes orders for 20 aircraft from lessor Amedeo, which has not yet placed the aircraft with any operators; 10 aircraft originally planned for Hong Kong Airlines (and now listed for an undisclosed customer); six for Virgin Atlantic; and three for now-defunct Transaero. It appears to be highly unlikely that Hong Kong and Virgin will take delivery of their aircraft. A further two aircraft are listed for Air France, but the carrier has already made clear it does not intend to accept them. Most of the existing big operators such as Lufthansa, British Airways and Qatar Airways say they will not take more than their original orders. What is more, a preliminary commitment from Iran Air for 12 A380s announced in January does not appear to be turning into a firm deal. Bregier remains confident, at least officially. Airbus plans to keep A380 output at low levels “for a few years before we can ramp back up again,” he said at the Farnborough Airshow. He insisted that he sees “big upside potential” in the program in spite of the announced scaling back. Bregier sees two reasons why production could be boosted again at some point. He argues that Emirates will eventually have to replace its existing fleet, which will grow to 142 aircraft in the next few years. After all, Clark has often made clear that the carrier would want to replace the aircraft with the A380 again, ideally with an A380neo, and that an order for up to 200 aircraft is possible. But the fact that the A380neo proposal has been shelved for several years is further evidence that Airbus’s confidence in sales prospects for its flagship aircraft is dwindling. Projecting such optimism for 25 years later is a further indicator of Airbus’s misjudgment. The much more short-term challenge is to keep program costs under control. Bregier says Airbus knows it can profitably build 20 A380s in 2017, down from the current level of 27. He indirectly concedes going to 12 will not be profitable: “I don’t say we will break even at 12.” On the other hand, he emphasizes that the losses incurred at that low production rate “will not be material for Airbus.” However dramatic the A380 crisis may look, it is unique. The rest of the industry (and the Airbus portfolio) are nowhere near crisis mode.

If the sightings by multiple witnesses in the early morning hours of March 8, 2014 — the day the Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 passengers and crew cut off all communication and vanished — were authentic after all, the final location of Flight MH370, as well as the prevailing theory as to why the plane went missing in the first place, would need to be completely reevaluated. #MH370: Malaysia’s DCA confirms receiving debris from Madagascar found by m Blaine Gibson as we reported yesterday pic.twitter.com/zhdmOEiQe8 — Sumisha Naidu (@SumishaCNA) July 20, 2016 Gibson, a lawyer turned world traveler from Seattle, Washington, discovered several pieces of aircraft debris on beaches in Mozambique and Mauritius, in the western Indian Ocean off the coast of southeast Africa, earlier this year. The debris, authorities have determined, is “highly likely” to have come from Flight MH370. #MH370 MOT Release: Summary of possible MH370 debris recovered (15 Aug 2016) https://t.co/rIdu26I5cy pic.twitter.com/M2u1eFm2Fl — WLP (@Bookofresearch) August 18, 2016 The independent researcher — who describes his private investigation into the Malaysia Airlines disappearance as a “quest” — has now teamed up with South Africa teenager Liam Lotter, who also found a piece of debris believed to be from the plane, to continue the hunt for further wreckage. Gibson and Lotter explain their search in the following video interview, conducted by South Africa’s East Coast Radio earlier this week. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcHG-RvHnZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Maldives is a country of just over 390,000 inhabitants spread over nearly 1,200 small islands in the northern Indian Ocean, about 550 miles southwest of Colombo, Sri Lanka. At about 6:15 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014 (9:15 p.m. the previous night United States Eastern Time), several residents of the Kuda Huvadhoo, an island in the southern reach of the Maldives archipelago, reported sighting a large aircraft flying at low altitude with a deafening noise, zooming from the northwest over the island. Officials looked into the sighting, but dismissed the residents’ accounts, saying they had either seen a regularly scheduled, propeller-powered tourist plane, a private jet, or nothing at all. “The Maldives government first claimed there was ‘no plane,’ then the plane was a ‘private jet.’ then fifteen months later a ‘domestic propeller plane flight,’ then back to ‘no plane,’ then finally to say it cannot be discussed due to ‘national security,” Blaine Gibson wrote in an August 12, 2016 report posted online (see link below). “And previously reputable international media have been readily willing to mop up and regurgitate each of those evolving claims.” The official search team, led by the governments of Australia and Malaysia, also “debunked” the witness accounts as inconsistent with satellite “ping” data that appeared to show the rogue Malaysia Airlines on a course from the east, headed toward Antarctica and terminating in the ocean waters approximately 1,200 miles off the coast of western Australia. That location would be roughly 3,000 miles by air from the sightings in Maldives — too far for Flight MH370 to make it without running out of fuel. In fact, according to the August 12 Blaine Gibson report, the Malaysia Airlines plane would have been “nearing fuel exhaustion” by the time it reached Maldives — meaning that if the sightings there are authentic, the wreckage of the plane lies hundreds, even thousands of miles north of the current, official search site.

And even more startling, the witnesses say they saw the Boeing 777 take a hard turn to the south — which would indicate that someone, whether the pilot, a hijacker or another person, was at the controls. Gibson as well as the official investigators have previously held to the belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane was a “ghost flight,” operating on automatic pilot after the passengers and crew were incapacitated by some on-board calamity, such as a fire or rapid, accidental cabin decompression.

Blaine Gibson wrote that he investigated claims of a propeller plane, or private jet, and found no evidence that either type of flight was anywhere over Maldives on March 8, 2014, a finding that coupled with descriptions offered by multiple witnesses led him to believe that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may indeed — for some mysterious reason — have made a low-altitude pass over Maldives that morning.

The step was considered to be quite crucial for NASA to regain an independent access to the lab complex since 2011 when the shuttle fleet was retired. The International Docking Adapter (IDA) has been built by Boeing that will help spacecraft from both the organizations to bring crews to the outpost. With this, NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships will come to an end. In 2018, the second IDA would most probably be attached. Station commander Jeff Williams and astronaut Kate Rubins have attached and outfitted the IDA. Williams was of the view, “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles. Congratulations to the entire team”. The spacewalk started at 8.04am EDT. The IDA reached the ISS aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. On Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and placed it at a spot where it would be easier for the spacewalkers to install it. Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi was involved in the mission though he did not perform the spacewalk. He was working inside the station and once sensors indicated that the IDA has been properly aligned, he asked the astronauts to firmly lock down the IDA. The astronauts have installed new laser reflectors that would be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to determine distance and relative velocity. NASA has planned to install the IDA last year, but it was postponed because the initial unit being carried by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket met a catastrophic failure.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Betting on aero biz, TAL Manufacturing eyes Rs 1k cr turnover Press Trust of India | New Delhi Aug 21, 2016 10:57 AM IST Tata Motors arm TAL Manufacturing Solutions is betting big on its aerospace business as it eyes a five-fold increase in turnover to Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years, for which it will invest Rs 100 crore to augment its manufacturing capacity. The company expects its aerospace vertical, with supplies players such as Boeing and RUAG Group - a tier I parts supplier for Airbus - to contribute up to 70 per cent of its turnover by 2021 while the rest would come from robotics and other allied businesses. TAL has already started selling from July this year its industrial articulated robot BRABO priced between Rs 4-10 lakh as it looks to tap the opportunity in small and medium enterprises sector in India by offering cost effective solutions. "Today, our revenue is around Rs 220 crore. We are looking at five-times growth in our revenue in the next five years," TAL Manufacturing Solutions Executive Director and CEO Rajesh Khatri told PTI. Sharing the break-up of the target, he said the aerospace vertical is likely to account for Rs 650-700 crore and the rest would come from robotics and allied business in automotive and heavy engineering. When asked about investments to meet the target, Khatri said the company plans to invest about Rs 100 crore in the next two to three years for setting up a third unit for composites and large assemblies. TAL already has a unit dedicated for supplies to Boeing and another one to meet its commitments to the RUAG Group at its Nagpur facility. In terms of employment, Khatri said the company could increase the headcount to 1,200-1,250 by 2021 from the current 880. The company had last week shipped the 5,000th advanced composite floor beam assemblies for Boeing 787-Dreamliner. It had started supplies to the US aerospace major from its Nagpur facility in October 2014. Khatri said the company is also looking for "several new packages" in the aerospace segment as it looks to expand portfolio. These could include fuselage parts, sheet metals and composites. On the robotics segment, he said: "From the end of July this year we have started selling our robot. We intend to offer cost effective solutions with strong value proposition to small and medium enterprises in India which need automation but don't have that big capital to invest on it.

User menu Authors Privacy Policy Contact Login PerfScience Home Biology Climate Energy Physics Geology Health Paleontology Space Newly installed docking port means ISS could accommodate different space taxis Submitted by Luis Georg on Sat, 08/20/2016 - 15:51 A key step towards having new commercial space taxis that arrive at the International Space Station (ISS) has been taken with successful installation of a new docking port to the ISS on Friday. Two NASA astronauts have installed the International Docking Adapter (IDA). Jeff Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and flight engineer Kate Rubins started the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT to accomplish the task. Due to minor communication problem, the spacewalk came to an early end at 2.02pm EDT. Before the spacewalk was carried out, the ground robotics team using the ISS’s robotic arm Dextre positioned the IDA in front of the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2) so it becomes convenient for the astronauts to install it. Installation of the IDA means that the ISS will be able to accommodate different space taxis, including SpaceX and Boeing vehicles. Before this, only Russian vehicles were able to dock with the ISS. Williams said, “We've opened up a new chapter [of] the story of the International Space Station. Congratulations to the entire team”. In addition, Williams and Rubins also clicked photos of the new docking port and routed additional cables for a second IDA. As mentioned above about the communication problem which happened with Williams' right ear piece, these additional minor tasks were called off. Both the astronauts moved back to the ISS’s airlock around 1.30 EDT and by 2.02 EDT, both of them were safely inside the ISS. This was Williams fourth spacewalk and first for Rubins. If SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying an initial unit would not have met a catastrophic failure then there is a possibility that NASA has installed the first IDA last year only. Now, the second would be installed in 2018. According to a story published on the topic by Reuters News, "Two NASA astronauts completed a six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Friday to install a parking spot for upcoming commercial space taxis, which will end U.S. reliance on Russia for rides to the orbiting outpost. Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed." California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit,” Hill said, speaking on a panel of NASA staff assembled to discuss the upcoming Mars mission. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, so that research can continue in low-earth orbit," according to a recent Tech Crunch report. The timing fits with the end of The U.S. Government’s current funding of the ISS program, which was extended by President Obama’s administration from its original deorbiting date of 2016 through 2020. Operations were prolonged through 2024 to help give NASA a platform from which to run its near-Earth preparatory missions leading up to the ultimate manned mission to Mars. A report published in News Ledge informed, "NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are conducting one of the most vital spacewalks for the future of the International Space Station. The pair switched their spacesuits to battery power at 8:04 am ET and began a more than six-hour spacewalk. Their mission? To install the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). Without these adapters, manned missions from Boeing and SpaceX are a no go." Getting the first IDA to the ISS took a bit longer than expected. The first one was originally launched to the ISS back by SpaceX in June 2015. But that mission failed when the launch vehicle disintegrated about two minutes after launch. Work for today’s spacewalk began on Wednesday when ground controllers used the robotic arm to snatch the IDA from the Dragon spacecraft and place it 2 feet away from the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA).

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in US efforts to create a marketplace in space. Nasa posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach Nasa to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” Nasa also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavours 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” Nasa spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, Nasa stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. Nasa received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS programme, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc, which has a Nasa contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr, president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former Nasa astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support Nasa’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion (Dh4.40 billion) deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since Nasa agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, US-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable Nasa to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to Nasa might be how to minimise the harmful effects of space on the human body” — from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure” — as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, president Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analogue to this type of exercise is the ‘CubeSat’ initiative, in which Nasa allows schools and non-profit organisations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving Nasa access to the research.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Later this year, tech entrepreneur turned space pioneer Elon Musk is planning the blastoff of a new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, that would be twice as powerful as any other in use and one of the biggest since the Apollo era’s mighty Saturn V. The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969.  Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.35 -0.77 -1.26% Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.59 +0.07 +0.04% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 779.56 -5.77 -0.73% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▼ 484.10 -2.55 -0.52% SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” © Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images With SpaceX, Elon Musk aspires to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. Space is not orbit Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ ” Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors.© Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets — at $250,000 each — to ride on his spacecraft. Dreams are born It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.”© NASA/NASA via Getty Images Landed SpaceX rockets sit in Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Commercial milestone The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. “We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered,” he said in an interview late last year. “And we’d love to see whether we’re correct about that.” Innovation revolution To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, “holds similar revolutionary potential.” He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground — including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. “When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine,” Allen said. “That’s the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts.” For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand — especially if they’re successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building “the highway to lower orbit” so that the next generation “will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space.” His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned “residential and light industrial,” he said. Musk is focused on Mars. “It’s fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can’t get there. You need to build the Union Pacific,” he said. “Once there’s a transportation link established to Mars, it’ll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don’t even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars.” That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos’s rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars.

It’s a brave – or perhaps desperate – company that’s willing to challenge French workers’ assumption that they get to spend a month en vacances but now Airbus, one of the country’s most high-profile businesses, is taking a stand.  Rather than simply bid bon voyage to its staff at the start of August, the pan-European plane-maker has offered overtime to workers at its Toulouse base as it battles to get production of its new A350XWB airliner on track. An A350 rolls out of the production centre in Toulouse Credit: Airbus The company has set itself a target of producing 50 of its twin-engine jets and is offering additional work to the 1,500 staff on the A350 production line as it hopes to take on rival Boeing’s similar sized 787 airliner, which came into service two years earlier. Hitting production targets on the A350, which seats 270 to 370 passengers and starts at $270m (£207m) for the smallest model, is crucial for Airbus after the programme ran into serious delays earlier this year. Work fell behind after suppliers of cabin fittings and toilets let Airbus down. Chief executive Fabrice Bregier singled out subcontractor Zodiac as a major cause of delays, using Airbus’s annual conference to publicly shame the company over its performance and saying it had been dropped as a supplier to another of company’s jets. Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier has blamed suppliers for delays with the A350 programme Credit: Bloomberg Aviation experts are eagerly watching output of the A350, with Airbus’s own figures showing it delivered 15 in the year to the end of July, with unofficial sources saying another three had since rolled out of the Toulouse plant. This means the company will have to significantly accelerate production rates to meet its target and avoid penalties for missing delivery slots. “Airbus has made commitments to airlines and is pulling out all the stops so it doesn’t face late delivery costs,” said Howard Wheeldon, an independent aviation analyst. “Yes, overtime is an additional cost but it’s probably cheaper than delivering a plane late.”  Saj Ahmad, analyst at Strategic Aero Research, added: “That Airbus is breaking its own norms by working through August points to desperation to get the A350 on track. There’s only so much blame it can peddle to suppliers – if they were the true pacing item, then why bother building aeroplanes through the summer that could be missing parts? “It would be a disaster for Airbus to miss its 50-aircraft target. The costs of the A350 programme aren’t coming down and delayed deliveries mean airlines seek compensation, so it’s a doubly whammy.”  Mr Ahmad added that if Airbus misses deliveries it could also drive customers to rival Boeing, which is increasing the rate at which it produces competitors to the A350.  A spokesman for Airbus said: “We have set up a timetable adaptation plan for employees at the A350 final assembly line in Toulouse in order to maintain sufficient resources during the summer season and to support the manufacturing flow. This plan involves the introduction of overtime.” Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Airbus airline industry Boeing Show more Business latest 01:35 23 Nov 2016, 7:43pm Autumn Statement 2016: Hammond's Speech unspun Premium 23 Nov 2016, 7:17pm Market report: Gold skids to nine-month low as dollar extends gains 23 Nov 2016, 7:07pm No relief for soaring business rates burden 00:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:56pm Britain’s debt mountain set to hit £2 trillion in the 2020s  23 Nov 2016, 6:46pm Thirteen things you need to know about the Autumn Statement  01:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:20pm Autumn Statement: Eurosceptic MPs accuses OBR of anti-Brexit forecasts as it says leaving EU will cost £60bn  23 Nov 2016, 6:18pm Comment: Hammond's fiscal blunder almost guarantees a hard-landing Ambrose Evans-Pritchard Premium 23 Nov 2016, 5:09pm Spring Statement and autumn Budget ahead as Hammond shakes up the fiscal calendar 23 Nov 2016, 4:22pm Autumn Statement 2016 calculator:  work out how your finances have changed 23 Nov 2016, 3:40pm Autumn Statement 2016: Five charts which show the state of the UK economy Premium 01:21 23 Nov 2016, 3:15pm When is Black Friday 2016 and who has the best deals? 23 Nov 2016, 2:47pm How the internet reacted to the Autumn Statement: The best tweets   23 Nov 2016, 2:43pm Phillip Hammond pledges to tackle the UK's productivity gap 23 Nov 2016, 2:37pm Comment: Phillip Hammond the cautious Chancellor failed to make any truly bold decisions Ben Wright Premium 51:36 23 Nov 2016, 1:39pm Autumn Statement 2016: The Chancellor's speech in full 01:32 23 Nov 2016, 1:38pm Autumn Statement 2016 summary and highlights: Everything you need to know 23 Nov 2016, 12:43pm Severn Trent outbid for Dee Valley Water amid jobs row 23 Nov 2016, 12:30pm House building contracts surge as industry shakes off post-referendum lull 23 Nov 2016, 12:18pm Hammerson expands European presence with outlet portfolio buy 23 Nov 2016, 11:58am 'Door is open' for Sir Philip Green to save the BHS pension scheme, watchdog says 23 Nov 2016, 11:44am Rio Tinto to sell Scottish aluminium smelter to Liberty for £330m If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

The stage for the rocket's debut: the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX's use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government's monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph - over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all - making space travel routine - in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.     ▲ Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos says commercial space exploration can advance at the fast pace of Internet commerce only if the cost is reduced through advances in reusable rockets. Bloomberg photo While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended "learning period" that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. "When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs - whether it's a year from now or five years from now," she said, "the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?" Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they've apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there's something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That's what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos's Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket "the rarest of beasts." "Not quite 'rarest,' " Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult - landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: "Welcome to the club!" Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos's Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into "space," a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth's surface. But Musk's SpaceX spacecraft don't just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast - about five miles per second - that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch "Star Wars." Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor - "like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall," Musk said. Orbit and space "are different leagues," Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea - a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it.     ▲ Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson's goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets - at $250,000 each - to ride on his spacecraft. Washington Post photo by Ricky Carioti. The Washington Post And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a "phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that." Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn't have one qualified to carry people. "If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA's human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs," Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, "Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct." At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. "It was a seminal moment for me," he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. "A magic sculpture garden," he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency's website for its Mars plan but could not find one. "Because, of course, there had to be a schedule," he said in a 2012 speech. "And I couldn't find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn't on the website at all. Which was shocking." Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. "We're sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this," Musk said, "while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies." As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. "Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up," he wrote in his memoir. "For sheer adventure, you couldn't beat outer space." In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he's back. He's building Stratolaunch, that would become the world's largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and "air-launch" into orbit.     ▲ Paul G. Allen teamed with aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which was the first commercial vehicle to reach space in 2004. Now he's building Stratolaunch, the world's largest airplane. Vulcan Branson's goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he's proud that more than 700 people - more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space - have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. "Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore," Branson's Virgin Galactic says on its website. "But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet's seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves." The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world's first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. "We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered," he said in an interview late last year. "And we'd love to see whether we're correct about that." To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, "holds similar revolutionary potential." He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground - including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. "When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine," Allen said. "That's the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts." For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA's human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry "is on the crest of another wave." "There's a lot of hype," he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. "But will we be able to generate enough demand?" he said. "It can't just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?" Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand - especially if they're successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building "the highway to lower orbit" so that the next generation "will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space." His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned "residential and light industrial," he said.     ▲ SpaceX and Blue Origin both land their rocket boosters vertically, but the Falcon9's booster travels higher and much farther before it lands on a platform in the ocean. The Washington Post Musk is focused on Mars. "It's fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can't get there. You need to build the Union Pacific," he said. "Once there's a transportation link established to Mars, it'll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don't even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars." That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, "because it is hard" pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos's rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 기사 수정 :   2016-08-21 00:35   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2016-08-21 00:33   관리자 입력.편집 :   2016-08-21 00:30   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 비난 댓글 가득한 손연재 인스타그램 김기춘 "최순실 개입 몰라 자괴감…중정때 최태민 조사안해" '갤럭시노트7을 구하라' 김의성이 이승환을 "친구"라 불렀더니 생긴 일 벤츠 코리아 '더 뉴 E 200 아방가르드' 출시 비난 댓글 가득한 손연재 인스타그램 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” ——— Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html     Tags: space, williams, shuttle, spacewalk, launch, flight, Other stories from today: Syria’s first responders: ‘Most dangerous job in the world’ Democrat Hernandez won’t campaign for congressional seat Spacewalking astronauts install new door for visitors     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   For what are you most thankful?

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:13AM Washington is getting ready to deliver a big load of cash to Israel. Image source: Getty Images. If I told you Washington is gearing up to deliver a big load of cash to Israel, to pay for military purchases, would that surprise you? If you've been keeping up with the news, probably not. But here's something that may surprise you: Much of the money America is planning to "give" to Israel as military aid is actually making a U-turn -- and coming right back into the pockets of U.S. defense contractors Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN). The news Last month, the Obama administration asked Congress to increase the level of annual U.S. military aid to Israel from its current level -- about $3 billion a year -- to as much as $40 billion over 10 years. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget calls the new aid package, which is still under discussion, "the largest pledge of military assistance to any country in U.S. history." Historically, the U.S. has awarded military aid to client states on the condition that the funds awarded be spent on military equipment manufactured by U.S. suppliers. Israel, however, has been granted a unique exemption, allowing it to spend as much as 25% of its military aid on purchases from non-U.S. suppliers. Israel generally takes advantage of this exemption by using U.S. aid to buy weapons from Israeli manufacturers, helping to build up its own arms industry -- an industry that has, over the past few decades, developed into a competitor to U.S. companies. If the U.S. raises the amount of defense aid to the level Israel is seeking, one condition may be that Israel spends more of its military aid dollars here in the U.S. Spend...on what? Israel's military wish list reportedly includes F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin and armored personnel carriers built with help from General Dynamics. But there's perhaps even greater interest in getting funds to pay for Israel's multiple missile defense initiatives: Iron Dome -- short-range missile defense against rockets and artillery shells. Arrow -- a hypersonic "theater" level defense system against ballistic missiles up to 150 km distant. David's Sling -- a two-stage system for shooting down tactical ballistic missiles, medium- to long-range rockets, and cruise missiles at distances up to 300 km. Israel also has an ultra-short-range Iron Dome derivative project under works. Dubbed "Iron Beam," it would use high-energy laser weapons to shoot down short-range rockets, artillery, and mortars too small to be effectively targeted by an anti-missile missile. And there's an Arrow derivative ("Arrow 3") that's being developed as a potential anti-satellite weapons. What it means to investors So, what does additional funding for Israeli missile defense mean for Boeing and Raytheon? Quite a lot, actually. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, about 9% of all U.S. funding for our own Missile Defense Agency is spent on Israeli missile defense programs. In particular, DefenseNews.com reports that the current U.S. 2017 defense budget contains $200 million in funding for development of Israel Aerospace Industries' Arrow missile defense systems. Boeing partners 50-50 with IAI on that project, so 50% of funding for Arrow must be spent buying equipment from Boeing. Similarly, Raytheon -- which partners 50-50 with Israel's Rafael on the Iron Dome and David's Sling missile defense systems -- stands to reap about $75 million in revenue this year from U.S. support of these two systems. To be clear, this is what the two defense contractors could receive from fiscal year 2017 funding alone -- and 2017 isn't even an especially "good" year in this regard. In 2014, for example, one single contract (to supply Israel with replacement interceptor missiles for the Iron Dome system) netted Raytheon nearly $150 million. Over the course of a new 10-year agreement including $40 billion (or even just $30 billion) in U.S. funding, the revenue opportunities for these companies will be even greater.

This is according to US adventurer and modern day Indiana Jones, Blaine Gibson, who has been investigating the disappearance. Gibson arrived in Durban on Friday to team up with Liam Lotter from KwaZulu-Natal, and Neels Kruger from Pretoria, who discovered debris confirmed to be from the missing Boeing 777. The flight was en route to Beijing when it disappeared. Lotter found debris on a Mozambique beach during the December holidays which was sent for analysis, and Neels Kruger found another piece on a Mossel Bay beach. Gibson also found debris on a sandbar off the Mozambique coast. Describing himself as “a lawyer who loves adventures and solving mysteries”, he confirmed he had spent many months searching for clues. He has also been to Madagascar where he found more debris believed to be from the missing plane. “An Ausralian oceanographer, who is doing the drift analysis, told me that the two most likely places debris from the plane would be found would be on the eastern coast of Madagascar and the eastern coast of South Africa, particularly Durban,” said Gibson. Gibson made contact with the two South Africans following their separate pieces of debris being confirmed as from the ill-fated flight. The three will travel to Port Shepstone tomorrow to begin a further search. Lotter, who is hosting Gibson at his home in Wartburg, said they would be walking along beaches from Port Shepstone up the coast to Durban. Kruger was already on the South Coast. Lotter and Gibson visited beaches in uMhlanga on Friday and Gibson said he did not believe that the Boeing had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean as has been speculated. ”I found three or four pieces of debris from the main cabin in Madagascar in June. Debris will not only tell us where the plane crashed, but also why. “I do not believe it could have been a controlled landing pilot suicide as has been speculated, but rather a high impact crash. Although I prefer to stay away from any theory. There are too many theories and not enough evidence,” said Gibson. He asked beachgoers to keep an eye out for any pieces of debris from the plane or even personal items, which could have washed ashore. “Pieces of the plane would be light grey or white and could look as though they are from a boat, surfboard or even a box,” said Gibson. Disappearance He added that he had gone to the first commemoration of the disappearance and had met many of the victims’ families. Lotter said he had become caught up in the search for the missing plane since finding his piece of debris and also asked that Durbanites keep their eyes open for any evidence that may have washed up on the beach. “A small piece of debris on the beach might not mean anything to you, but it could mean everything to one of the family members of the missing passengers,” said Lotter. Kruger said he realised that the possibility of finding another piece of the plane was a “needle in a haystack situation”, but that sharing their experiences with one another carried great value. “Sharing this with those who cross our paths would also help in future search efforts,” he said. Meanwhile, air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps, fitted with satellite trackers, into the Indian Ocean in a last ditch effort to try to locate the elusive wreckage. An estimated 74 030km2 have been searched during the two-year operation to find the missing aircraft. In July, Malaysia, China and Australia agreed that the exhaustive hunt would be suspended once the current search of the south west portion of the Indian Ocean (from Australia) is completed. The hunt has cost in the region of $160-million (R2.1-billion).

The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsized ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ “ Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.” The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. “We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered,” he said in an interview late last year. “And we’d love to see whether we’re correct about that.” To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, “holds similar revolutionary potential.” He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground — including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. “When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine,” Allen said. “That’s the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts.” For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand — especially if they’re successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building “the highway to lower orbit” so that the next generation “will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space.” His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned “residential and light industrial,” he said. Musk is focused on Mars. “It’s fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can’t get there. You need to build the Union Pacific,” he said. “Once there’s a transportation link established to Mars, it’ll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don’t even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars.” That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos’s rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars.

AP This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port. AP By MARCIA DUNN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port – their major objective – in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half-hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now-obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides – at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 31/2-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one – cobbled together from spare parts – should arrive in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position – the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights – intended to go all the way to the space station and dock – will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Teen in coma after getting hit by metal object through car's windshield on 57 freeway Police officer, wife die in possible murder-suicide in Long Beach Gas station employee stabbed in Anaheim, two suspects in custody Congressman Issa declares re-election win in 49th district Judge denies Muslim women's request to drop trespassing claim in Urth Caffe lawsuit User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Picture: Zanele Zulu Durban - Durban beaches could hold vital clues in the mystery of the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight which disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board, shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur in March 2014. This is according to US adventurer and modern day Indiana Jones, Blaine Gibson, who has been investigating the disappearance. Gibson arrived in Durban on Friday to team up with Liam Lotter from KwaZulu-Natal, and Neels Kruger from Pretoria, who discovered debris confirmed to be from the missing Boeing 777. The flight was en route to Beijing when it disappeared. Lotter found debris on a Mozambique beach during the December holidays which was sent for analysis, and Neels Kruger found another piece on a Mossel Bay beach. Gibson also found debris on a sandbar off the Mozambique coast. Describing himself as “a lawyer who loves adventures and solving mysteries”, he confirmed he had spent many months searching for clues. He has also been to Madagascar where he found more debris believed to be from the missing plane. “An Ausralian oceanographer, who is doing the drift analysis, told me that the two most likely places debris from the plane would be found would be on the eastern coast of Madagascar and the eastern coast of South Africa, particularly Durban,” said Gibson. Gibson made contact with the two South Africans following their separate pieces of debris being confirmed as from the ill-fated flight. The three will travel to Port Shepstone tomorrow to begin a further search. Lotter, who is hosting Gibson at his home in Wartburg, said they would be walking along beaches from Port Shepstone up the coast to Durban. Kruger was already on the South Coast. Lotter and Gibson visited beaches in uMhlanga on Friday and Gibson said he did not believe that the Boeing had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean as has been speculated. ”I found three or four pieces of debris from the main cabin in Madagascar in June. Debris will not only tell us where the plane crashed, but also why. “I do not believe it could have been a controlled landing pilot suicide as has been speculated, but rather a high impact crash. Although I prefer to stay away from any theory. There are too many theories and not enough evidence,” said Gibson. He asked beachgoers to keep an eye out for any pieces of debris from the plane or even personal items, which could have washed ashore. “Pieces of the plane would be light grey or white and could look as though they are from a boat, surfboard or even a box,” said Gibson. Disappearance He added that he had gone to the first commemoration of the disappearance and had met many of the victims’ families. Lotter said he had become caught up in the search for the missing plane since finding his piece of debris and also asked that Durbanites keep their eyes open for any evidence that may have washed up on the beach. “A small piece of debris on the beach might not mean anything to you, but it could mean everything to one of the family members of the missing passengers,” said Lotter. Kruger said he realised that the possibility of finding another piece of the plane was a “needle in a haystack situation”, but that sharing their experiences with one another carried great value. “Sharing this with those who cross our paths would also help in future search efforts,” he said. Meanwhile, air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps, fitted with satellite trackers, into the Indian Ocean in a last ditch effort to try to locate the elusive wreckage. An estimated 74 030km2 have been searched during the two-year operation to find the missing aircraft. In July, Malaysia, China and Australia agreed that the exhaustive hunt would be suspended once the current search of the south west portion of the Indian Ocean (from Australia) is completed. The hunt has cost in the region of $160-million (R2.1-billion).

Nasa is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in US efforts to create a marketplace in space. Nasa posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues”. “Commercial companies continue to approach Nasa to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability”. Nasa also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavours 400km above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” Nasa spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, Nasa stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. Nasa received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies”, Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS programme, said in an email.  Orbital ATK Inc, which has a Nasa contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. Can Nasa and China work together in space? One small step towards ending the ban on scientific collaboration The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jnr, president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former Nasa astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science Rob Meyerson , Blue Origin “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test-bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support Nasa’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, US$1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since Nasa agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. 11 reasons to be excited about the future of technology On Friday, two ISS crew members installed a new docking port to allow for planned, US-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable Nasa to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins floated outside the orbiting laboratory for a spacewalk lasting five hours and 58 minutes to attach the first of two international docking adaptors. The astronauts spent more than two hours tying down the adaptor, after which robotic machinery at the space station completed the hard mate, making the attachment permanent. “With that, we have a new port of call,” Nasa commentator Rob Navias said as the space station flew over Singapore at 10.40am. During the rest of the spacewalk, astronauts connected power and data cables for the adaptor. The fittings will enable the space station to share power and data with visiting spaceships. One research area of deep interest to Nasa might be how to minimise the harmful effects of space on the human body – from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure – as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative , in which Nasa allows schools and non-profit organisations to conduct research in space. These nano-satellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving Nasa access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins on Friday floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Ms Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $US70 million ($A91 million) per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Mr Williams and Ms Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $US100 billion ($A130 billion) research laboratory that flies about 400 km above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Mr Williams and Ms Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Mr Williams' spacesuit, Mr Navias said. Mr Williams and Ms Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame.

Davis Beach to eliminate racing 7 Months Ago New black museum prepared to deal with visitors' emotions (w/video) 2 Months Ago The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-by-5-feet-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the southwestern U.S., possibly New Mexico.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry.

This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era.

Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” More Nation Snow blankets parts of Northeast Trump taps SC Gov Haley and charter school backer DeVos Trump shifts on Clinton prosecution, climate change Trump Foundation apparently admits to violating IRS ban on 'self-dealing' Obama awards Medal of Freedom to 21 Subscribe today!

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (no reporter narration) STORY: An unmanned Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Wednesday to put a mostly classified experimental space plane into orbit for the U.S. military. The 206-foot (63-meter) tall rocket, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, soared off its seaside launch pad at 11:05 a.m. EDT (1505 GMT) to deliver an X-37B drone ship into orbit for a fourth mission. As with previous flights, the U.S. Air Force would not say what the space plane, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, will be doing in orbit or how long it will stay there. After the X-37B is released into orbit, its upper-stage engine also will deploy 10 tiny satellites, called CubeSats. One spacecraft is a crowd-funded technology effort called LightSail to develop a propulsion system that uses the pressure of photons from the sun, a technique known as solar sailing, rather than chemical propellants.

Makona told a parliamentary committee on transport and infrastructure development that management and the board had crafted a four year recovery plan for the airline, which forecast a $7 million loss for the full-year to December despite a modest growth in the global aviation industry. The company has projected $148 million in revenue against total expenditure of $155 million in 2015. Under the proposed three-phased plan, which is yet to receive government approval, management will initiate measures that will arrest the current loss-making position before break-even and profitability. Air Zimbabwe, Makona said is currently saddled with a $298 million debt and wants government to expunge the liability. Of the debt, $272 million is local. “Honourable members, this team would be lying under oath to say that Air Zimbabwe can be turned around overnight. With the current set up of $298 million debt, it is not possible to come up overnight in a turnaround process and find ourselves in a profitable situation,” said Makona. “The economic life of our aircraft is 20 years, beyond 20 years, they are saying no matter how much you strive, you will be operating but you may not be making a profit. At 20 years our Boeing aircraft, the two types, are beyond 20 years. In terms of safety, the lifespan is 75,000 cycles, which is given in terms of landings and take-offs. At the moment, our most utilised aircraft, which is the Boeing 737 is nearing 40,000 cycles. So our aircraft in terms of utilisation, have always been underutilised. In terms of safety, they are still safe.” Global airlines are this year expected to post an aggregate net profit $25 billion from $19,9 billion reported in 2014. The airline’s general manager in charge of finance and support services, Pagiel Chimudzi said the airline is technically insolvent and requires fresh capital to turn around its fortunes. “The airline is actually insolvent, if it was a private company with no government involvement the directors would need to be prosecuted for reckless trade. This is the reality,” he said. “Maybe people have not been saying it clearly so I am going to say it clearly that what is needed from the shareholder is to put in money to pay off creditors because we owe them. Further to that, there is need to put in money to recapitalize the business.  But right now we have a situation where (the shareholder has) not put in the resources.” He compared Air Zimbabwe to “a patient who is in dire need of fluids otherwise they die of dehydration.” At the moment, the airline was getting government support on an adhoc basis, he added. Chimudzi said the Air Zimbabwe should also change its model to cater for the low end market in the face of new entrants on the domestic market. Makona said the airline is currently flying three out of its fleet of 10 aircraft and hopes to have two that are currently being serviced in neighboring South Africa by month-end. The airline also wants to reintroduce domestic flights to Buffalo Range to widen its revenue inflows. The funds, the company said would also help in acquiring two turbo prop aircraft. Last December, Makona said he expected total passenger traffic to double to 365,000 this year on increased tourists. Government has said it expects foreign arrivals to rise to 3,2 million this year from 2,5 million last year.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station’s airlock and headed towards the berthing slip once used by Nasa’s now-retired space shuttles, a Nasa TV broadcast showed. “Great view,” said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. During Friday’s spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle’s docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. “It’s a gateway to a new era in commercial space,” said Nasa mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing’s debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. Nasa had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port’s installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but Nasa decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams’ spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station’s exterior frame. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Hawaii is 50th American state Crime thanks to social media → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent His Majesty’s greetings conveyed Children celebrate National Day Iraq forces close in on IS fortress in Mosul Brexit fallout to cost UK £122 billion over 5 years Read More ...

The Kochi-headquartered Air India Express (AIE), which gives a taste of the cultural, national and geographical heritage of the country in general and Kerala in particular through the ‘Express Tail Art,’ is all set to give passengers a taste of various ethnic cuisines.  Speaking to Express, officials of the airline said Air India Express had a fleet of 20 aircraft, and each of them carried images of the country’s cultural ethos or geographical diversity on the tail. “On the World Elephant Day, the AIE had used its flight bearing the image of elephant as a tool to honour elephants, create awareness on the critical threats faced by elephants and to ensure their survival,” they said. Similarly, Air India had a practice of naming its aircraft, and had named its Boeing fleet after various emperors of the country. Taking a cue from that, AIE came up with one of the most unusual liveries in the global airline industry. Each of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft has a different tail art with each side of the tail reflecting a particular aspect of India. Its exotic liveries are in sync with the airline’s theme, which include ancient martial art Kalarippayattu; snake boat; painted stork; peacock; white tiger; spotted deer; dance forms like bharatanatyam, kathakali, garba of Gujarat and Assamese folk dance Bihu; historic images of Ajanta and Ellora; Charminar; the Sun Temple of Konark; Victoria Memorial; Qutab Minar; Mysore Palace; and the Mehrangarh Fort Palace of Jodhpur. The images of towering snow capped Himalayas and the sun-kissed beaches across the Indian Peninsula have also found a place on the tail of AIE aircraft. Besides, AIE is currently all set to give a taste of the ethic food to its passengers. As part of the initiative, the airline has made a provision for passengers to book their favourite ethnic dishes 24 hours in advance. The airline will serve the food items demanded by passengers onboard the flight, be it the spicy fish curry of Kerala or the sweet dessert Gulab Jamun, along with the complementary meal. “It is an attempt to give passengers a taste of their own ethnic food, irrespective of the place of boarding, and the make the trip ‘homely,” said the officials. “AIE has also started an online platform on Facebook, on which passengers can book ticket and food and even lodge complaints,” they added.

Most Popular Author Copy Created with Sketch. By Eric Tegler Aug 4, 2016 The F-35 just flew a victory lap. Last month, three U.S. Air Force F-35As made the Atlantic crossing to appear at the Farnborough Air Show in England (while PM rode along in the tanker that refueled the Joint Strike Fighter). The debut came two years after the F-35 failed to make its first appearance at the international air show following an engine fire. Recent reports suggest the F-35 Lightning II may have finally turned a corner, overcoming the technical problems that have plagued its development and nearing readiness to serve in the field. It's a big moment for the long-awaited plane, and it's been a long, long time coming. The Joint Strike Fighter was declared operational by the Marine Corps in July 2015; the Air Force just declared initial operational capability (IOC) this week and the Navy hopes to do so by February 2019. If the schedule holds, the F-35 will be baseline operational 18 years after it was selected over Boeing's X-32, and 23 years after the program began. History is littered with multi-mission aircraft that never quite measured up. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below For over two decades, the F-35 has been the symbol of everything that's wrong with mammoth defense contracts: behind schedule, over budget, and initially, over-sold. How did things get this way, and how did the trillion-dollar albatross come out flying in the end? There Can Be Only One The development of the F-35 has been a mess by any measurement. There are numerous reasons, but they all come back to what F-35 critics would call the jet's original sin: the Pentagon's attempt to make a one-size-fits-all warplane, a Joint Strike Fighter. Most Popular When the program began in 1996, the JSF was conceived as a way to replace the F-16 Falcon, F-15E Eagle, A-10 Warthog, F/A-18 Hornet, and AV-8B Harrier across their respective roles and missions. The Joint Strike Fighter program called for a common design with three variants to share 80 percent of their parts. There would be the conventional F-35A, the Air Force's plane. There would be the short takeoff and landing (STOVL) F-35B for the Marines. The Navy would get the carrier landing F-35C. At its dawn, the F-35 was projected to be four times more effective than older, legacy fighters in air-to-air combat, eight times more effective in air-to-ground combat, and three times better at reconnaissance and suppression of enemy air defenses. Design goals called for the JSF to be the premier strike aircraft through 2040, second only to the F-22 Raptor in air supremacy. GIF Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The F-35 wouldn't just be shared across the branches of the U.S. military; it was to be shared around the world. A coalition of "partner nations" would not only fly and produce the aircraft but support it worldwide. Eventually, eight foreign partners—Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, and the United Kingdom—signed on to invest in and acquire the aircraft. To date, seven have received their first jets and eight have pilots and maintainers in training. Two of the three foreign military sale customers (Israel, Japan, and South Korea) will receive their first jets in 2016. Stll, we could have seen this coming, and not just because of the technical complexity involved in making a warplane for so many constituents. Long before the delays and overruns that riddles the F-35 program, history was littered with illustrations of multi-mission aircraft that never quite measured up. Take Germany's WWII Junkers Ju-88, or the 1970s Panavia Tornado, or even the original F/A-18. Today the Hornet is a mainstay of the American military, but when it debuted it lacked the range and payload of the A-7 Corsair and acceleration and climb performance of the F-4 Phantom it was meant to replace. That didn't sit well with the Marines. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below F-35 supporters were undaunted in the face of that evidence, adamant that the technological advances needed to make a do-it-all aircraft for several brances of the military had finally arrived. Back in 2000, I interviewed Lt. General Michael A. Hough of the U.S. Marine Corps, director/deputy director of the Joint Strike Fighter Program from 1997 to 2001. During the interview, Hough thumped the table with his fist, declaring the JSF would not suffer the problems of past multipurose aircraft, which were prone to run over budget and see their progress stall. The Rocky Years Things got rocky pretty quickly. The Air Force wanted a stealthy plane, and those stealth requirements drove a JSF design which, at least initially, did not have internal weapons bays. That didn't sit well with the Marines, who would demand their inclusion. This design change would add weight to the F-35. So would the Marines' desire for a vertical takeoff plane, something the USMC demanded because it said it had no alternative replacement for the Harrier. Defense journalist and War Is Boring blogger David Axe observed that "in demanding STOVL capability, the Marines foisted a fat, bulky airframe on the program, even though the Air Force's F-35A didn't really want to be that fat." Most Popular Building one plane for three branches wasn't the only place the JSF program ran into trouble. The Pentagon hoped to take advantage of "concurrency": that is, the idea of keeping down costs by building production planes at the same time it was finishing ground and flight testing. Never mind that most aspects of the F-35, from its engines and flight control system to its software and autonomic logistics system, were still in early stages of development at the program's outset and far from finished technologies ready to be integrated. You can imagine what happened. During the flight testing, the military found the F-35 needed structural and electronic modifications. The fact that it had already produced many of the aircraft made the fix far more expensive. In the decade following 2003, the program faced over a dozen major setbacks. They just kept coming and coming. In 2004, the F-35B was more than 2,000 pounds overweight, unable to meet its performance goals. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that, as a result of the policy of concurrent development, retrofitting aircraft with systems that were not fully functional or working as intended could be terribly expensive. By 2013, the cost of retrofitting was put at $1.7 billion. Starting in 2007, suspected Chinese cyber intrusions resulted in the theft of several terabytes of data related to the F-35's design and electronics systems. This attack and another 2012 hack of BAE Systems (which makes the F-35's flight control software, electronic warfare systems, aft fuselage, as well as its horizontal and vertical tails) forced hardware and software redesigns, adding more cost and delays. From a troublesome helmet mounted cueing system to inadequate ejection seats and logistics software, the F-35 has continued to face challenges. Who gets the blame for a 20-year misadventure? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The mess got so bad that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates removed JSF program manager Maj. Gen. David Heinz (USMC) in 2010 and delayed development even more. Problems assembling the F-35's four-piece wing and structural fatigue in one of the bulkheads supporting the wing on the F-35B, combinged with a strike at Lockheed Martin, forced reduced initial production buys. The cascade of woes nearly resulted in the cancellation of the F-35B in 2010-11. To avoid further delays resulting from design changes, in 2012 the Pentagon accepted a reduced combat radius for the F-35A and a longer takeoff run for the F-35B. The F-35B's estimated combat radius was reduced by 15 percent. (F-35Bs had to refuel 15 times on the recent transatlantic flight.) Who gets the blame for a 20-year misadventure? In 2013, the GAO's Michael Sullivan asserted that Lockheed had failed to get an early start on systems engineering and had not understood the technologies involved at the program's launch. But a RAND study the same year found the three F-35 variants had drifted so far apart during development that having a single base design may prove to be more expensive than if services had just built separate aircraft tailored to their own requirements from the get-go. And to this the fact that enormous defense projects almost always go over-budget and you've got a recipe for the start-and-stop, muddled first two decades of the F-35. The Price Tag and the Promise Cost estimates for the F-35 have changed yearly over the past 15 years. It's safe to say, though, that the program is the most expensive in U.S. history (so far), pegged at more than $320 billion in 2012. In 2014, the GAO found that the F-35 fleet would have operating costs 79 percent higher than the aircraft it was to replace. A 2015 Pentagon Selected Acquisition Report said that program costs had increased 43 percent from 2001, including unit cost (up 68 percent). The report added that the F-35A's cost per flying hour is $32,500 while the F-16C/D is $25,500. Private analysts have called the F-35 a "money pit," and argued that the purpose of Lockheed's extensive national and global supplier base—which includes 1,300 suppliers in 45 states and nine foreign countries—was not so much to realize logistics efficiency and security, but to make sure the Joint Strike Fighter was too big to fail. They succeeded. The F-35 may be one of the most derided and controversial warplanes, but it's here, nearly ready to go into service in force. That's a good thing. Frankly, we need the F-35. The average age of current USAF airframes stands 27 years, and it's nearly as bad in the Navy. Decades-old Marine airplanes are being brought back from the boneyard. As a fifth-generation aircraft, the F-35 offers new combat capabilities and information exploitation. It will work with the F-22 and our 4th generation fighters such as the F-18 and F-16 to "kick down the door" in defended environments. GIF The F-35 is, at least so far, a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. We have paid a steep price for it, the full accounting of which has yet to be reckoned. Let's hope it was worth it.

This compares to a profit of US$254 million (HK$1,972 million) for the same period in 2015. Earnings per share were US1.6 cents (HK9.0 cents) compared to US6.46 cents (HK50.1 cents) for the first six months of the previous year. The operating environment in the first half of 2016 was affected by economic fragility and intense competition. There was sustained pressure on revenues, reflecting suspension of fuel surcharges, weak currencies in some markets, weak premium class demand, particularly on long-haul routes, and a higher proportion of passengers transiting through Hong Kong. All these factors impacted the Group’s operating performance. The contribution from subsidiary and associated companies increased. The Group’s passenger revenue in the first six months of 2016 was US$4,309 million (HK$33,413 million), a decrease of 7.8% compared to the same period in 2015. Capacity increased by 4.2%, reflecting the introduction of new routes and increased frequencies on other routes. Load factor decreased by 1.4 percentage points, to 84.5%. Revenue was adversely affected by the suspension (from February) of fuel surcharges, which remained suspended for the rest of the period despite a subsequent rise in fuel prices. Yield fell by 10.1% to US cents (HK54.3 cents), reflecting the suspension of fuel surcharges, strong competition and adverse currency movements. There was a significant reduction in premium corporate travel, particularly on long-haul routes. Revenue from long-haul routes declined compared to the same period in 2015, despite a 4.7% increase in long-haul capacity. The Group’s cargo revenue in the first six months of 2016 was US$1,214 million (HK$9,415 million), a decrease of 17.2% compared to the same period in 2015. The cargo capacity of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair increased by 0.6%. The load factor decreased by 1.9 percentage points, to 62.2%. Tonnage carried decreased by 0.2%. The overall market was weak during the period, although tonnage stabilised in the second quarter. Yield fell by 17.6% to US$0.21 (HK$1.59), reflecting strong competition, overcapacity and the suspension (from April) of fuel surcharges. Demand on European routes continued to be weak and demand on transpacific routes weakened. India was one of the few routes where demand strengthened. The Group managed freighter capacity in line with demand and carried a higher percentage of cargo in the bellies of its passenger aircraft. Total fuel costs for Cathay Pacific and Dragonair (before the effect of fuel hedging) decreased by US$519 million (HK$4,023 million) (or 31.9%) compared with the first half of 2015, despite a rise in the price of fuel in the second quarter. A 33.3% decrease in average prices was partially offset by a 2.0% increase in consumption. Fuel remains the Group’s most significant cost, accounting for 29.1% of operating costs in the first half of 2016 (compared to 34.2% in the same period in 2015). Lower fuel prices were partially offset by fuel hedging losses. After taking hedging losses into account, fuel costs decreased by US$433 million (HK$3,360 million) (or 20.2%) compared with the first half of 2015. Congestion at Hong Kong International Airport and air traffic control constraints in the Greater China region continued to impose costs on the Group. The Group is doing more to improve the reliability of its operations. Productivity improvements kept the increase in non-fuel costs in the first half of 2016 below the increase in capacity. There was a 0.5% reduction in non-fuel costs per available ton kilometer. In response to weak revenues, the Group introduced measures intended to reduce non-operational costs. The Group is reviewing productivity and expenditure, has stopped the hiring and replacement of non-operationally critical staff, and is restricting non-essential discretionary spending. Despite these short-term measures, the Group continues to make long-term investments. Cathay Pacific introduced a passenger service to Madrid in June. This service has been well received. The airline will introduce passenger services to London Gatwick in September, using new Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft. It stopped operating flights to Doha in February but still offers codeshare services with Qatar Airways on this route. Dragonair did not introduce any new routes in the first half of 2016. Frequencies on Dragonair’s Da Nang, Penang, Wenzhou and Wuhan services were increased. Frequencies on Dragonair’s Clark and Kota Kinabalu services were reduced. There were no changes to the Group’s freighter network in the first half of 2016. Cathay Pacific will introduce a freighter service to Portland in November. The Group continued to manage freighter capacity in line with demand. Cathay Pacific took delivery of its first Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft in May. A second was delivered in July and the third in August. The airline is scheduled to take delivery of further nine aircraft of this type during the remainder of 2016. The A350-900XWBs are fuel efficient and have the right range, capacity and operating economics for the Group’s requirements. Cathay Pacific retired two Airbus A340-300 aircraft in the first half of 2016. It will retire one more aircraft of this type in the second half of this year and will retire the remaining four aircraft of this type in 2017. The airline will have retired our three remaining Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft by October. One parked Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft was delivered to Boeing in July and another aircraft of this type in August. The remaining two aircraft of this type will be delivered to Boeing in August and September. Cathay Pacific took delivery of its final Boeing 747-8F freighter in August. Product The new Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft have the latest cabins, seats and entertainment systems and inflight connectivity for passengers’ mobile devices. The Group opened a new lounge in Vancouver in May and reopened the business class lounge at The Pier at Hong Kong International Airport in June. The G16 lounge in Hong Kong closed for renovations in July and will reopen in the second quarter of 2017. The Group’s new first and business class lounge at London Heathrow will open in the third quarter of 2016. In January the Group announced that Dragonair is to be rebranded as Cathay Dragon, bringing the brands of its two airlines into closer alignment. The first aircraft with the Cathay Dragon livery went into service in April. Cathay Pacific Chairman John Slosar said: “We expect the operating environment in the second half of the year to continue to be impacted by the same adverse factors as in the first half. The overall business outlook therefore remains challenging. We expect passenger yield to remain under pressure. Overcapacity and economic fragility will dampen cargo demand. Fuel prices have increased this year, but are still lower than in previous periods. The benefits from lower fuel prices will continue to be partially offset by losses on our fuel hedging contracts. The fuel surcharge remains suspended. In this difficult environment, we will manage capacity and strive to make further improvements in operational efficiency. We will also continue to be vigilant on costs. “The strategic objective of the Cathay Pacific Group is to provide sustainable growth in shareholder value over the long term. To that end we will continue to build a modern and fuel-efficient fleet and to strengthen our network and will strive to provide a high standard of customer service. We will continue to develop our strategic relationship with Air China. As we celebrate our 70th anniversary, our commitment to the Hong Kong and its people remains unwavering. We will continue to make long-term strategic investments to develop and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s premier aviation hub.” SOURCESaudi Gazette TAGS Cathay Pacific Group profit SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleTerminal 5 — King Khalid International Airport Riyadh Next articleGoogle All-Stars Academy to debut in MENA region Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Sabic profit falls 6.8% QNB Group net profit up 11% in first nine months Profit NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,491,680FansLike 41,180FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts King’s Shoura address to shed light on domestic, foreign policies Nov 23, 2016 Kingdom to have two industrial mining cities Nov 23, 2016 ‘SR2,000 visa fee won’t affect most Indian pilgrims’ Nov 23, 2016 More Rohingyas flee to Bangladesh as violence spreads in Myanmar Nov 23, 2016 National program to optimize water, energy consumption Nov 23, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

During a spacewalk of 5 hours and 58 minutes on Friday, the two astronauts fixed the first two points of the International Docking Adapter (IDA), EFE news reported. The IDA's will be used for future arrivals of manned commercial aircraft from Boeing and SpaceX, developed under the NASA manned commercial programme, the agency said in a statement. The installation will give NASA an independent access to the ISS for the first time since the withdrawal of its fleet of space shuttles in 2011. So far, NASA depends on the Russian Soyuz vessels. Jeff Williams said in a statement that the IDA has opened a new chapter in the history of the ISS enabling the access for future commercial vehicles. The new docking mechanism was transported in June to the ISS aboard a Dragon capsule by California-based private firm SpaceX, after the first IDA was lost during the launch failure of a SpaceX flight in June 2015. According to NASA, commercial flights from Florida to the ISS will increase the time for US crews to devote to scientific research and help prepare astronauts for deeper space missions, including possible travel to Mars.  (With IANS inputs) First Published: Sunday, August 21, 2016 - 00:13 More from zeenews   India Indian Army chief meets Chinese army commander Punjab Assembly elections: Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur, hockey Olympian Pargat Singh to join Congress on Nov 28 Demonetisation: PM Modi may attend Rajya Sabha on Thursday More from India World Iraqi civilians flee as paramilitary groups close in on flashpoint town west of Mosul France to convene Syria meeting after Assad, allies launch ''total war'' Trump won with lowest minority vote in decades, fueling divisions More from World Sports 'I am only 31', Parthiv Patel sends people reminder after being included in Indian squad Ace shuttlers Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu enter second round at Hong Kong Super Series Ross Taylor cleared for 2nd Test against Pakistan, will undergo eye-surgery post match More from Sports Entertainment Are you a party animal?

During a spacewalk of 5 hours and 58 minutes on Friday, astronauts Jeff Williams, Commander of the 48th expedition and flight engineer Kate Rubins, fixed the first two points of the International Docking Adapter (IDA), EFE news reported. The IDA’s will be used for future arrivals of manned commercial aircraft from Boeing and SpaceX, developed under the NASA manned commercial programme, the agency said in a statement. The installation will give NASA an independent access to the ISS for the first time since the withdrawal of its fleet of space shuttles in 2011. So far, NASA depends on the Russian Soyuz vessels. Jeff Williams said in a statement that the IDA has opened a new chapter in the history of the ISS enabling the access for future commercial vehicles. The new docking mechanism was transported in June to the ISS aboard a Dragon capsule by California-based private firm SpaceX, after the first IDA was lost during the launch failure of a SpaceX flight in June 2015. According to NASA, commercial flights from Florida to the ISS will increase the time for US crews to devote to scientific research and help prepare astronauts for deeper space missions, including possible travel to Mars. –IANS ss/ksk/vm Tags ISS Jeff Williams NASA used CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Google glass technology dangerous for drivers: Study Nov 23rd, 201607 New York, Nov 23 (IANS) Head-up display technology -- think Google Glass -- offers lots of information to...

The first flight for this year’s Hajj was historic as it departed the Tamale International Airport directly to Saudi Arabia. The flight, Boeing 740-400 series, was seen off by President John Dramani Mahama and the Chief Imam, Sheikh Osman Shaributu. The second and third batches are scheduled to depart Tamale for Medina before those in Accra will be airlifted to the Kingdom for the Islamic rite. After arrival on Friday, the 500 Ghanaians were checked in into their hotel. The would-be pilgrims were taken through strict rules guiding this year’s rite by the Pilgrims Affairs Office of Ghana (PAOG). Before going aboard the Saudi Arabia government-owned Nas Airline flight, they had been screened by officers of the Ghana Immigration Service, Ghana Airport Company, the military, National Security and other auxiliary staff. A special prayer service was held for all those embarking on this year’s Hajj Friday morning.

NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender "out of the box concepts" for the space station since the agency says it's become clear that "companies don't think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues." VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined," the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed "to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability." NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. "It's an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station," said NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn't have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions "from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies," Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an e-mail. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is "emblematic" of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK's Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. "The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies," Culbertson said. "As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a testbed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA's increasingly ambitious missions to deep space." Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station's "primary structural hardware" and determine whether the outpost's functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don't have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body-from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure-as a way to make longer missions feasible. » Next page...

Now, the former Alton High standout is trying to make it a fulfilling career. She’s participating in the Professional Women’s Bowling Association Tour and trying to carve out a niche for herself in the PWBA competition. “The PWBA re-started again last year and this is my first year on the tour,” said the 31-year-old Purkey, a propulsion engineer at Boeing in St. Louis. “There are 14 stops on the summer tour and they were all over the country. It’s really exciting to be on the tour.” The events started April 28 in Las Vegas and ended Aug. 7 in Chicagoland’s Addison. The Smithfield Tour championship unfolds Sept. 1-4 in Midlothian, Va. Purkey picked her spots the way she converted her spares — smoothly. Because she holds a regular job, her PWBA competition is secondary. Nevertheless, Purkey has a sponsor that pays for some of her expenses, including clothing. “I competed in seven of the stops this year,” she said, pointing to action in Detroit, Chicago and Green Bay, among others. Purkey cashed in one check for $1,200 for a Top 32 finish; thus, she’s making some progress. “There’s not enough money to compete on the tour full time, but I love it,” Purkey said. “It’s a great opportunity for me.” The PWBA is attempting to regain its luster after losing gloss when it ceased operations in 2003. The league had been around since 1960. It came back to life in 2015. “When I heard it was coming back, I wanted to compete in it,” Purkey said. “I was bowling in some leagues in St. Louis and there were a lot of good friends from college still bowling.” All she had to do was register for the PWBA. “You had to have a 190 average to bowl in it,” Purkey said. “Honestly, I think it will keep growing. I’m planning on competing in it for the next three or four years. At least, that’s the plan.” Bowling has become a natural activity for her and it’s easy to see why. Purkey, has been doing it for a long time and enjoyed her share of success. “I started bowling when I was 5 years old, so basically I’ve been doing it all my life,” Purkey said. Dad, Jay, got her involved as well as older sister Whitney, a 2001 AHS graduate. It was Whitney Cox reigning as the IHSA girls’ state bowling champion in 2001 following her sixth-place finish in 2000. Ashley placed sixth in 2002 and sixth in 2003, her senior season. When Ashley was a sophomore, she bowled with Whitney. AHS coach Jeff Woszczynski benefited from having both sisters propel the program. Alton qualified for state in 2001 and 2003, finishing 10th each time. They kick-started the success the Redbirds enjoyed on the lanes after that. Overall, the boys and girls have gone to the state finals 14 times, beginning 15 years ago. “And Ashley just missed medaling at state her sophomore year,” Woszczynski said of 2001. “When Whitney won state, everything changed for her about bowling. “Ashley has always been a very determined bowler. She even married a bowler (Kevin Purkey) and he’s a very good bowler. “I give Ashley a lot of credit for taking a shot on the bowling tour,” Woszczynski added. During her prep days, Purkey said she maintained a 215-to-220 average. She went on to bowl collegiately at Wichita State and the Shockers won the NCAA championship in 2007. Now, Purkey sports a 225 average. “I’m passionate about bowling and I’ve always wanted to be a pro bowler,” she said. “Coach (Woszczynski) stimulated my interest in bowling. He was a good coach and we had some good teams.” Follow #AdVsports on Twitter Tags Alton High School featured bowling by Steve Porter August 20, 2016 12:00 AM Local News News Crime Business Legal Sports Team Spotlight College signings Obituaries Features Spotlight Arts & Entertainment Commentary Announcements Births Recipes Religion Puzzles Contribute Submit a news tip Submit a sports tip Submit a letter to the editor Submit a calendar event Obituary Information Birth announcement form Anniversary announcement form Engagement announcement form Wedding announcement form Financial Institution Guide questionnaire Women In Small Business Suggestion Box Contests Greater Alton Sports Trivia answer Granite City Sports Trivia answer Edwardsville Sports Trivia answer Pro Picks Challenge Reader's Choice 2016 Nominations - Granite City Advertise Business advertising Garage Sales Classifieds Sunday circulars Love Lines Novena ad Celebration ad Memorial ad Graduation ad Bridal Event Booth Space Veterans Day ad Events Submit events Garage Sales About Contact us Pickup locations Careers Archives Team Spotlight College signings Contact Us Advertise My Account AdVantage News | 235A East Center Drive, Alton, IL 62002 | Phone: 618.463.0612 | Copyright 2014 Built with Metro Publisher™
    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Bread and Circuses: The F-35 Buzzes Over Chicago by Jared Labell, August 20, 2016 Print This | Share This If the city of Chicago were a house, the State would have condemned it as blighted property long ago, bulldozing its rotten wood and crumbling concrete structure into a pile fit for a funeral pyre. Chicago hasn’t been condemned yet, despite the city’s abundance of bureaucrats, infamous history of government corruption and violence wrought upon its residents, and its atrocious financial standing. Chicago remains a dilapidated house, but one that’s on the verge of burning down in a self-inflicted economic arson fire. With that in mind, the city will begin to close out the summer this weekend with the 58th Annual Chicago Air and Water Show on Saturday August 20th and Sunday August 21st along North Avenue Beach. Similar to the bread and circuses of empires past, Chicago annually distracts taxpayers with big, shiny objects to take their minds off of the political and economic failures of their government. This year’s free event is no different, as festivities are draped in the flag and promoted heavily with food, drinks, and fun for the entire family. Among other participants and aircraft featured in the event, the centerpiece of the show this year is the rollout of the notorious F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Corporate sponsors Shell and Boeing, as well as media outlets like WBBM Newsradio, ABC 7 television, and The Chicago Tribune, help underwrite the cost of the show, making it free for the public’s enjoyment. But don’t thank these sponsors for the free entertainment just yet, because nothing is free, and when the F-35 is involved, rest assured that taxpayers are picking up the tab, one way or another. Just a few weeks ago, Antiwar.com published my synopsis of the F-35 program –  I’m Paying Taxes, But What Am I Buying? – which detailed the $400 billion jet’s beleaguered history of cost overruns, operational fiascoes, and the opportunity costs of maintaining a weapons system that’s projected to incinerate trillions of dollars from US taxpayers throughout the estimated duration of its production and deployment lifecycle. The Straus Military Reform Project, part of the Project on Government Oversight’s Center for Defense Information, offers another detailed rundown of the most expensive weapons system in history. Readers are encouraged to become well-acquainted with the Department of Defense’s worst boondoggle, as the F-35 is a prime example of how the government misspends tax dollars at an alarming rate and with little to no accountability. Unless a coalition of activists, taxpayers, and average folks from across the political spectrum demand accountability for this detrimental misallocation of resources, we will be no better off than those poor souls in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. As Orwell wrote, “War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea…” resources that were confiscated from the public and funneled into lavish government military programs, like those fabled Floating Fortresses in his seminal novel. Chicago’s Air and Water Show comes just a little more than a week after it was announced that the Pentagon granted Lockheed Martin, the F-35’s manufacturer, an additional $1 billion of our tax dollars to make up for expenses associated with low-rate initial production costs incurred by the company. The joint program office obligated the funding by way of a preexisting undefinitized contract action (UCA), but that’s not the end of the largesse. “The agreement has a not-to-exceed value of $5.37 billion, meaning that the government could use it to inject even more cash at a later date,” reported Defense News. Previous to this newest round of corporate welfare handouts, Lockheed Martin CFO Bruce Tanner had said of the F-35’s production issues and cost overruns, “We will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation. We simply don’t have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I’m optimistic that we are going to get cash soon.” Tanner’s optimism was logical. Of course the Pentagon would pay up. Old Right journalist John T. Flynn dispelled the myth of the supposedly positive aspects of military Keynesianism in his book, As We Go Marching, warning of “an economy supported by great streams of debt and an economy under complete control, with nearly all the planning agencies functioning with almost totalitarian power under a vast bureaucracy." Flynn’s thorough indictment of the New Deal-era warfare state and America’s lunge toward economic collectivism is as relevant today as it was then. Most of the post-World War II factions of the War Party are still operating under the same delusions as their antecedents, and Flynn emphasized that politicians, laborers, and businesses would sadly embrace imperialism and economic ruin because of the perverse incentives of Empire. “Thus militarism is the one great glamorous public-works project upon which a variety of elements in the community can be brought into agreement,” Flynn wrote mournfully more than seventy years ago.

These F-35’s are actually useless against Russia’s Krasukha line of electromagnetic warfare systems. Brian McKeever Not sure what the boondoggle F-35 has to do with the rest of this article, but as a former resident of the city who only moved to advance his career it is pretty clear the author of this piece has never lived there. Chicago’s government may be dysfunctional, but a large portion of Chicago–particularly the North and Northwest sides and the strip along the lake–are quite livable. I very much enjoyed my time in that city. Jared Labell Hi Brian. If you look at the bio following the article, you’ll notice that I do in fact live and work in Chicago. I fight taxes and the state for a living. As a former resident, you may be unaware that Chicago increased property taxes by more than $500 million last year, and through this year’s state stopgap budget, an additional $250 million property tax hike is soon to befall the city — all to pay for government pensions, not services. Nothing else. And more tax hikes are on the horizon. So the connection should be obvious, it’s the bread and circuses — distracting the public with a large spectacle, in this case militaristic and nationalist fervor in the form of a costly air and water show, sponsored by the media and corporate interests, and all the whole the city is going broke. When did you leave Chicago? It is clear to me from reading comment that it must have been long ago, if at all. Don’t defend governments. It’s unseemly.

The 86-ton antennas, which the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company acquired from NASA’s KennedySpaceCenter at Cape Canaveral, will be used to track flights of the crewed version of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station, probably in 2017. The company already has made multiple cargo runs between Earth and ISS using its uncrewed Dragon capsules, driven into space by the company’s Falcon 9 rockets. In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to rendezvous with ISS. SpaceX and Boeing both have contracts to fly crews to ISS. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has depended on Russian Soyuz flights to get astronauts to ISS. As one of the contract’s “milestones,” NASA requires SpaceX to track the flights from ground stations at various locations, thus the Boca Chica antennas. The company broke ground on a launch site at Boca Chica in September 2014 with the company’s CEO and chief designer and then-governor Rick Perry on hand. SpaceX plans 12 launches per year from the site once it’s complete. The company had planned the first launch from Boca Chica for 2016, though it discovered the site needed to be stabilized, which involved trucking in 310,000 cubic yards of soil and has delayed construction. The revised schedule has the first Boca Chica launch taking place sometime in 2018. SpaceX said the first ground station antenna will arrive at Boca Chica via tractor-trailer in October. A thick concrete foundation will have to be poured first and allowed to cure for at least one month before the antenna is installed, the company said. The antenna’s heavy hydraulics will be removed prior to shipping and replaced by electronics once at Boca Chica. According to the contract, SpaceX must have the first antenna installed before the end of the year and “qualified” (certified by NASA as being installed correctly) by spring, SpaceX said. No date has been set for shipment of the second antenna, the company said. NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said SpaceX has been awarded two “post-certification” missions to ISS, which can proceed only after two successful test flights are completed. “The way the program works is we’ll have two test flights: one uncrewed — obviously that would come first — then crewed,” she said. Thompson said the crewed test flight will involve two astronauts, though she didn’t know how many would be traveling to ISS on the first actual mission. All flights are scheduled to take place in 2017, though Thompson said specific dates haven’t been set. sclark@brownsvilleherald.com Discuss Print Posted in Business on Saturday, August 13, 2016 10:16 pm.

United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing, sent a pair of U.S. Air Force satellites into space on a Delta IV rocket on Friday. The launch from Cape Canaveral went smoothly about an hour after midnight at 0052edt (0452gmt). The rocket will deliver two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program into near geo-synchronous orbit later in the morning. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) fulfilled a similar mission for the Air Force on July 28, 2014. The launch marked the 110th mission for ULA since it was founded in 2006 and the seventh so far in 2016.

The Pentagon is looking to lasers as a cheaper, more effective way to shoot down long-range missiles fired at the United States by North Korea and Iran. After experimenting with the technology for more than a decade, U.S. military officials said “directed energy” is near the point where they could use it on the battlefield. “It’s not a hope. This is what we’re doing,” Vice Adm. James Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, said Wednesday. “I view this [as] highly important for the future.” Syring and other military officials struck a common theme at this week’s annual Space and Missile Defense Symposium, arguing that lasers could ultimately augment existing missile interceptors. They want lasers for two main reasons: they could shoot down missiles earlier than today’s interceptors and they’re much cheaper to fire. “We have to deal with the fact that our interceptors are more costly,” said Katrina McFarland, the Army’s acting acquisition executive. “The cost dimension of warfare must be switched from our side to the adversary side.” Army leaders are concerned that they might have to fire expensive interceptors against far cheaper rockets or small drones packed with explosives. “The problem we have now is the worldwide demand for missile defense is greater than the capacity,” James Johnson, director of the Future Warfare Center of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said Monday at a Defense One Cocktails and Conversation in Huntsville. Congress has appropriated $119 billion for U.S. missile defense projects, including ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California, deployable THAAD interceptors, and radars, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. The Pentagon has asked Congress for $34.87 billion for these projects between fiscal 2017 and 2021. “Spending will likely continue at roughly the current rate for the foreseeable future,” the think tank said in a recent report. The Navy recently deployed a prototype 30-kilowatt laser on the USS Ponce. The laser, it says, can shoot down small drones and disable speedboats. And it only costs less than $1 to fire compared to missiles, which usually cost millions of dollars a piece. But shooting down a missile would take far more power and hundreds of kilowatts. The technology has to shrink before a fighter jet or drone could carry a laser powerful enough to shoot down a missile. “That’s why we’re pursuing the technology in terms of trying to mature, not just the technology, but drive the size and weight down and we can start to think operationally about what that means,” Syring said. The goal is to reduce the size and weight of existing lasers, something the Pentagon has been trying to do for the past decade. Unlike existing missile interceptors, which collide with enemy rockets in the middle or latter phases of a launch, an anti-ballistic missile laser would attempt to shoot down missiles as they are being boosted toward outer space. The Pentagon tried to do this with the Airborne Laser project last decade, an expensive project in which a laser on an aircraft ultimately shot down a missile in the boost phase during a test. A major issue with the test was that the plane carrying the laser, a Boeing 747, had to get close to the site where missile launched. The massive plane had to carry chemicals needed to power the laser. The aircraft’s size made it a sitting duck to enemy aircraft and missile systems. The Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct “a lot of” testing with lasers mounted on Reaper drones “over the next few years” culminating with a “low-power laser demonstrator” project in 2021, Syring said. Pentagon officials hope to decide what that demonstrator might look like “in a few years.” The goal of that project is to fly a powerful laser at a high altitude that can track possibly kill a missile soon after it is launched, during its boost phase. In addition to lasers on drones, the Army is eying lasers on the ground to shoot down missiles. Lt. Gen. David Mann, the head of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Forces Strategic Command, who briefly spoke at this week’s conference, referenced improvements to the Army’s Avenger, a Humvee-mounted system that fires Stinger missiles at cruise missiles, with lasers or other forms of directed energy. “That’s something that’s getting a lot of interest,” he said. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said lasers might be sooner used for tactical missile defense, currently done by systems like Avenger or Israel’s Iron Dome, but in time could be mounted on drones that would attempt to shoot down the missiles soon after they blast off. The maturation of laser technology in recent years is helping to drive interest, said Doug Graham, vice president of missile systems and advanced programs for Lockheed Martin. “We’ve been putting a fair amount of efforts ourselves into maturing some of the few technologies, building on the capabilities that we have,” he said. Lockheed acquired Aculight, a Bothell, Washington-based company that builds lasers, in 2008 to better position itself to win Pentagon work. The company has also been self-funding laser development work and Lockheed is working on a 60-kilowatt laser for the Army. “We expect to see the power levels continue to increase,” Graham said. “The beauty of this is it’s still remaining pretty nice and compact.” Shooting down a missile requires more than the laser itself, it involves steering mirrors, adaptive optics and software that can track a target. Both Lockheed and Boeing – which has built a high-power laser for the Army Stryker vehicles – showed off small drones with holes burned through them by low-power lasers. To destroy a missile screaming toward outer space, a much more powerful, “couple hundred kilowatts” laser is needed, Graham said. “We’re not there yet, but I think our view is within five years, we’re going to be there,” he said. “We’ll be able to demonstrate … a lethality of the boost phase.” —Courtesy: DO [Marcus Weisgerber is the global business editor for Defense One, where he writes about the intersection of business and national security.

That doesn’t mean the $509 million project would be dead this year — there’s a workaround involving South Carolina funds that could kickstart dredging while waiting on federal lawmakers to act. But Barbara Melvin, the State Ports Authority executive who’s led efforts to get dredging authorized, said state legislators will push to get some floor time for the Water Resources Development Act during the busy post-Labor Day calendar. Without authorization, the federal government can’t devote money to the project. “It’s critical that they don’t adjourn without a WRDA bill,” said Melvin, the SPA’s senior vice president of operations and terminals. Both the House and Senate versions of the WRDA include Charleston Harbor deepening on their lists of approved Army Corps of Engineers projects. Both versions have made it past the committee level and, while Melvin said that’s helpful, “we have to pull this across the finish line.” South Carolina Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, have requested time to debate the bill in September. U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican whose district includes Charleston, is expected to do the same in the House. Graham, during last month’s groundbreaking for a new Mercedes-Benz Vans manufacturing site in North Charleston, reiterated his determination to find federal dollars for the harbor dredging. “We’re going to do everything we can to get it to 52 feet,” he said, “if I have to get a shovel myself.” Melvin said the House version might be the easiest to push through because “it’s a cleaner bill,” without any of the Senate provisions that might raise objections. For example, the Senate version includes revolving loan funds for drinking water and wastewater systems and financial assistance for localities with polluted drinking water, such as Flint, Mich. Even if one of the versions makes it to the floor for debate, time constraints will make passage difficult. The House will be in session from Sept. 6 to Sept. 30 before taking another recess until after the election. Senators will be in session until Oct. 7, when they will break for the election. Both chambers plan to close out the legislative session on Dec. 16. If a water bill doesn’t pass by then, the SPA could seek a permit from the Army Corps to begin dredging by using some of the roughly $300 million the state has already set aside as its share of funding for the project. The federal portion would then be used at some future date, after a water bill is approved. That’s a last-resort measure that Melvin said the SPA would rather not pursue. If nothing else, she said, Congress should at least approve the list of projects included for authorization in the current water bill. In addition to the Charleston deepening, both versions of the WRDA include authorization for more than $1 billion in navigation projects at places such as Port Everglades in Florida and Portsmouth Harbor in New Hampshire. There have been roughly 450 deliveries of Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner since production of the plane started in North Charleston and Everett, Wash. Japan’s All Nippon Airways accounts for about one out of every nine of those deliveries. ANA last week took delivery of its 50th Dreamliner — a 787-9 model built in Everett — to complete an order placed in 2004. ANA was the first airline to bring the Dreamliner into service in 2011 and the carrier has notched more than 125,000 flights with the fuel-efficient wide-body since then. “The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet,” Osamu Shinobe, ANA’s president and CEO, said in a statement. As part of its global expansion efforts, ANA said it plans to launch new Dreamliner routes from Tokyo to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September and from Tokyo to Mexico City in February. Already the world’s largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s on order, including the longest and newest 787-10, which will be built exclusively at Boeing’s North Charleston campus.

This NASA TV video grab shows U.S. astronaut Kate Rubins working outside the International Space Station with the SpaceX Dragon space freighter just below her on August 19. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the space station for commercial purposes.  (HO / AFP/Getty Images)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Sun., Aug. 21, 2016 After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavours 250 miles (403 kilometres) above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. Article Continued Below The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion (U.S.) deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020.  During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body — from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure — as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and non-profit organizations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

"NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit" During a panel discussion on NASA’s plans for a mission to Mars, Hill discussed some of the agency’s long-term plans for reaching the red planet. These plans include close collaboration with commercial spaceflight companies such as SpaceX. "NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit," Hill said, "Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, we figure that will be in the mid-20s." The statement came just before astronauts aboard the station were preparing to install a new docking adaptor to the station. Hill’s timeline coincides with the Obama administration’s plans to wind down the United States' commitment to the station as it ages. The station’s operational life has been extended until 2024. The station was originally designed to last through 2015 Since construction began on the station in 2000, the International Space Station exists in a harsh environment in the 16 years that its orbited the Earth. Originally designed to last through 2015, the station’s primary contractor, Boeing, is studying whether or not it will be feasible to operate the station beyond 2028, almost twice the amount of time it was designed for. With the rise of a private space industry, and a decline in governmental commitments to the station, commercial partners will be essential in maintaining the station. However, because of the station’s cost, it’s not clear exactly what this arrangement will look like, or if any of the commercial space companies out there will be interested. As NASA sets its sights on Mars, the fate of the station will likely depend on its role in future interplanetary missions.

My brother graduated from CHS in 1962. His sons and my sons all graduated from Cathedral. Cathedral taught me what moral values and spiritual commitment means. That school made me and my sons who they are today, successful and honorable. Sadly, I cannot in good conscience support a gala that is being headlined by a racist, albeit a famous coach. Is my school that desperate for funds that we must listen to someone who supports Donald Trump’s divisive racism and cultural bias? I thought Pope Francis said this was the Year of Mercy. I will not in any way support an event that features a speaker who insults my culture, my family, my community, my school, my city and my beliefs. Do the right thing. Cancel his appearance and I will be there to applaud your courage and commitment to the history and beliefs Cathedral is so proud of. Luis Villalobos East Side Taxes and utility rates are crushing El Paso The headlines tell us that our local politicians have the audacity to give themselves a raise that exceeds my entire annual income! For what? Increased productivity? We are being overwhelmed. The El Paso Independent School District wants to spend billions in order to save money. The El Paso Electric Co. needs more profits, and not just a little increase. The police and the fire departments need a higher quality of life. We must save all the abandoned dogs and feral cats. We must feed the refugees. This nation was born of a tax revolt and surely the founders must be rolling over in their graves. Gary Gossett West Side Temporary bus stop unsafe, unclean The trolley construction on Oregon forced Sun Metro in June to relocate and consolidate several bus stops between University Avenue and Las Palmas Hospital into a single stop on Mesa alongside University Towers’ parking lot. All the previous stops had shade, benches and trash cans. The new “temporary” stop has no such amenities. I’m aged and disabled. On one particularly hot afternoon, I nearly passed out at that stop waiting for a late bus. Meanwhile, the lack of even one trash receptacle often leaves that stop an eyesore, litter covering the ground. Sun Metro’s rule of no eating or drinking on buses (which some drivers enforce, others don’t) forces riders to drop their containers on the ground before boarding, thus breaking the state’s anti-littering law. "Don't mess with Texas" indeed! If Sun Metro cannot provide shelter or benches at that stop for whatever reason, could it at least move one or more trash cans from the out-of-service stops to this one so people will stop littering? Leo Miletich Sunset Heights Don’t forget cost of moving EPISD HQ With all the attention on the $669 million bond issue for EPISD, one thing has been dropped out of the equation, the need for a new central office complex to replace the Boeing site. The district is several years behind in building on land they already own in the Northeast, or acquiring a new property, such as the Downtown site they are looking at. The Northeast site would be the best choice as it is already owned by the district, has room for any size complex they wish to build, room for parking, and more importantly, room for the planetarium, which is a great teaching tool. The Downtown site is too small for district needs, and no room for the planetarium. But, with either choice, or another, certificates of obligation, separate from any bond election would have to be used. These do not have to have voter approval and would further impact any future tax rate. Why has the board been very quiet about this ongoing problem? Robert Word West Side Angry at taxes? Then vote in November EPISD is requesting a bond issue that would increase taxes. The county commissioners just voted themselves a hefty raise. El Paso Electric is increasing our rates, and now, University Medical Center is requesting a tax increase. How is anyone going to improve their quality of life with these constant tax increases? Go to the polls in November El Paso and vote. Vote for the people that are going to stop taxing us into the poor house.

(Photo: TIM SHORTT/ FLORIDA TODAY)Buy Photo 78 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE In 2004, Dante Lauretta and friends sketched out the concept for an asteroid science mission on a cocktail napkin at the bar in Tucson's Arizona Inn. This week at Kennedy Space Center, Lauretta will see the SUV-sized NASA spacecraft that emerged from that meeting, the centerpiece of an $800 million NASA science mission, for the last time. Technicians on Wednesday and Thursday plan to enclose the robotic probe called OSIRIS-REx inside the nose cone of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket scheduled to launch Sept. 8 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. “I’ve come to really enjoy visiting the spacecraft and seeing it grow up,” Lauretta, the mission’s lead scientist from the University of Arizona, said Saturday at KSC. “I’m happy to send it on the journey to Bennu and back.” FLORIDA TODAY Delta IV blasts off with threat-detecting military satellites Bennu is the dark, carbon-rich space rock, measuring about 1,600 feet across, that the mission hopes to begin approaching two years from now. The asteroid discovered in 1999 is a geologic remnant of the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago, potentially holding organic molecules thought to be precursors of life on Earth. “It’s extremely primitive,” said Christina Richey, deputy program scientist at NASA headquarters. “We have preserved material from the very beginning of our solar system. That’s why this is such an important rock.” Upon arriving at Bennu, instruments on the spacecraft built by Lockheed Martin will produce the most detailed map ever of an asteroid’s surface study its composition. That information will help identify a target for collecting a sample. In July 2020, the more than 4,000-pound craft will arrive at what Lauretta called its “golden moment.” With an 11-foot arm outstretched, it will drop down for a gentle, five-second “kiss” of Bennu. A burst of gas will push at least 2 ounces of loose gravel and dirt in a container.

During more than two years of flying in formation with the asteroid, the mission can make up to three attempts to collect the sample. The team hopes only one is needed, but the asteroid’s makeup remains uncertain for now. Because the sample collection likely will occur with the asteroid on the other side of the sun from Earth, it will take 18 minutes before mission managers know how it went. In 2010, a Japanese mission returned particles from a different kind of asteroid. But OSIRIS-REx plans to bring back significantly more material from Bennu. “This will be the largest sample return since the Apollo era,” said Richey. A small, solar-powered capsule like one used by NASA’s Stardust mission, which returned comet dust in 2006, will carry the asteroid regolith home to a landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. FLORIDA TODAY Rubio: U.S. space program not 'Third World' as Trump says Mission scientists will keep a quarter of it, leaving the rest for future generations to study. To help ensure any sample collected is a pristine one, precautions are being taken to avoid contamination of the spacecraft and its instruments. Teams working in a high bay at KSC’s Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility on Saturday, and media invited to photograph the spacecraft, wore clean room suits and were instructed not to wear perfume, cologne, hair spray, nail polish or makeup. Materials with amino acids, including nylon, were not allowed inside. During the mission, OSIRIS-REx also will study how heating by the sun helps propel small asteroids, a process essential to accurately predicting their trajectories. There’s a very small chance — less than one tenth of 1 percent — that Bennu could pose a threat to Earth within the next 200 years. OSIRIS-REx is an acronym for "Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer." “It’s really exciting,” Lauretta said of the spacecraft’s encapsulation this week in the Atlas V payload fairing. “It’s the next major step in getting to the launch pad.” Contact Dean at 321-242-3668 orjdean@floridatoday.com.

Grace Pascoe reports on the first day of the Singapore Air Show. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Planemakers must deal with both the yin and the yang. Whilst the global economy falters, demand for aircraft remains strong. At Singapore's biennial airshow Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier remains confident in the industry. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AIRBUS PRESIDENT AND CEO, FABRICE BREGIER, SAYING: "People try to project themselves into the future and the impact of air traffic. As a matter of fact, we don't see it, our competitors don't see it, our customers don't see it, we have never been so healthy, this is the reality. And we are planning for more efficient aircraft for deliveries as you can see, which go well beyond 2020." Neither Airbus, nor Boeing expect delay to deliveries or cancellation requests. And production lines are loaded for rapid growth After a boom in orders has defied the industry's growing number of sceptics. Airbus COO John Leahy says middle class spending is driving aviation. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AIRBUS COO, JOHN LEAHY, SAYING: "They fly for business, they have disposable income they fly for pleasure, and they're the ones who are sitting in the seats of airliners around the world. And the middle class in Asia Pacific will be driving the world going forward. And of course there is also South America and parts of Africa, etc. other parts of emerging markets. This is the key, this is the growth engine, that's driving our industry." No large orders have been placed yet at the airshow. But with oil at multi-year lows, and airline balance sheets strong New orders may be on the cards.

(Photo: Desert Sun file) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Bicycles are the future I began reading Dana Hobart’s Aug. 15 Valley Voice, “Address CV Link questions,” with interest that quickly turned to disgust. Mr. Hobart makes the same mistake many people make with regard to bicycles; he apparently views them as toys. The modern bicycle is the most efficient means of transportation ever developed. It is used for transportation, hauling, and even recreation. By the end of this week I will have ridden my bicycle close to 100 miles, commuting, shopping, running errands, and no miles for recreation. Forward-looking cities such as Davis, Calif., Portland, Ore., and Seattle, Wash., are incorporating bicycles and bicycle infrastructure into their transportation plans. CVAG and valley cities except Rancho Mirage and apparently Indian Wells recognize this potential and wish to do likewise. The CV Link will provide a safe, arterial route for bicycles from which class 2 tributary routes can reach essentially the entire valley, except for Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells. When it comes to cost, bicycle infrastructure is probably the cheapest transportation improvement that can be made by far. The DMV classifies bicycles as “vehicles.” Vehicles travel on roadways so it seems to me CV Link is a roadway. George H. Stock, Bermuda Dunes Hobart ignores CV Link benefit In his Aug. 15 Valley Voice Rancho Mirage Councilman Dana Hobart attacks a funding mechanism for one of the most forward-thinking and beneficial Coachella Valley development projects as a “four-year, under-the-radar scheme.” To the contrary, concerned citizens throughout the desert have had ample opportunities to attend neighborhood workshops and presentations over the past several years. Transparency and community input have been a standard throughout the process. Hobart asserts the use of Measure A funds as part of the financing for the project needs to be litigated in Superior Court. The highly respected firm of Best, Best, and Krieger’s argument in favor of the authority to use Measure A funding is strong and compelling. It speaks volumes that one of the earliest funding commitments came from the Desert Healthcare District. This reflects what any caring person acknowledges; CV Link’s trail for runners and bike riders will provide a critically needed exercise component that will go far in fighting our obesity epidemic. There are thirty-seven elementary and seven middle schools within one mile of the CV Link Trail. Hobart’s failure to accept and embrace this point of view leads me to question his compassion and judgment. Vic Gainer, Palm Springs DESERT SUN We must clear questions on CV Link funding, popularity They’ve served, they deserve On a 110 degree August weekend, where would Marines, Navy corpsman and their families rather be: Baking in the sun at world’s largest Marine base or relaxing at a great Palm Springs resort? Many hundreds of the base’s 25,000 Marines and their families would jump at the chance to experience Palm Springs, even at 110 degrees. Why not create a simple two-day affordable package with some freebie or discounts for them? This proposal was sent to Mayor Rob Moon (cc: PS Tourism, PS Resorts) over two months ago. The response? “Staff reviewing.” Marines are the nation’s first responders at the call of the president in frequent world crises. Next year some may be back in Iraq or Afghanistan. Many from Twentynine Palms have paid the ultimate price. Welcome our military friends to Palm Springs. They deserve R&R. If not August, how about September or some other slow weekend? It would fill hundreds of rooms and restaurant tables. Rick Stelk, Palm Springs Management styles Congratulations to SunLine Transit Agency on showing how a management team can achieve both efficiency and exemplary public service, plus make a major contribution to a more green planet. SunLine recently won government grant money for its foresighted leadership in managing their fleet and providing best of best service in public transportation. On the other hand, there is the “know-nothing-but-raise-rates” mentality management of the Coachella Valley Water District. Congratulations to them for more than doubling my water bill in one month due to a restructuring of charges. My six-month average water bill for 2016 was $16.35; my August bill is now $37.99. This is a clear validation of the old adage “No good deed goes unpunished.” I am sure the two top water dogs – Jim Barrett, general manager, and Robert Cheng, assistant general manager, with salaries of $268,000 and $247,000 respectively, plus health and life insurance, plus bonuses per annum up to 10 percent, etc., are working hard to keep all of our water bills reasonable. Ray Norris, Palm Desert We deserve the choice I feel the same way as the two (letter writers) in the Aug. 16 paper: I don’t think the hospital or a doctor should take that decision (to end one’s own life with physician aid) from the person who is ill or in pain from a noncurable disease. Emily Mclean, Palm Desert Ultimate choice must be ours Desert Regional Medical Center, Eisenhower Medical Center and JFK Memorial Hospital; how dare they refuse to let a doctor honor a dying person’s wish to avoid more pain until the inevitable outcome, prolonging the agony for their families to see their needless suffering? Could it be the motive of these hospitals is to keep people alive as long as possible to boost their bottom line? California’s End of Life Option Act allows terminally ill adults in California with less than six months to live to get a doctor’s prescription for a lethal dose of “aid-in-dying” drugs. Shouldn’t these institutions care more for their patient’s wishes and follow the rules? Trish Pierce, Palm Desert DESERT SUN Valley hospital moves limit patient end of life choices Obama failing in Syria PBS Newshour on Aug. 15 had a graphic video on how Syria’s Bashar al-Assad is now defying the Geneva Convention by deliberately bombing well-marked hospitals in Aleppo, Syria. Someone should send a copy of this video to Barack Obama, our “elected leader of western civilization.” Assad’s direct and indirect killing of Syrian civilians now numbers several hundred thousand and counting. George H.W. Bush patiently assembled an impressive coalition that quashed any potential slaughter in Kuwait. Bill Clinton acted in Bosnia. Just how many of our above-average former presidents would stand by and provide solicitous excuses for his inability to use the United Nations and our many allies to stop this intentional murder of innocents, nurses and doctors in Syria. I feel sorry for Obama’s daughters. To have their father go down in history books, not for the better things that he has done, but rather for the blood stains on his hands for gross inaction during one of the more ruthless, potentially curable holocausts of our times. R. L. Greene, Palm Desert They’re all the same Donald Trump’s sudden admiration for NATO shows how much he and Hillary Clinton agree on foreign policy. Alienating NATO allies for their so-called lack of support for the War on Terrorism makes Trump sound like President Obama because both Trump and Obama have criticized NATO members for not spending enough on defense budgets. With regards to Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama, Trump, Clinton and Bush seem to view NATO members as some sort of party to blame for the United States’ colossal foreign policy blunders. Now, both Trump and Clinton are embracing NATO because they both want to collect as many campaign contributions as possible from weapons manufacturers. They want to make sure Boeing and Northrop Grumman do not lose contracts, especially NATO contacts, to European corporations, like Airbus. Earl Ammerman IV, Palm Springs America, this was inevitable Mr. Trump, the image and manifestation of the modern American citizen in its dilemma, is its own creation, from whence it has expected too much of the world and now the world expects too much of America. Joe Schwarz, Penticton, British Columbia I see bias in the media I have been a daily reader of The Desert Sun since I moved here 14 years ago. Since then I have never seen the newspaper take such a hard left politically as they have since Hillary Clinton began running for president. I think The Desert Sun, USA Today and the media in general are not telling the whole story and doing a huge disservice to the American people. They are always slamming Republicans but never telling the true misdeeds of the Democrats only the things they think won’t hurt them. I don’t think the people who write for the newspaper realize that they are bringing this great country of America down. Frederick A. Dominski, La Quinta It’s not that simple Re: Thomas Sowell column “More on the right are calling out recklessness of Trump,” Aug. 14 Thomas Sowell fills his article with his own supply of reckless rhetoric. He states that “... Hillary Clinton ... will nominate candidates for the Supreme Court who will destroy both the First Amendment ... and the Second Amendment ....” Some ninth-grade student from a civics class should tell the Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution that any changes to the Constitution have to be made by either a Constitutional Convention (and then approved by three-fourths of the state legislatures) or by a Congressional bill passed by two-thirds of both houses (and then approved by the states). He, like Donald Trump, seem to imply that a flick of the pen by the president or the Supreme Court is all that’s needed. Ted Bacino, Palm Springs Smart moves Every American who cares about justice should salute the Department of Justice decision to end the use of private prisons. The comments I have read thus far online are in agreement that there should be no profit motive in the incarceration of human beings. The establishment of such prisons led to the incarceration of millions for victimless crimes. The government should now takes steps to make whole those whose lives have been ruined so profits could be made by corporations in the prison industry. Next we should look at taxpayer dollars being used to fund charter schools, where again the primary goal is making maximum profits. The only way to ensure every child, regardless of neighborhood, gets a well-rounded education is to publicly fund all schools adequately and to pay teachers salaries that compensate them fairly for their grave responsibilities. George Whitaker, Bellevue, Wash. Demand action on climate The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that July was the hottest month in 136 years of record-keeping, and it was also the 15th consecutive month in which global temperature records were broken. Moreover, in June 31 leading U.S. scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Meteorological Society, sent a letter to Congress calling for climate action and stating that climate change impacts in the United States include greater threats of extreme weather events, sea level rise, water scarcity, heat waves, and wildfires. The letter also states that the severity of these impacts “is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades.” This projection is profoundly disquieting when one considers the recent devastating flooding in Louisiana and the drought-fueled wildfire in San Bernardino, California. Seasoned observers in these areas report that they exceed anything they have seen before. Still, Congress doesn’t act. But citizens can create political will. Please call or write your members of Congress today and ask them to support effective legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The current end date for NASA support of the station is 2024, and the agency has confirmed that it has a plan in place to transfer management of the station to a commercial entity around that time. The ISS deorbit date was originally set for 2016, but that was pushed to 2020 recently. Then, the operational mission was extended to 2024. There was speculation that the station could be abandoned at that time in favor or other projects, but NASA might just be turning the keys over to a new owner. The ISS took years to build and continues to be a platform for important scientific research. It’s also a handy place to test new space technologies like the Bigelow expandable module. NASA didn’t say which companies are being considered to take over ISS operations, but Boeing and SpaceX seem like prime candidates. These are the only firms with manned launch vehicles ready to go. The ISS is even getting a docking module to accommodate the SpaceX Dragon v2 and Boeing CST-100. Those vehicles are expected to begin flying people to and from the ISS in 2017. Of course, the fate of the ISS isn’t only up to NASA. The ISS is a collaboration between the space agencies of the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and Europe. All of them have been pouring billions of dollars into the yearly maintenance costs for the station. They might all be happy to be relieved of that financial burden without letting the station go to waste.

The six-hour spacewalk helps the space station transition from the era of Space Shuttle transportation to that of privatized spaceflight. Both astronauts trained for this installation in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab on the ground, going over the sequence of steps to configure the IDA. The adapter was launched to the space station in July onboard one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. During this spacewalk, it was attached to the end of the ISS's second Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2), which had previously been used to dock space shuttles. Installing the IDA is a big step toward making NASA’s Commercial Crew Program a reality. For the program, private companies SpaceX and Boeing are developing spacecraft for NASA that can ferry astronauts back and forth from the ISS. Those vehicles are supposed to carry people to station for the first time in late 2017 and early 2018. And when they do, they’ll automatically dock with the station’s now-installed IDA. But the IDA isn’t limited to just accepting SpaceX and Boeing’s spacecraft. The adapter has been built to the International Docking System Standard — an international standard for spacecraft docks established in 2010. That means any vehicle with a docking port built to this standard could potentially hook up to the station’s IDA in the future.

The source said it would take about two years to re-start the project and make a carrier, thus launches, which were terminated in 2014, may resume not earlier than in 2018. TASS does not have official confirmation of this information. The Sea Launch project, using Zenit rockets for launches from a floating platform in the Pacific Ocean, has been sold, the head of the Roscosmos corporation, Igor Komarov said earlier. "I cannot name the investor or disclose the value of the contract by virtue of certain circumstances. I do hope I will be able to say more by the end of April," Komarov replied to a question. He added that investors in the United States, Europe, China and Australia had been among the bidders. Space expert: Any observation satellites can be used for military purposes According to earlier reports the project, suspended in 2014, may get back to the market of launch services in 2016. At the end of last year (2015) Segey Gugkayev told TASS that the project would join "proactive competition for new contracts in the first quarter of 2016 after the deal with the investor has been structured." Sea Launch is an international project for building and operating a sea-based space rocket complex. For its implementation a same-name company was established back in 1995, with the United States’ Boeing, Russia’s space rocket corporation Energiya, Norway’s ship-building enterprise Kvaerner (currently Aker Solutions) and Ukraine’s design bureau Yuzhnoye and industrial association Yuzhmash acting as co-founders. The Sea Launch company declared bankruptcy in the summer of 2009. Energiya gained the commanding positions in the project after reorganization in 2010.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     NASA Astronauts Successfully Install New Docking Port On International Space Station Posted: Aug 20 2016, 3:36am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Intl. Space Station Twitter Astronauts affix Brand New Docking Port onto the ISS for Commercial Taxis   Some NASA astronauts have affixed a brand new docking port onto the ISS. Private space firms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are making forays into commercial flights into the final frontier. As for the ISS, it is expected to receive much in the way of heavy traffic in the ensuing years. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals Yet, before all this is possible, the ISS must have some parking space to accommodate the spacecraft that happen to find their way to its door. That is why yesterday two NASA astronauts installed a novel docking port on the ISS.  This formally ends the United States’ sole reliance upon the Russians for conveyance to and from the ISS. Two astronauts, Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins, engaged in a spacewalk outside the ISS for the worthy purpose of attaching the first of two docking adapters to it. At the edge of the world installing the Intl. Docking Adapter. Congrats to the teams who made this possible #Exp48 pic.twitter.com/1aWJS2dZPR— NASA Astronauts (@NASA_Astronauts) August 19, 2016 The time this task took was five hours and 58 minutes. The second docking adapter will be sent to be affixed on the ISS next year. Williams happens to be the head of the half a dozen strong crew of the ISS. He has performed spacewalks some four odd times in his tenure as a seasoned astronaut. As for Rubins, this was her first time on a spacewalk, according to Space.com.  When astronauts are in the spacesuit, they use mirrors to see the controls on the front. @cesar_colunga #askNASA 2/2 pic.twitter.com/1B6VRvL8pp— Doug Wheelock (@Astro_Wheels) August 19, 2016 The docking adapter had been constructed thanks to the Boeing Corporation. It took two hours to tie it down close to the ISS. It is one meter in height and 1.6 meters in width. After the installation, the robotic machinery accomplished the rest of the necessary procedure. This operation makes the docking adapter a permanent fixture of the ISS. Data and power lines were assembled by Williams and Rubins too. Sharing will be a possibility thanks to this scheme.  .@Astro_Jeff and #AstroKate concluded 5-hour, 58-minute spacewalk at 2:02 pm ET. https://t.co/DU9q7hEtdn pic.twitter.com/kUp72FDOUU— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 19, 2016 The ISS now has a novel port of call, as it stood stationary over Singapore. This installation marks an important step in the establishment of commercial flights to and from the ISS. The novel adapters will function in synch with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner. This new adapter is a far cry from previous versions. Not only is it much more special in its structural-functional setup, it also opens the doors to automatic parking at the ISS. Rubins and Williams will be performing another spacewalk at the beginning of the month of September. It will be done in order to de-install a solar array cooling panel which has become defunct. Also a TV camera will get installed outside the ISS.     Watch #AstroKate work as Earth passes 250 miles below her. She and @Astro_Jeff are now 5 hours into #spacewalk. https://t.co/6NTnHPJwlL— Intl.

Krisinger Just when U.S. airlines are experiencing an active summer travel season, with four percent more passengers expected than last summer’s banner year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weighs in on the industry. Their recent verdict: “planet-warming pollution produced by airplanes endangers human health by contributing to climate change.” Such is the basis for their “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act, which now triggers the legal requirement to impose the first-ever government regulations of aircraft emissions and extend the EPA’s reach into yet another segment of the U.S. economy. The announced plan to reduce aircraft emissions takes place as President Obama seeks to bolster his climate change legacy with new policies in the last months of his administration. Airline regulation would be among the final pieces of his contentious and sweeping second-term climate agenda, which included his role in last year’s Paris agreement to commit some 200 countries to act to reduce carbon emissions. The EPA takes its lead to restrict and regulate in the name of climate change from those broad administration themes. President Obama declaring the debate settled, “climate change is a fact” -- with that statement’s embedded presumptions of human-caused global warming and necessary exigent actions to avert catastrophic climate disruption -- has already provided the EPA with justification for carte blanche regulatory action in several key sectors of the U.S. economy such as power plants and autos. Similarly, any coming regulation of airline emissions will then adhere to the ddministration’s Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution and be justified with climate change rationale, but – importantly -- imposed without regard for the collective impact of the industry’s operational realities and overall sizable contribution to the nation’s economy. Airlines have long expected such regulatory treatment. “The airline industry is not dragging its feet,” said one industry spokesperson, and to fly more efficiently and reduce emissions, the industry is “already at the edge of feasibility,” said another. Exhaust emissions are but one of many concerns. A modern airliner must also be able to operate safely, make less noise, withstand tremendous weather and aerodynamic forces, have sufficient size to carry many passengers over long distances at high speeds, and dependably fly often with reasonable operating costs -- among other factors. Within those parameters, domestic airlines will carry over 700 million passengers annually, generate revenues near $160 billion, employ nearly 545,000 people, and account for approximately eight percent of annual U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Airlines already understand it is in their own best interests to limit and reduce exhaust emissions irrespective of any government intervention. Quite simply, fuel is expensive to carry and burn. Fuel vies with labor as an airline’s biggest expense and companies work hard to find ways to reduce consumption and improve overall fuel efficiency. Nowadays, airlines are more intent than ever to improve fuel efficiency just to reduce costs imposed by fuel prices that have risen over time. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), new aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient than 40 years ago and 20% better than 10 years ago. Internationally, airlines have adopted a voluntary fuel efficiency goal to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by at least 25% by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, while the U.S. airline industry has set a target of an average annual improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5 percent (and has so far been successful in meeting that goal.) The world’s two largest aircraft makers -- Boeing and Airbus -- recently put into service more fuel-efficient planes -- the B787 and A380 -- designed for long-distance international routes that seek fuel efficiencies rivaling a compact car for moving each passenger a comparable distance. Engine manufacturers, in turn, fairly recently solved reliability issues so airliners can now safely fly long oceanic routes with two engines versus the previous standard of three or four. Fuel efficient high bypass “turbofan” engines are now the norm, replacing earlier less efficient “turbojet” engines. Airlines are also working in other areas to improve fuel efficiency and halt emissions growth. Among them are developing alternative fuels; refining both airport ground and flight operations; better managing air traffic; and grounding and retiring older, less fuel efficient aircraft. Pilots are also trained and directed to fly flight profiles that maximize fuel efficiency. Fuel loads for each route are precisely calculated because of costs to carry unneeded fuel, while airlines carefully monitor excess seat capacity so as to load more people on fewer flights. Why then should the EPA, with its regulatory mindset locked on climate change and egged on by hard-core environmentalists, potentially impose costly and crippling regulations without objective consideration of airlines’ operational realities and efforts?  That question is even more compelling for an industry that has proven capable of acting responsibly without unwarranted government intervention and holds ample monetary incentives to cut fuel consumption -- and thus emissions -- on its own. Government regulation of any industry, like what the EPA has in mind for the airlines, should not -- pun intended -- “fly” in Washington.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from Phys.Org: With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two U.S. astronauts embarked on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power at 8:04 (1204 GMT) and floated outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching the first of two international docking adaptors. The spacewalkers finished the task in just over two hours. "With that, we have a new port of call," said NASA commentator Rob Navias, as the space station flew over Singapore at 10:40 am (1440 GMT). NASA describes the docking adaptor as a "metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of U.S. spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The second docking adaptor is expected to be installed in 2018. Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts. boeing business iss ← Related Links → Marijuana Provides More Pain Relief For Men Than Woman, Says Study SpaceX Intends To Send a Red Dragon To Mars As Early As 2018 Astronauts Won't Be Flying To Space In Boeing's Starliner Until 2018 How President Jimmy Carter Saved The Space Shuttle Submission: 'New Port of Call' Installed At Space Station Fedora 25 To Run Wayland By Default Instead Of X.Org Server This discussion has been archived.

Photo Credit: Carleton Bailie / SpaceFlight Insider CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., — The first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that successfully launched the Japanese JCSAT-16 satellite into orbit on Aug. 14 was brought into Port Canaveral four days later, Aug. 18, aboard the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You. Photo Credit: Carleton Bailie / SpaceFlight Insider The rocket stage had successfully landed on the drone ship approximately 400 miles (640 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean after blasting its way out of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station some nine minutes prior. After arriving in Port, the stage was unloaded by a crane and moved to a nearby stand where the rocket will be made safe for transportation to SpaceX’s Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) near launch pad 39A. There it will undergo inspections. According to Space.com, SpaceX may re-use one of its flown stages as soon as this fall. Meanwhile, preparations are underway for the company’s next mission. SpaceX is set to launch the Amos-6 satellite Sept. 3 from Cape Canaveral. This satellite will provide broadband coverage to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and is being launched to replace the aging Amos-2. The booster for the Amos-6 mission was recently static fired at SpaceX’s test facility in McGregor, Texas, and was expected to begin its road trip to Cape Canaveral this week. Despite flooding along the route usually taken in transit, the rocket is expected to arrive with plenty of time for its scheduled launch date. In orbit, the CRS-9 Dragon is nearing the end of its mission berthed to the International Space Station (ISS). One of the most important pieces of hardware delivered by CRS-9 was the first of two International Docking Adapters. They will be used for commercial crew flights by SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner. Dragon is expected to be unberthed and deorbited on Aug. 26. It will splashdown off the coast of Baja California to be recovered. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, the International Docking Adapter 2 (IDA-2) was removed from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk using the Dextre robot. Two days later, Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins successfully installed the adapter during a five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk.

It was attached to the forward end of the outpost Aug. 19 by astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins during EVA-36. Photo Credit: Cory Huston / NASA Two members of the International Space Station’s Expedition 48 crew stepped outside the orbital complex to install a new “front porch”. The nearly six-hour long spacewalk started at 7:04 a.m. CDT (12:04 GMT) Aug. 19 with a goal to install International Docking Adapter-2 (IDA-2) to the forward end of the station. NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins, commander and flight engineer, respectively, each tag-teamed to install IDA-2 as the primary task of the mission. The adapter was brought to the space station by way of SpaceX‘s CRS-9 Dragon. It has remained inside the trunk since arriving at the outpost one month ago.

Williams was on his fourth spacewalk while Rubins was on her first. Williams was the lead spacewalker, EV-1, with red stripes on his suit and Rubins was EV-2 with white stripes. Back on Wednesday, ground teams controlled the station’s robotic Canadarm2 with the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (Dextre) robotic “hand” attached to the end of the arm. The arm used Dextre to grab the IDA-2, located inside Dragon’s trunk, and carefully pull it out. IDA-2 was moved to within a few feet (about a meter) in front of PMA-2 where it stayed for more than a day. Then, a few hours before the spacewalk, it was moved to make contact with the docking ring. When Williams and Rubins arrived at the work location, they began attaching power and data cables that were run across the station in the last year over four separate spacewalks spanning multiple expedition crews. Additionally, special adjustable tethers were attached to secure IDA-2 with PMA-2. After confirming the adapter was firmly attached via the tethers, ground teams detached and slowly moved Dextre away. Once that task was completed, inside ISS, Flight Engineer and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi used a special IDA control panel to command the latches on IDA-2 to engage into PMA-2. After a firm connection was established, the crew mated a few more cables and installed reflectors. Finally, the cover in front of IDA-2 was removed, revealing the docking petals to space – this officially made IDA-2 ready to receive commercial vehicles. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” Williams said not long after official confirmation of mating had occurred. “Congratulations to the entire team.” The next task the spacewalkers completed included the running of even more cables to prepare for IDA-3 to be installed, currently expected sometime in 2018. Additional tasks for EVA-36 included running power and data cables for a future Russian module addition to the ISS – Nauka – currently scheduled for sometime in late 2017. After that had been completed, there was time for the duo to perform a couple of get-ahead tasks. First was to reconfigure a CETA cart brake handle and the second was to conduct a photo survey of a side of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer that the station’s external cameras cannot see. Williams reports losing audio on his right earpiece in his Comm Cap on his head. Photo Credit: NASA TV However, sometime into the fifth hour of the spacewalk, Williams lost audio in his right ear. Fears that the water-in-the-helmet issue might crop up again, he was commanded to check his helmet absorption pad (HAP). It remained dry, so water buildup was not believed to causing the audio problem. While everything was well within safety margins, Mission Control in Houston recommended ending the EVA early. As such, the two get-ahead tasks were not completed. In total, between switching on to battery power (marking the official start of the spacewalk) to connecting their suits to power and cooling ports at 1:02 p.m. CDT (18:02 GMT) inside the airlock after returning (marking the end of the spacewalk), the duration of the EVA was five hours and 58 minutes. After closing the airlock and pressurizing the crew compartment, the astronauts were helped out of their suits by their crewmates inside the space station. Once back inside, the right earpiece on the Comm cap was found to be a bit wet when touched. It will be bagged for analysis at a later date in order to test its functionality. It will not be used for the next spacewalk, EVA-37, scheduled for Sept. 1. Today’s walk was the 194th EVA in support of ISS assembly and maintenance – totaling 1,210 hours and 46 minutes. To put that into perspective, that is also 50 days, 10 hours and 46 minutes. Preparation for this EVA spanned multiples years. Originally, the spacewalk was supposed to take place last summer. However, a launch mishap in June 2015 destroyed the CRS-7 Dragon capsule carrying IDA-1. This current adapter, IDA-2, was the second to be built. A third is currently being manufactured by Boeing as a replacement for IDA-1 utilizing spare parts. Both will be used to support the Commercial Crew Program when SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing‘s CST-100 Starliner when they start flying. The reason these adapters were manufactured was that a new International Docking System Standard (IDSS) was developed. The design utilizes low-impact technologies and allows for both docking and berthing. Additionally, it can support either autonomous or piloted dockings. It adapts the current Russian-designed APAS-95-based system that was used during the Space Shuttle era. IDSS is not compatible with the old system, so the IDA converts the port to the new NASA docking standard, which is the agency’s implementation of the IDSS. Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation (with their Dream Chaser Cargo System) plan to utilize the IDSS for their crew and cargo vehicles.

He is currently the managing editor of the student run newspaper, the Washburn Review. He also writes a blog, called Orbital Velocity, about the space station. His passion for space ignited when he watched space shuttle Discovery leap to space on Oct. 29, 1998. He saw his first in-person launch on July 8, 2011 when the space shuttle launched for the final time. Today, this fervor has accelerated toward orbit and shows no signs of slowing down. After dabbling in math and engineering courses in college, he soon realized that his true calling was communicating to others about space exploration and spreading that passion. Related Reading Reader Comments JS August 22, 2016 9:21 am Great article! But please watch the typos — you introduce Kate Rubins as “Kate Williams” and then later describe her spacesuit as having “white strips” instead of stripes. These errors add confusion and slow down comprehension for your readers. Reply Jeff Findley August 22, 2016 10:58 am Congrats to NASA on the successful EVA! Minor gripe. The astronauts aren’t going to sit on it in rocking chairs and sip iced tea. It’s a docking port not a ‘front porch’. I hate it when the NASA public affairs people give space hardware “common” names like this. Reply ⚠ Commenting Rules Post Comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Companies like SpaceX and Boeing already run the commercial missions to resupply the station, and they'll start carrying crew in 2017. They seem well-positioned to take advantage, even if it's not clear yet what the private companies would do with their own orbiting lab. In the meantime, other space firms are invested enough to want to improve the existing station. NanoRacks wants to add a private airlock to the ISS to launch its tiny satellites called cubesats.

Stacy M. Brown, NNPA News Wire Contributor Leave a comment 42 reads  In this June 9, 2015 file photo, construction continues on The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.  (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/File) Sponsorships and donations have been pouring into the new Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), which is set to open on Sept. 24 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Most recently, the popular 1990s R&B group En Vogue donated their performance-worn dresses to the museum. “Our dresses from the ‘Never Gonna Get It/My Lovin’ video and the ‘Giving Him Something He Can Feel’ video will be debuting in the Smithsonian African American History museum on September 24,” group member Terry Ellis said. “So, we’re really super excited about that.” NBA Icon Michael Jordan also announced this month that he was providing a $5 million gift to the museum along with his game-worn 1996 NBA Finals jersey. The museum will reportedly place the famous jersey in a wing called “Michael Jordan Hall,” that will feature stories of 17 historic athletes. In a news release, Jordan noted athletes like Jesse Owens whose “talent, commitment and perseverance broke racial barriers and laid the groundwork for the successful careers of so many African-Americans in athletics and beyond.” Also, in a statement, museum director Lonnie G. Bunch III said Jordan’s contribution will enable museum “visitors to explore how sports were used to break barriers as a way to gain full participation in American society.” The National Museum of African American History and Culture officially opens to the public following the dedication ceremony on Saturday, September 24, 2016. The museum keeps its doors open for extended hours Sunday, September 25, from 10 am to 10pm. The National Museum of African American History and Culture is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African-American life, history, and culture. It was established by an Act of Congress in 2003, following decades of efforts to promote and highlight the contributions of African-Americans, according to the museum’s website. To date, the museum has collected more than 36,000 artifacts. Nearly 100,000 individuals have become charter members of the museum and, when it opens, it will be the 19th and newest museum of the Smithsonian Institution. Museum officials noted the four pillars upon which the NMAAHC stands: It provides an opportunity for those who are interested in African-American culture to explore and revel in this history through interactive exhibitions; It helps all Americans see how their stories, their histories, and their cultures are shaped and informed by global influences; It explores what it means to be an American and share how American values like resiliency, optimism, and spirituality are reflected in African-American history and culture; and it serves as a place of collaboration that reaches beyond Washington, D.C., to engage new audiences and to collaborate with the myriad of museums and educational institutions that have explored and preserved this important history well before this museum was created. Earlier this year, The Hartford, a popular financial services company, announced its founding sponsorship of the museum. The company made a $1 million contribution over five years to support the design and construction of the building. “The Hartford has been a part of American history for more than 200 years, growing, thriving and changing along with our nation,” said Susan Johnson, head of diversity and inclusion at The Hartford. “We are proud to be a founding sponsor of the National Museum of African American History and Culture and celebrate the important contributions of African Americans to the American Dream.” On Feb. 22, 2012, the Smithsonian broke ground on the NMAAHC at a five-acre site on Constitution Avenue between 14th and 15th streets in Northwest Washington, D.C. The 400,000-square-foot building has five levels above ground and four below. It will have exhibition galleries, an education center, a theater, café and store as well as staff offices. Pinnacle donors – those who have contributed $20 million or more – include the Lilly Endowment Inc., Robert Frederick Smith, and the Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation. Capstone donors – those who have contributed at least $10 million – include the Atlantic Philanthropies, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Rhimes Family Foundation and David M. Rubenstein. Cornerstone donors – those who have contributed at least $5 million – include 3M, American Express, The Boeing Company, Ford Foundation, GE, Robert L. Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, The Rockefeller Foundation, Target, United Health Group, and Walmart. Keystone Donors – those who have contributed at least $2 million – include 21st Century Fox and News Corp, Bank of America, The Walt Disney Company, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Kovler Foundation, Medtronic Foundation, The Moore Charitable Foundation/Louis Moore Bacon, Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Northrop Grumman, Prudential, Smithsonian Channel, Earl W. and Amanda Stafford, Patty Stonesifer and Michael Kinsley, Time Warner Foundation, Toyota, United Technologies Corporation, Walton Family Foundation, Anthony and Beatrice Welters and the Vincent Wilkinson Foundation. Verizon, Xerox, Wells Fargo, Google, Tyler Perry, New York Life, MetLife Foundation, Fed Ex, Ford Motor Company Fund, General Motors and a host of others have donated at least $1 million, making them “milestone donors.” “After more than a decade of hard work and dedication on the part of so many, we will open the doors of the museum and let visitors see that it is a place for all people,” Bunch said in an earlier statement. Bunch continued: “We have created exhibitions and programs designed to unite and capture the attention of millions of people worldwide. It will be a place for healing and reconciliation, a place where everyone can explore the story of America through the lens of the African American experience.” The National Museum of African American History and Culture officially opens to the public following the dedication ceremony on Saturday, September 24, 2016. The museum keeps its doors open for extended hours Sunday, September 25, from 10 am to 10pm. Also On Atlanta Daily World: comments – Add Yours DIGITAL EDITION!

(NASA/Bill Ingalls/Handout via Reuters) WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. astronauts on Friday ventured out of the International Space Station and successfully installed the first of two crucial docking ports that will enable future arrivals of American commercial crew spacecraft. Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins from the U.S. space agency NASA concluded their spacewalk at 2:02 p.m. EDT (1802 GMT) after spending nearly six hours installing the ring-like equipment, known as an international docking adapter (IDA). It's "a significant milestone in NASA's work to return crew launches to U.S. soil," the agency said in a statement. Since NASA retired its space shuttle program in 2011, the only vehicle to ferry humans to the space station is Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. NASA created the commercial crew program in the hope of ending the U.S. reliance on Russia. It has awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build commercial spaceships, with their first flights slated for 2017. The IDA arrived at the space station July 20 on a SpaceX Dragon cargo resupply spacecraft. It's a ring weighing more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg) that will provide a standardized connection point for Boeing and SpaceX crew spacecraft to automatically dock with the station. Another IDA was expected to be launched in 2018. This is the fourth spacewalk in Williams' career and the first for Rubins. It is the 194th spacewalk for the space station.

Commenting on what he sees as an explicit escalation of "anti-Russian rhetoric in the US presidential campaign," The Intercept contributor Lee Fang wrote that it's coming "in the midst of a major push by military contractors to position Moscow as a potent enemy," one "that must be countered with a drastic increase in military spending by NATO countries." Unfortunately, it's working, the journalist added. Specifically, "the arms industry – both directly and through its arsenal of hired-gun, think-tank experts and lobbyists – is actively pressuring NATO member nations to hike defense spending in line with the NATO goal for member states to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense." © AFP 2016/ ANDREW COWIE The Growth Industry That is Anti-Russian PropagandaAt the same time, the US military-industrial complex has been "posturing" itself for an uptick in spending  over the Western-Russian crisis that began over Ukraine two years ago, in spite of very modest increases in Russian defense spending, which remains dwarfed by that of the US and its NATO allies. Furthermore, Fang recalled that many experts remain "unconvinced that Russia poses a direct military threat. The Soviet Union's military once stood at over 4 million soldiers, but today Russia has less than 1 million." Meanwhile, "NATO's combined military budget vastly outranks Russia's – with the US alone outspending Russia on its military by $609 billion to less than $85 billion." "And yet, the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobby group for Lockheed Martin, Textron, Raytheon, and other defense contractors, argued in February that the Pentagon is not spending enough to counter 'Russian aggression on NATO's Doorstep'. Think tanks with major funding from defense contractors, including the Lexington Institute and the Atlantic Council, have similarly demanded higher defense spending to counter Russia." These groups aren't limiting their hopes to contracts from the US military, either, and argue for everything from providing lethal aid to Kiev for its war against the rebellious eastern regions, to the granting of lucrative contracts to US allies in Eastern Europe in their efforts beef up their capabilities against Russia. Nor are the contracts limited to conventional weapons, with lobbyists, officials and pro-arms industry media successfully advancing projects such as the Aegis Ashore missile defense installation in Poland (a contract recently awarded to Lockheed Martin), along with new shipbuilding, fighter jet and anti-tank weapons elsewhere. © AFP 2016/ BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI Boeing Ready to Design Next Generation of US Nuclear MissilesSpeaking to The Intercept, William Hartung, director of the Arms & Security Project at the Washington-based Center for International Policy, noted that "companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have pledged to increase the share of exports in their overall revenues, and they have been seeking major deals in East and Central Europe since the 1990s, when NATO expansion began." Now, as rhetoric about the 'Russian threat' intensifies, these companies are "knocking at the door, looking to sell [countries] everything from fighter planes to missile defense systems." At home in the US, the growing conflict with Moscow "has additional benefits," the analyst noted, "because it has become a standard part of the argument for higher Pentagon spending –even though the Pentagon already has more than enough money to address any actual threat to the United States." ...

During a spacewalk of 5 hours and 58 minutes on Friday, astronauts Jeff Williams, Commander of the 48th expedition and flight engineer Kate Rubins, fixed the first two points of the International Docking Adapter (IDA), EFE news reported. The IDA's will be used for future arrivals of manned commercial aircraft from Boeing and SpaceX, developed under the NASA manned commercial programme, the agency said in a statement. The installation will give NASA an independent access to the ISS for the first time since the withdrawal of its fleet of space shuttles in 2011. So far, NASA depends on the Russian Soyuz vessels. Jeff Williams said in a statement that the IDA has opened a new chapter in the history of the ISS enabling the access for future commercial vehicles. The new docking mechanism was transported in June to the ISS aboard a Dragon capsule by California-based private firm SpaceX, after the first IDA was lost during the launch failure of a SpaceX flight in June 2015. According to NASA, commercial flights from Florida to the ISS will increase the time for US crews to devote to scientific research and help prepare astronauts for deeper space missions, including possible travel to Mars. --IANS ss/ksk/vm SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.
