The president-elect left Trump Tower in New York on Thursday morning for LaGuardia Airport, escorted by ambulances and a large convoy of SUVs and motorbikes. He climbed on board a United States Air Force (USAF) Boeing C-32A at LaGuardia and traveled to Washington with members of his family, including his five children, CBS News reports. The USAF Boeing C-32A landed at Joint Base Andrews shortly after noon. Trump’s children and their families exited first. The first member of the family to exit the plane was Trump’s 10-year-old son, Barron, followed by Kai, the oldest daughter of Donald Trump, Jr. Donald, Jr. and his wife, Vanessa, followed, accompanied by their other children. Eric Trump and his wife, Lara, exited next. Eric and Lara were followed by Ivanka Trump, carrying her son, Theodore. Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, and their other children followed. Trump has appointed Kushner as his senior White House adviser.

It's really happening: Donald Trump has arrived in Washington DC https://t.co/vGwM3pcKLc pic.twitter.com/iZMVA15sDj — Independent US (@IndyUSA) January 19, 2017 Soon after arriving in Washington, Trump posted to Instragram a photo taken as he exited the plane. “Just landed with Melania; my family. Thank you for all of your support. I love you – and We will Make America great again.” His son Donald, Jr. also posted a photo to Instagram showing him and his family exiting the plane. “And we are in DC. Pretty surreal experience so far.” Ivanka too posted a photo of herself and her family. “Arriving in Washington DC with my family. A very special moment! #MAGA #Inauguration2017” After leaving Joint Base Andrews, Trump went straight to his Washington, D.C., hotel to attend a luncheon with GOP members of Congress. At the luncheon, he invited his wife, Melania, to the podium to make a few remarks.

After the address, he attended a welcome concert on the steps of the landmark. The concert ended with fireworks. Trump will start the day on Friday with a church service. After the service, he and his wife will drive to the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to meet the outgoing president, Barack Obama, and first lady Michelle. Trump and Obama will then ride together along Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol where Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts. Mike Pence will be sworn in by Justice Clarence Thomas. After the swearing-in ceremony, Trump will deliver his inaugural address. It is expected that 900,000 people will be in Washington, D.C., to witness the historic event.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Question: Is over-reliance on automation increasing the number of commercial airline accidents? Answer: No, the number of accidents is decreasing. Over-reliance on automation has become a factor in a larger percentage of accidents, but the overall number is trending downward. The appropriate use of automation and maintaining manual flying skills are focus items for aviation. Training has to include extensive use of automation and manual flying.  Alexander Hassenstein, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Can a larger aircraft land on a shorter than recommended runway in an emergency? Answer: Yes, it can be done. Every airplane has a required runway length due to the physics of decelerating. It is much shorter than many people realize. When landing on very short runways, the pilots will very carefully control the speed, touch down on the touchdown point and use all of the deceleration devices (brakes, spoilers and reverse thrust).  Rob Griffith, AP Fullscreen Question: Where does my bag go when I check it? Answer: From the time a bag is checked in, a series of belts and carts transport it to the waiting airplane. If your airplane is a larger one, the bag will be loaded into a container to make it faster to load onto the airplane. Security screening of the bag occurs before loading to ensure the safety of the flight. When the loading begins, it is sent up via belt loader or in the container into the cargo hold where it is kept warm (sort of) and pressurized during the fight. At your destination, the reverse occurs. The belt loader or container loader takes the bag to a cart where it is sent to the terminal to meet you.  Patrick Semansky, AP Fullscreen Question: When the announcement is made that, "The pilot has begun his initial approach," why is the word initial used? It implies there may be more than one approach. Answer: It is a differentiation of the segments of the approach. There is an initial part of the approach and a final phase of the approach. The final phase is often the last 5 miles when the airplane is aligned with the runway and is descending toward it.  Justin Tallis, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Why do airlines on domestic flights carry life vests, with all the extra weight that entails? Answer: Airplanes often fly domestic and overwater flights in the same day. It is not uncommon for an airplane to fly several domestic flights, then fly to Bermuda or the Caribbean. Returning from the overwater flights, it then flies other domestic legs. One of the NTSB recommendations from the accident in the Hudson was to have all airliners have life vests available for passengers due to the large number of lakes and other bodies of water over which airplanes fly.  Edouard H. R. Gluck, AP Fullscreen Question: Right after takeoff, it often seems that the pilot slows down and the plane drops somewhat. Why is that? Answer: The sensation of slowing down is really one of slowing the rate of acceleration; this is due to reducing the thrust after takeoff to the climb setting. The sensation of “dropping” comes from the retraction of the flaps and slats. The rate of climb is reduced, causing it to feel like a descent.  Josep Lago, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Can you explain all the different lights on a commercial aircraft and their purpose? Answer: Lights vary on airplanes, but all have red and green lights on the wing tip, and a white light visible from behind (it can be on the tail or aft part of the wing tip). Additionally there are landing lights to provide illumination of the runway during landing. A taxi light provides a lower-power light to see taxiways; the taxi light can be supplemented by special lights to help make sharp turns. There are often lights that illuminate the wings so the pilots can inspect for ice build-up. The red flashing lights on the top and bottom are known as anti-collision lights. Many airplanes have bright flashing white lights called strobes making them easier to see.  Comstock/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: How bad does turbulence have to be before we should be freaking out?? Answer: Unexpected turbulence is uncomfortable, but is not a safety risk to the airplane. Airplanes are designed for it. The last case of a turbulence-caused accident was in the 1960s in Japan. There are some similarities with a boat hitting a wave in water. One difference is that the airplane may experience more vertical displacement, making it feel more severe. Most humans do not like the sensation of negative Gs, which you feel when the airplane drops suddenly. That sensation is caused by the vestibular system in your ears. In everyday life we do not experience negative Gs often, making the sensation unusual and scary to some people. This is a normal reaction. Pilots have experienced this sensation many times and have no problem flying the airplane safely.  Christophe Testi, Getty Images/Hemera Fullscreen Question: How were airport codes assigned? Answer: There are two different types of airport codes: the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). ICAO uses a four-letter code, in which the first letter is the country code. The USA uses K for its code. The New York airports are KJFK for Kennedy, KLGA for LaGuardia and KEWR for Newark. These codes are used for the filing of flight plans and for air traffic control purposes. The IATA codes are used for ticketing and are three letters. Chicago O'Hare is ORD, London Heathrow is LHR, and London Gatwick is LGW. The IATA codes are used for baggage, too.  Jason Kempin, Getty Images for #TackleEbola Fullscreen Question: Why is there sometimes no window next to my seat? Answer: When jets are certified, one consideration is the consequence of a catastrophic engine failure, where rotating engine components are not contained within the cowling. In the very rare event of uncontained parts puncturing through the cowling, it is possible that they could strike a window, causing damage and decompression. This area is strengthened, and the area where the window would normally be is solid.  Jeremy Martin via AP Fullscreen Question: Do airplanes have a hard time taking off in hot weather? Answer: I would not say they have a hard time, but performance is definitely limited by the heat. Hot air does not allow the wing to create as much lift (fewer air molecules); therefore, the weight must be reduced to maintain the required climb path. Very high temperatures such as Arizona, the Middle East or other desert environments require careful preflight planning.  Rob Schumacher, The Arizona Republic Fullscreen Question: Is it safer to be on a smaller plane or larger one? Answer: It is not possible to make a safety differentiation between small or large airplanes because the terms are vague. Regional airline-size airplanes have a somewhat higher accident rate than do larger airline jets. Turboprops have a higher accident rate than jets. Airline jets have some models having lower accident rates than others, but size is not the determining factor. Aviation is the safest form of transportation. This makes it very hard to say that one airplane is significantly safer than another. They are both safe — even if one type has a slightly higher accident rate, that rate is still infinitesimal.  Mark Wilson, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: How long will supplemental oxygen last after the masks drop in an emergency? Answer: On typical airliners oxygen generators will last 10 to 14 minutes. That is more than enough time to descend to 10,000 feet or the lowest altitude above the terrain. Airplanes can descend very rapidly, which means the need for supplemental oxygen lasts only a few minutes. Getty Images  Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Why does it take so long to open the exit door? Answer: Once the airplane arrives at the gate and is properly chocked, the captain shuts down the engines and switches off the “Fasten Seat Belt” light. The anti-collision light (this is the red blinking light on the top and bottom of the airplane) is switched off, informing ground crew that it is safe to approach the airplane. Ground crew members then begin to position the jet bridge, aligning it with the door. Once the jet bridge is mated to the aircraft and the cover is in place, the ground agent either opens the door or taps on it for the flight attendant to open it. Once the door is initially opened, the ground agent assists in fully opening it and ensuring that it is locked in the open position. This is the generic procedure for most jet airliners. Regional or smaller airplanes have a slightly different procedure as their stairs are built into the door.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Question: How do runways get their names? Answer: The runway number is the approximate magnetic heading. As an example, runway 35 is pointing approximately 350 degrees magnetic. The opposite end of the runway is 17 or approximately 170 degrees magnetic. When there are two parallel runways pointing in the same direction, they are designated with the proper number and a left or right identifier. Two runways pointed east are named 09 Left and 09 Right. The 09 indicate they are pointed 090, due east, and the left and right identify the parallels. When there are three runways, they use the same process but include a “Center” designation. If there are four runways or more, the airport will change one of the runway numbers to help differentiate them. As an example, the north runways pointed to the southwest at LAX are named 24 Left and Right, while the south runways are named 25 Left and Right. The runways point in the same direction but the difference allows pilots to know which runway to use.  Digital Vision/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: What efforts are being employed to ensure computer hacking doesn't negatively influence modern aviation from the ground or while in flight? Answer: Computer security is taken very seriously. Airplane flight control and flight management computers are segregated and hardened against outside intrusions. It is possible a hacker might interfere with an in-flight entertainment system, but those and the onboard wireless system have separate pathways from the flight computers. Improving security is an ongoing effort by manufacturers, operators and the regulators.  Mario Tama, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Why is shipping lithium-ion batteries considered dangerous, yet almost all passengers have cellphones with them? What's the difference? Answer: A lithium battery installed in a device is less likely to enter thermal runaway and, if it does, there are few batteries nearby to be driven into thermal runaway. Shipping lithium batteries on passenger aircraft poses a risk that is higher than many operators find acceptable because of the rapid expansion of a fire when lithium batteries enter thermal runaway.  FAA via AP Fullscreen Question: Are there routes over the continental U.S. that tend to experience more turbulence than others? Answer: In some conditions when there are high surface winds, crossing the Rocky Mountains can be turbulent. The mountain waves this condition creates are more pronounced around larger mountains, making the airways crossing them more turbulent.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Question: Does it matter how old a plane is? Answer: If an older airplane is properly maintained, it is safe. The age is not a factor; it is the quality of maintenance that matters.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Question: Why don’t airplanes have external cameras for the pilots to use when taxiing or parking to better guide the plane? Answer: Some of the larger airplanes (e.g. Airbus A340 and A380, and the Boeing 747-8) have cameras to help assist the pilots on taxiways and at gates. Smaller airplanes (e.g. B737 and A320) do not need them as the flight crew can see the wingtips. The widebody airplanes that do not have cameras installed by the manufacturer require careful positioning by the captain during taxiing and parking. It has not been cost-effective to retrofit these airplanes with cameras.  Jasper Colt, USA TODAY Fullscreen Question: When an aircraft is descending toward landing, it seems some planes fly down nose pointed downward, and some seem to float down with the nose pointed up. Is this true, and if so, why the difference? Answer: When configured for landing, the position of the nose is determined by whether there are leading edge slats installed. Airplanes with leading edge slats (movable panels on the front of the wing) approach the runway with the nose up, while airplanes without slats approach with the nose down.  Mario Tama, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Have you ever gotten lost at an airport, considering the congested nature of some U.S. airports? Answer: Taxiing, particularly at a large airport in limited visibility at night, can be very challenging. Many of the modern airliners have electronic maps with the position of the airplane displayed, which really helps. Those that do not have electronic displays require the crew to have taxi charts out and to agree on the taxi clearance and actual route. I have never been lost but have taxied slowly and been very careful to follow the taxi clearance, using input from the first officer.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Question: How do commercial airliners and military aircraft share the skies? Answer: Air traffic control does a great job of keeping airplanes separated, be they commercial, private or military. In addition, the military branches have special airspace they can use for training and maneuvers.  Ian Hitchcock, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: How could a plane land at the wrong airport? Answer: There are several contributing reasons: Humans often see what they expect to see, even when it is wrong. This is known as confirmation bias and contributes to the pilot believing it is the correct airport and runway when it is not. Two pilots and rigorous crosschecking with navigation displays normally break the confirmation bias early. Fatigue can also be a factor, as performance degradation can make it more difficult to recognize the mistake. Modern airplanes have many wonderful navigation tools helping to avoid such events.  Brett Deering, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: How do flight planners determine which aircraft to use on what route? Answer: Airlines have route-planning specialists to ensure that the right-size airplane is used for the route, that any maintenance considerations are taken into account, and that airplanes arrive at the proper location for inspections and service at the proper intervals. It is an art to keep the schedule running. The scheduling professionals learn the job after years of airline experience and are vital to smooth operations.  Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: In freezing conditions, with ice on the runway, how safe is the anti-skid braking system on a modern jet? Answer: The modern jet’s anti-skid system is very good. I have landed on ice-covered runways many times using the anti-skid system to safely stop the airplane. Pilots listen carefully to other landing airplanes for descriptions of the stopping ability on the runway. Runway conditions can change quickly, requiring judgment and experience by the pilot to determine whether it is safe to proceed. This system has worked very well for many decades to ensure the safety of landing aircraft.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Question: I'm amazed at how the pilots steer their plane so effectively while taxiing and then stay centered on the runway's center line. How are these procedures done? Answer: Pilots keep the airplane centered on the runway using a combination of nose-wheel steering and rudder. From very basic flight training, it is a skill that is taught and evaluated frequently. It is critical to keep the airplane aligned with the center line. Some airplanes are easier than others, but a pilot is expected to master it before being released to fly. Pilots watch for drift during takeoff roll and apply rudder with the rudder pedals. On some airplanes at lower speeds it may be necessary to add a bit of nose-wheel steering to achieve the desired track.  Rob Schumacher, The Arizona Republic Fullscreen Question: How does a pilot land a plane during heavy rain and low visibility? Answer: Pilots use precise navigation equipment, usually the Instrument Landing System (ILS), to maneuver the airplane laterally and vertically to land on the runway. If an ILS is not available, GPS or other navigation aids are used. A high-quality ILS combined with special equipment onboard can allow pilots to safely land when the visibility is very limited.  Nelson Almeida, AFP/Getty Images Fullscreen Question: Do airline pilots need a college degree? Answer: Pilots have varied backgrounds; most are college graduates, and many have master's degrees or PhDs. It is more important to be able to learn the material, understand it and properly apply it than to have a specific level of education.  Joe Raedle, Getty Images Fullscreen Question: What do the in-flight chimes mean? Answer: Different airlines use the chimes differently. Here are some uses I've witnessed in my career: A single chime could be to the flight attendants to advise them of pending choppy air, perhaps serious enough that they should be seated. Another possibility would be, "when you have time, could we please have a coffee?" Two chimes are often used to indicate the aircraft is approaching 10,000 feet in altitude. Three or more chimes could be to tell the flight attendants to be seated NOW due to reports of turbulence that were just received by the pilots. Cabin crew can also use the chimes to communicate with the flight deck. A single chime could be, "would you like coffee?" Three or more chimes to the flight deck could be, "we have a passenger with a medical problem that could require a diversion."  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Like this topic?

(Photo: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY) Q: Recently, it has been rumored that some airlines are considering using the Airbus A321-LR for trans-Atlantic flights. Do you think narrow-body aircraft will be the future for international travel? Will that open up international travel for budget airlines? — Submitted by reader Korey, New York A: It is possible that several airlines could begin flying A321LRs on trans-Atlantic routes. The airplane has the range to make the flight.  The Boeing 757 has been used on less-traveled trans-Atlantic routes for many years. Both are single-aisle airplanes, also known as narrow-body aircraft. As the service to secondary cities continues to increase, the ability to fly non-stop instead of connecting in a hub to a wide-body aircraft will be very appealing.  The planes will not replace the wide-body aircraft flown between the large cities. There is growing discussion about low-cost trans-Atlantic airline service. In the past, it was not successful; however, there are several budget international airlines entering the market or interested in doing so. USA TODAY Is JetBlue ready for flights to Europe? Q: Emirates Airlines is soon to launch the longest commercial flight, Dubai to Panama, using a B777-200LR, a twin-engine aircraft. This flight must cross the Atlantic Ocean, and I don’t see any crossing point of less than six hours. Aren’t twin-engine regulations being violated on this flight? — Daniel Wambisa, Nairobi, Kenya A: Airplanes such as the B777 have been granted extended operations authority, allowing them to fly such routes. They are not in violation of the regulations. The system redundancy of the modern twin jets such as the 777, 787 and A350 are remarkable, allowing them to fly over very remote parts of the planet safely. USA TODAY Ask the Captain: Flying over remote oceans Q: If a twin-engine plane has one engine that fails midway over the Atlantic, what options do the pilots have? — S. Reginald Pratt, Monrovia, Liberia A: The pilots will divert to the nearest suitable airport. On overwater flights, the en route diversion airports are planned before departure. If there is a need to divert — for an engine problem or any other issue (e.g. passenger medical, weather) — the pilots have the plan in place. Q: Regarding the Dreamliner that landed and took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport: Wouldn’t it be a game changer to fly from DCA to LHR?       — Gabriel, Norfolk, Va. A: A Boeing 787 has landed at Reagan Washington National Airport. However, it was a demonstration flight and not a commercial one. Considering the runway length, capacity control and distance limits on flights from DCA, I do not think there will be any trans-Atlantic flight from there in the foreseeable future.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Jan 22, 2017 at 11:20AM Historically, commercial jet orders have been sharply cyclical, with boom times followed by big busts. In the past year or two, order activity has slowed significantly at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY), indicating that the current cycle is past its peak. Order activity for the Boeing 737 has slowed in the past two years. Image source: The Motley Fool. This order slowdown has made many analysts skeptical that Boeing and Airbus will be able to implement planned production increases for their 737 and A320 narrowbody jet families. This isn't a very realistic concern. With unprecedented narrowbody order backlogs, Boeing and Airbus remain well positioned to go ahead with plans to raise production aggressively in the next few years. Order activity slows, but backlogs remain massive Between 2011 and 2015, Airbus averaged more than 1,000 net orders per year for its popular A320-series planes. During that period, it was building less than half that number on an annual basis. Order activity declined in 2016, but Airbus still managed to secure more than 600 net orders for the A320 family (including the new A320neo series). As a result, Airbus ended 2016 with a record backlog of 5,645 A320-family jets. That represents more than 10 years of output at last year's rate. Boeing had a briefer order peak, with more than 1,000 net orders for the 737 every year from 2012 to 2014. It then added on 588 net orders in 2015 and another 550 in 2016. Even with the 737 falling behind the A320 in the order race lately, Boeing ended last year with an impressive backlog of 4,452 unfilled orders for 737-family jets. Boeing ended 2016 with a backlog of 4,452 orders for the 737. Image source: Boeing. Can Airbus and Boeing ramp up production? In response to strong demand, Airbus and Boeing are in the midst of dramatically increasing narrowbody output. Last year, Airbus increased the A320 production rate from 42 per month to 46 per month. It plans to continue this production growth in the coming years, with output topping out at 60 per month in mid-2019. Boeing is not far behind. It is currently building 42 737s each month, but plans to boost output in each of the next three years, reaching a production rate of 57 per month sometime in 2019. If all of these production increases occur as planned, Boeing and Airbus will each be churning out about 675-700 narrowbody jets annually by the end of the decade. Annual order activity has already fallen below this level and could decline further in 2017. Furthermore, some airlines are deferring orders to later years. This doesn't impact the backlog, but it does reduce near-term demand. Not surprisingly, some analysts see this as a bad time to increase production. AirInsight founder Addison Schonland recently stated that he doesn't expect Boeing and Airbus to go ahead with their planned production increases because the order backlog has already peaked. Furthermore, he thinks that low fuel prices will encourage airlines to defer more orders. We haven't seen this before During many previous industry cycles, declining order activity was followed relatively quickly by production cuts. However, aircraft manufacturers rarely had more than three or four years' worth of production in their backlogs until very recently. Furthermore, Boeing and Airbus have more diverse customer bases today than they did even a decade ago. Aircraft order backlogs are at unprecedented levels right now. Image source: Airbus. In short, the backlogs for the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 are truly unprecedented in terms of size. Additionally, both manufacturers have liberally overbooked their production capacity, building in flexibility to accommodate order deferrals and cancellations. The risk of low fuel prices driving massive order deferrals is also overstated. Fuel efficiency is one reason for replacing older airplanes, but it's not the only reason. As airplanes get older, they become more and more expensive to maintain. Reliability also tends to decrease. This limits the extent to which airlines can keep older planes flying in lieu of ordering new jets. Furthermore, replacement needs represent a relatively small proportion of narrowbody demand right now. For the next five years, Boeing expects an average of about 200 single-aisle airplanes per year to reach the standard retirement age of 25 years. Most of the airplanes on order are needed for growth. If the world tips into recession, it's possible that numerous airlines could cancel their growth plans, driving a wave of order deferrals and cancellations. That would undermine the case for raising production of the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. But a sluggish order environment alone doesn't threaten the scheduled production increases at Boeing and Airbus. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

On November 24, 1971, a man known only as DB Cooper leapt out of a hijacked 727 airliner with a parachute on his back and a bag stuffed with $200,000 (£132,000) of bank notes. AP:Associated Press 6 DB Cooper vanished without a trace after hijacking a plane 45 years ago No trace of him has ever been found. But three scientists working on the case have revealed analysis on a necktie likely left behind by Cooper could narrow down the hijacker’s elusive identity, and blow the now-closed case — the only unsolved hijacking in America’s history — wide open. The hijacking News Corp Australia 6 The hijacked Boeing 727 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport DB Cooper boarded a Seattle-bound Northwest Orient Airlines flight in Portland, Oregon, on November 24, 1971. He had a suitcase with him and sat in seat 18E under the name Dan Cooper. Aged in his 40s and dressed in a smart business suit, Cooper calmly ordered a bourbon, lit a cigarette, and put on dark sunglasses. Shortly after takeoff, he handed a note to the flight attendant nearest to him, 23-year-old Florence Schaffner, which said the aircraft was being hijacked and Cooper had a bomb in his suitcase. Cooper sat next to a terrified Schaffner and detailed his demands: four parachutes, a fuel truck on standby at Seattle airport — where the plane was headed — and a second flight to Mexico City. He also demanded $200,000 in cash – estimated to be about $1.6 million today. related stories BRITAIN’S most notorious UNSOLVED MURDERS The mystery killings that have left cops baffled - including those of Melanie Hall, Suzy Lamplugh and Jill Dando COLD CASE Who killed JonBenet Ramsey?

The attendant relayed Cooper’s demands to the flight crew, and the crew informed the police. As the plane approached Seattle, the FBI rushed to meet each of Cooper’s demands. Then things took another unexpected turn. After the Boeing jet touched down at Seattle airport, Cooper allowed the 36 other passengers and some crew members to disembark. He stayed on the plane and told the pilot to fly him to Mexico, slowly, while remaining below 10,000 feet. As the jet crept its way towards Reno, Nevada, for a planned fuel stop en route to Mexico, Cooper opened a rear door and, with the $200,000 cash and a parachute, jumped out. The investigation In the 45 years since that event, no trace of Cooper’s body has been found, fuelling speculation he survived the jump. AP:Associated Press 6 FBI agents comb a beach on the Columbia River hunting for clues in 1980 Hundreds of theories emerged over the years. Some people said Cooper was a former paratrooper. Various families claimed Cooper was their relative. Someone pointed out the entire hijacking was eerily similar to the events of a 1963 French comic called Dan Cooper. For a while the primary suspect was John List, who murdered his whole family days before the hijacking. Other former suspects included a Vietnam veteran-turned-Catholic priest, a transgender mechanic, and a leather worker posthumously accused by his niece. In 1980 a young boy digging in sand north of Portland unearthed bundles of cash that matched the serial numbers of Cooper’s ransom money. The cult status surrounding Cooper grew, but the mystery remained. “The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world,” author Geoffrey Gray wrote in his book Skyjack: The Hunt for DB Cooper. News Corp Australia 6 Crew members of the hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines flight explain what happened during a press conference But no theory nor claim could confirm who Cooper was, why he hijacked the flight, and if he survived his daring jump. In July last year, after “one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations in our history”, the FBI admitted defeat. “During the course of the 45-year [hijacking] investigation, the FBI exhaustively reviewed all credible leads, co-ordinated between multiple field offices to conduct searches, collected all available evidence, and interviewed all identified witnesses,” the bureau said. “Although the FBI appreciated the immense number of tips provided by members of the public, none to date have resulted in a definitive identification of the hijacker.” America’s most experienced investigators had abandoned the case, but its armchair detectives refused to give up. The new development This week, scientists working for Citizen Sleuths — a group that took up its own investigation into the Cooper case in 2007 — claimed they had a breakthrough. For the past decade, Citizen Sleuths have been working away on the case, publishing their exhaustive research online. FBI 6 A tie left behind in Cooper’s aeroplane seat may have revealed his employer Key members of the Citizen Sleuths team are scientists, including principal investigator Tom Kaye, a palaeontologist and spectroscopy specialist, as well as experts in optical miscrosopy, metallurgical engineering and biological illustration. Their work has attracted the attention of an impressed FBI, which some years ago let them examine clues, including a tie. The black, JC Penney clip-on necktie had been left behind on Cooper’s seat — 18E. And that tie, the citizen sleuths said, has given them a solid clue about the man’s identity. “A tie is one of the only articles of clothing that isn’t washed on a regular basis,” the group explained on their website. “It picks up dirt and grime just like any other piece of clothing, but that accumulation never truly gets ‘reset’ in the washing machine. Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used.” The scientists used a powerful electron microscope to find more than 100,000 particles of “rare earth elements” on the tie, including pure titanium, which most caught their eye. They said titanium was a rare metal in 1971, and linked Cooper to a “limited number of managers or engineers in the titanium field that would wear ties to work”. Citizensleuths.com 6 A microscopic image of titanium found on DB Cooper’s tie Based on this finding, the scientists said they believed Cooper worked for Boeing — the maker of the very plane he hijacked. At the time, Boeing happened to be working on a Super Sonic Transport plane that used those elements. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” the group’s lead researcher, Tom Kaye, told Seattle’s King 5 News. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” The group is now asking for public help to develop their theory Cooper was a Boeing employee. They’ve detailed the list of found particles on their website and hope other citizen investigators detectives can help piece together the mystery of DB Cooper. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie’,” Kaye said. The FBI has said it would preserve evidence from the case at its Washington, DC headquarters but won’t act on further tips unless Cooper’s money or parachutes were found. In the meantime, another amateur sleuth is working away on the case — Geoffrey Gray, who wrote the book about the Cooper hijacking mystery in 2011. He has made published hundreds of FBI files related to the case his online magazine True Ink in the hope opening the case to the public would help finally solve the baffling case. “We’re trying to solve one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time,” he said. “And we need your help.” Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Retired general Tom Lawson, who served as chief of the defence staff from 2012 to 2015, says he believes Canada will end up buying Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet to replace the current fleet of CF-18 Hornets despite the government choosing Boeing's Super Hornet to beef up the current air craft. "There are hundreds of these things flying now and they've been declared combat-capable in the United States," Lawson said in an interview with Evan Solomon, host of CTV's Question Period. "And they'll be getting better and better for years to come. The F-35 is the way forward, not only for the United States but all the members and the partners who have bought into that program." Lawson, a long-time supporter of the F-35, is now retired from the Canadian Forces. In an email to CTVNews.ca, he said he has done several days of work for Lockheed Martin as a strategic adviser, but noted his support for the F-35 dates back to his time as assistant chief of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The F-35 was the source of considerable controversy during Lawson's time as Canada's top soldier, after the auditor general and parliamentary budget officer found a range of problems with a planned purchase of the Lockheed Martin jets. The problems included national defence not telling the government about the aircraft's potential drawbacks or the full costs of the program, as well as not having documents to support some of the decisions defence officials made. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised, during the 2015 election campaign, to hold an open competition to choose the CF-18 replacement, but pledged at the same time not to buy the F-35. Last November, the government announced it was working on buying 18 Boeing Super Hornets as an interim measure while holding a five-year competition to choose a long-term replacement for the CF-18s. Lawson, a former pilot, said that decision caught him off-guard because he believes Canada will eventually purchase the F-35. "Every time the F-35 is in competition, it is the top -- in many cases the only choice out there, and it's becoming cheaper and developing an excellent reputation," Lawson said. "So I think what caught me by surprise is that this putting off of that decision will of course be expensive and very difficult for the RCAF to carry out." The current fleet of CF-18s is more than 30 years old and down from 138 planes to 76, according to numbers provided by the government. During the 2015 election campaign, the Liberals estimated the cost of an F-35 at $175 million per plane, with the Super Hornet coming in at $65 million. Canada has obligations to NORAD and NATO that require a specific number of jets to be "mission-ready," although officials won't say how many planes that means. Defence officials say there aren't enough mission-ready planes, but admit that is due to a change in policy under which they started counting the combined NORAD and NATO commitments. That policy changed on the day they announced the plan to purchase an interim fleet, a defence spokeswoman told CTVNews.ca.

As of Friday, the stock remained the firm’s top pick, and senior analyst David Wong reiterated an Outperform rating with a valuation between $40 and $50. Rating, Justification Wong expects the January 26 quarterly summary to present solid revenue growth in Intel’s Data Center Group either on par with or surpassing the third-quarter rate of 9.7 percent. He also predicted strong figures in client computing group sales despite the company’s guidance report anticipating a decline. Based on the expansion of peer corporations’ expanded notebook sales, Wong said Intel may have surpassed poor expectations that reflected a reduction in global PC supply chain inventory. Considering all factors, Wong estimated fourth-quarter revenue of about $15.7 billion — right in line with guidance. A Look Forward The analyst predicted positive stock activity throughout 2017 inspired by significant growth in revenue, stability in client computing group sales and positive effects of recent restructuring on margins. Although Intel maintains a “dominant position” in the market, Wong acknowledged investment risks including rising capital spending, competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and possible deceleration of growth in PC shipments. Intel closed Friday trading up 1.01 percent at $36.94.

Check out the Boeing airliner President Trump is trading in for Air Force One Benjamin Zhang Jan. 22, 2017, 9:37 AM 6,892,315 facebook linkedin twitter email print "Trump Force One."AP Donald Trump is officially America's 45th president. He is also the first president for whom the VC-25As that serve as Air Force One will not be his first personal Boeing airliner. "Trump Force One" — as some have dubbed Trump's personal jet — was one of the most visible symbols of his run for the Oval Office. Trump likes to call it the "T-Bird," according to a Discovery Channel documentary featuring the plane. According to the documentary, the Trump Boeing 757 reportedly cost a whopping $100 million, though that figure seems highly exaggerated when compared with market prices. The president has owned the Boeing airliner (registration N757AF) since 2011 and has customized the aircraft to his liking. It's unclear what will become of the Trump 757. In all likelihood, the aircraft will be pressed into service for members of the Trump family as well as senior officials at the Trump Organization. Have a closer look at President Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757-200 jet. View As: One Page Slides Though President Trump may be the jet's current owner, he wasn't its first. AP Trump's Boeing 757-2J4ER first flew in May 1991. The new airliner was delivered to Sterling Airlines, a now defunct Danish low-cost carrier. A couple of years later, it found its way into the fleet of Mexico's Taesa, also now a defunct airline. Flickr/Aero Icarus Sources: Federal Aviation Administration, Airfleets.net In 1995, the jet was bought by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. For the next 15 years, the Boeing served as a corporate runabout for the billionaire's various interests. Getty Images Sources: Airfleets.net, FlightAware In 2011, Mr. Trump took delivery of the then 20-year-old jet and added his personal touches — at great expense. YouTube/Trump Source: Airfleets.net The current 757 took the place of the previous Trump jet, a Boeing 727 built in 1969. Flickr/IowaPolitics.com The Boeing 757 is powered by two Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines. YouTube/Trump Source: FAA The Rolls-Royce engines are a feature the president was very keen to have on his plane. AP Source: YouTube Though it's not the most fuel-efficient engine in the world, it is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's earned the 757 a reputation among pilots for being a bit of a hot rod. YouTube/Trump In front, the Boeing is outfitted with a modern "glass cockpit." YouTube/Trump In airline operations, the Boeing 757-200 can carry as many as 239 passengers, but Trump's plane is configured for only 43. YouTube/Trump It has all of the features you'd expect Trump to enjoy, such as ... YouTube/Trump ... a silk-lined master bedroom equipped with ... YouTube/Trump ... a big-screen entertainment system ... YouTube/Trump ... a master bath with 24-karat gold fixtures, and ... YouTube/Trump ... a shower! In total, the plane is equipped with two bedrooms. YouTube/Trump In fact, virtually every fixture in the plane is 24-karat gold-plated — even the seat belts! YouTube/Trump The plane's headrests and pillows are embroidered with the Trump family crest. YouTube/Trump Trump's guests also travel in style. YouTube/Trump There's a dining room. YouTube/Trump The seats have personal entertainment systems and convert into beds. YouTube/Trump There's also a private guest room ... YouTube/Trump ... with another entertainment system. YouTube/Trump But if you want to watch something communally, then there's the main lounge, with its 57-inch screen TV and access to 1,000 movies. YouTube/Trump Everything is controlled by touch screen — even access to Trump's DVR. YouTube/Trump If you get hungry, there's also a galley. YouTube/Trump Though President Trump's 26-year-old Boeing is no spring chicken, it's nonetheless a very impressive private jet.

The machines lay carbon-fiber tape over the forms to create wing spars. (Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Parts for Boeing 777X will be rolling off lines in Everett soon Dan Catchpole Mon Jan 23rd, 2017 12:55pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. The Boeing Co.’s Everett plant is weeks away from turning out the first production parts for its new airliner, the 777X. Workers have spent months and months testing and certifying dozens of pieces of manufacturing equipment on the leading edge of production technology. By late March, they expect to be making parts for the first production 777X aircraft. That plane will never leave the ground. Instead, Boeing will bend, pull and push its wings, flaps, fuselage and other critical structures past their designed limits to ensure the 777X is as strong in real life as it is on paper. Boeing’s 777X is a leap forward in airplane design and production technology. It will have the biggest composite-material wings for a commercial jetliner. And Boeing is leaping forward with automated manufacturing systems — using robots and other autonomous machines to do a greater number of jobs and more complex ones. While the making of the airplane’s massive wings is moving along fairly smoothly, other innovations being introduced for 777X production are proving harder to execute, specifically a new way of assembling airplane fuselages using robotic machines to do much of that work now done by humans. In order to troubleshoot the new technology, Boeing started using it last year on its 777 classic program. Since it first rolled out of Boeing’s Everett plant more than 20 years ago, the 777 classic has been a workhorse and one of Boeing’s biggest profit makers. Its successor — the 777X — is based on the 777 classic. However, it has too many new features to be considered another version of the 777. But the new airplane’s design is heavily based on its predecessor, so much so that Boeing declined to give it a new 7-series designation, such as 797. The 777X family now includes two versions: the smaller 777-8 and the larger 777-9. The 777-9, the version slated for first delivery, is at 30 percent detailed design. It is still heavier than Boeing wants, but engineers have significantly reduced the problem in recent months, said Eric Lindblad, who took over the 777X program in October. Prior to that, he had overseen 777X wing production. In the past five months, engineers have cut the excess weight by 50 percent, he said. “We can see our way to where we need to be when we’re done with detailed design.” The program is on schedule as it moves through detailed design and into production. “The amount of tooling and equipment we need, we put a lot of pressure on the supply stream,” Lindblad said. Given that, plus the scope and complexity of the manufacturing processes that Boeing is implementing, “keeping everything on schedule has been difficult; it’s been constant” effort, he said. Like any development program, unexpected problems arise. “You have to throw a solution together. You get people together,” he said. “You beat the problem back down and get that one solved, and then something else pokes its head up, and you solve that one. It just seems like week after week, there’s always an issue. “You have to pay attention — that’s the moral of the story,” he said. Lindblad doesn’t mind the challenge. “If it was an easy job, I would’ve picked a different one,” he said. One such challenge came on fuselage section 48, at the rear of the airplane. Most of the design work was done by Boeing engineers in Huntsville, Alabama, where the company does a lot of its rocket work. “As we started getting further through detailed design, we learned we had not accounted for a specific load condition,” due to miscommunication, he said. That issue has been addressed now. Boeing spent more than $1 billion on a sprawling building called the Composite Wing Center in Everett, which opened in May. At 236 feet from tip to tip, the wings will be so long that they require folding wingtips to get around most airports. Composite materials allow airplane makers to build lighter, stronger structures that last longer than when they are made with metals. “This carbon fiber wing — there’s nothing like it in the world,” Lindblad said. Automated machines and robots will do most of the work, with human operators at the controls. As production ramps up, so too will the workforce, which could be up to 900 people in the Composite Wing Center. Half of the massive building is a clean room, where machines operated by workers in white lab coats lay down miles of carbon-fiber tape over tooling to make the parts of the wing: skins, stringers and spars. The parts are then baked — or cured — until hardened, in the building’s giant autoclave. After that, they are trimmed, drilled and inspected several times to ensure there are no weaknesses or flaws. “You could get someone walking through the factory like you or I. We could have a piece of dust in our pocket. It could float out of our pocket and end up between two pieces of material, and no one would ever know it had happened,” he said. That single speck of dust is enough to potentially compromise the part’s strength. Parts with flaws could be repaired or scrapped, depending on the situation, he said. The center has one autoclave now. Boeing likely will add a second in 18 to 24 months in order to turn out more 777X airplanes, he said. The huge wings and its new General Electric GE9X engines are the biggest reasons for the more efficient performance Boeing expects out of the airplane when it starts carrying passengers in a few years. The airplane will be able to fit 50 more passengers than its predecessor, the 777-300ER, and should burn less fuel — about 20 percent less per passenger. The actual number of passengers depends on how individual airlines configure the interior. The airplane drew a flurry of orders when Boeing unveiled it in 2013. Few have followed, but that is not cause for concern, industry analysts say. Some airlines might be waiting to see how development proceeds before placing orders. Aircraft orders have slowed down in recent years, especially orders for twin-aisle airplanes, following a years-long spending spree by air carriers. So far, Boeing has received 306 orders for the 777X. The majority — 253 — are for the bigger 777-9, which is slated to first be delivered in 2020. Airlines have ordered 53 of the smaller 777-8. The company is still considering a 777-10, a stretched version of the 777-9, Lindblad said. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

The firm's backers include Tipperary technology entrepreneur and investor John Ryan. Co-founders Dr Conor MacCormack and his brother Fintan, who are both engineers, are eyeing annual growth of up to 50pc, following a partnership with manufacturing giant Flex, which makes products for Google and Fitbit. Mcor, which was founded in 2005, and sold its first printer in 2007, has sold about 1,000 printers, and is taking aim at a competitor, which sells about 2,000 a month, Dr Conor MacCormack said. The company employs 50 staff and the 100 new employees will be added in support, sales and marketing, engineering and software development. Sales will be made through a network of 150 dealers in 50 countries, he added. "It took two years to develop our latest Arke model, and a further year of work with Flex. They can do the manufacturing efficiently and reliably, while we focus on sales and inventing, design and R&D," said MacCormack. Mcor has raised €16m to date, about €10m of which was from European VC firm Alpina Partners, which previously backed Limerick smart bin tag firm AMCS. The new funding is likely to come from VCs or strategic investors in the US or Europe, MacCormack said.

By Leah McGrath Goodman On 1/13/17 at 7:51 PM Close Trump's Attorney Sheri Dillon On Steps Taken To Rid President-Elect From Conflicts Of Interest When Donald Trump this week gave his first press conference since winning the presidential election, he alternately lauded the press and shouted down reporters he didn’t like with jeers such as: “Fake news!” He slipped into stream-of-consciousness rants about everything from Chinese hackers to hidden cameras in hotel rooms “all over the place.” And he denounced pharmaceutical companies for committing “murder.” To this, the Wall Street traders I spoke to had nearly the same reaction: “He’s crazy.” They noted how pharmaceutical stocks, which initially received a boost after Trump’s victory, got hammered after his one-off remarks Wednesday, which also targeted carmakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Investors who had feared tough action on drug pricing under a Hillary Clinton presidency believed Trump would be the safer bet. Not so. At Trump’s presser, he announced that “the drug industry has been disastrous,” adding that he planned to create new bidding procedures for drugs to “save billions of dollars” for Americans and would do the same with other industries, sending stocks into a swoon.

Those are 50-50 odds. I would never play that. No one would, unless they had some inside track. The one thing we hate is binary potential.” President-elect Donald Trump speaks during his press conference at New York's Trump Tower on January 11. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters It’s not so much that Wall Street investors necessarily object to Trump’s plans per se. It’s that the president-elect tends to announce them via highly nontraditional channels and without warning—more often than not, to his 19.7 million Twitter followers at all hours. As a result, major Wall Street traders and everyday investors are racing to find ways to stay on top of his constant tweets, from keywords to algorithms to analytics that track social media. While banks and hedge funds have invested millions of dollars in trading systems that can be tweaked to “Trump-proof” their portfolios, solutions for ordinary investors have been few and far between since Trump won the election. That changed this month. One of the easiest tools to use (and it’s free) is a new app called “Trump Trigger” from Trigger Finance Inc., which offers market information and trading alerts. The app will send a message to users whenever Trump tweets about a stock they own, with options to buy, sell or short. “While it’s no surprise that Trump has been actively tweeting since the election, no one anticipated that a single tweet could potentially eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies,” the company wrote in a blog post last week, introducing the app. Fidelity Investments also offers a feature called “Social Market Analytics” that investors can add to their trading dashboards to track trading signals via Twitter, Facebook and other social media. The analytics tool does this by measuring both positive and negative comments on social media versus the norm. Sentiment indicators culled from social media are increasingly pointing to events before they happen. This was true when Trump complained in a recent tweet about the high cost of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, sending its stock price lower. In fact, Trump’s Twitter followers goaded him into going after Lockheed after he tweeted in December that he wanted to “cancel” plans for a new Air Force One from Boeing, because “costs are out of control.” Ever the crowd-pleaser, when his followers urged him to attack Lockheed too, that’s exactly what he did. Related: Trump business plan casts spotlight on law firm that worked for Russia What’s interesting is that Twitter sentiment indicators for Lockheed shot into negative territory and the company’s trading volume spiked even before Trump’s tweet, because social media had already gone negative on Lockheed hours earlier. Trump’s tweet was just the coup de grace. One big worry: What if Trump’s tweet storms lead to a market that becomes hopelessly reactive to politics instead of economics? A former “bond king,” Bill Gross, who runs the $1.7 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, alluded to just that. He compared Trump’s penchant for singling out certain corporations and bullying them into changing their practices as redolent of the Italian dictator Mussolini. “Some of these pre-term policies, where [Trump’s] cajoling companies to move production back into the United States, that’s fine, but it reminds me to some extent of policies in Italy long ago associated with Mussolini and government control of corporate interests,” Gross said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. “I don’t want it to go too far.” Of course, it could also go too far in the other direction. “At some point, Trump could lose all credibility, both domestically and internationally, where no one takes him seriously anymore,” a London-based trader tells Newsweek on the condition of anonymity because the trader isn’t authorized to talk to the press. “Being the president-elect might give his tweets weight now, but that won’t necessarily last if he wears out his welcome.” On Thursday, Trump abruptly praised L.L. Bean in a tweet after hearing that the granddaughter of the Maine company’s founder, Linda Bean, had donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported his presidential campaign. Most of Trump’s tweets since winning November’s election, however, have been negative. Among the companies he’s tweet-bombed in addition to Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Motors are Amazon, Apple and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies. With this week’s presser, Big Pharma is now on his hit list. Attention from Trump has not been beneficial for most companies, so many investors are actively shirking the stocks he obsesses over. “I am staying as far away as I can from any sectors that Trump seems to be focused on—financials, pharma and the auto industry’s biggest carmakers, I am staying away from it, consciously, yes,” says Tawil. Karen Finerman, co-founder and chief executive of New York investment management firm Metropolitan Capital, says she’s invested in a number of stocks that could be affected by Trump’s running commentary, including tech issues like Facebook and Google’s holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Silicon Valley largely favored a Clinton presidency over Trump) and financial stocks like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup. But the stock Finerman is most concerned about is GM, she says, even though the company’s most recent earnings beat expectations. “That’s the one where I am most tweet-vulnerable, so I guess I am a little nervous,” she says. Finerman did well with tech issues, which initially got crushed after Trump’s victory but edged up after he met with Silicon Valley kingpins in the Trump Tower in December. “When the tech stocks fell, we kept buying as they kept getting cheaper,” she says, “so we did well on that." In other words, when companies take a hit due to Trump that are otherwise healthy, it could be a good buying opportunity. Even so, Wall Street will continue to be extremely wary of what traders are calling “the Trump Effect.” “The only way you can truly insulate yourself from any potential fallout,” Finerman says, “is to not own any stocks. But it’s my job.” Try Newsweek: Subscription offers Pharmaceuticals Related Stories Donald Trump Takes Aim at F-35, the ‘Plane That Ate the Pentagon’ Trump Business Plan Casts Spotlight on Law Firm That Worked for Russia Share Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Like us on Google Plus Follow us on LinkedIn Share with Whatsapp More reddit Pinterest Tumblr Comments Advertisement READ MORE Prosecutors Won't Pursue Bridgegate Charges Against NJ Governor Chris Christie U.S. Judge Blocks Controversial Texas Abortion Provider Regulations Advertisement Advertisement World Haley to U.N.

"It's about the act of an individual,” he stressed, while stating that the carrier will fully cooperate in the investigations.   He added that as a public company, Garuda has its own mechanisms in running businesses, starting from the implementation of good corporate governance to transparency in providing information.   KPK confirmed that this was a personal case and not a corporate one.   And in Thailand, some US$36 million in bribes and incentives had reportedly been paid to intermediaries, including state agents and employees of THAI, to help Rolls-Royce win lucrative engine deals.   THAI released a statement saying it has set up a special task force for investigation of past engine procurement and another for corruption prevention.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in ceremony of White House senior staff in the East Room of the White House on Sunday. Even after officially becoming President, Trump's Twitter presence remains much the same as it was during his campaign.  (GETTY IMAGES)   By Alex LearyTampa Bay Times Washington Bureau Chief Sun., Jan. 22, 2017 It began at 8:19 p.m. Tuesday, an onslaught in all caps -- “FAKE NEWS — A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” -- that burned into the next morning. 7:13 a.m.: Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is “A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.” Very unfair! 7:31 a.m.: Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA — NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING! 7:44 a.m.: I win an election easily, a great “movement” is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! 7:48 a.m.: Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to “leak” into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany? Article Continued Below Days before being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump is as unpredictable and provocative as ever, and Twitter is his bully pulpit, 140-character bursts of shock and awe. Since winning the election, @realDonaldTrump has fired off more than 300 tweets, at all hours, that have enthralled supporters, alarmed CEOs and lawmakers, drawn rebukes from foreign governments and left just about everyone wondering what’s next. He has suggested tectonic shifts in foreign policy, cast aspersions on the intelligence community, jolted the stock market, repeatedly revelled in his victory and trashed the media. When Saturday Night Live and actor Alec Baldwin lampooned the behaviour, which includes retweeting praise from random people, Trump hit back while the show was still going: “unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can’t get any worse. Sad.” What Trump hasn’t done is heed the advice of his wife and, a new poll shows, most Americans: STOP. “The conventional wisdom has never been accurate when it comes to Donald Trump,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. “We’ll just have to see how it turns out.” Trump, 70, is a grandfather who once said, “I don’t do the email thing.” Yet no one in politics has harnessed the power of social media like Trump, with a Twitter following approaching 20 million. Outspent by rivals, he used Twitter to dominate the conversation. “Like it or not,” said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, “you can’t deny it works for him.” “You could teach an entire course about the Internet through Trump,” said Nikki Usher, a George Washington University professor who has added to her social media syllabus a lesson on the “Tweeter-in-chief.” Trump, she said, is putting a modern spin on a long-running quest by politicians to communicate directly with voters, bypassing the media. Franklin D. Roosevelt had fireside chats. John F. Kennedy harnessed television. Barack Obama employed Facebook and video, and was the first president to assume an official Twitter handle. “We need to remember that a majority of the American public is not active on Twitter,” Usher said. “But Trump’s most fervent supporters and most fervent detractors and the media are all just sitting there waiting for him to say something. It’s been incredible at developing a captive audience that will carry his message.” Any expectation Trump would cool it after winning the election has been squelched, though his first tweet Nov. 9, at 6:36 a.m., carried a unifying tone. “Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before.” A day later he tweeted about a “fantastic” meeting with his predecessor and seemed tolerant of protests that popped up in cities across the country. Finally, observers said, he had achieved presidential decorum. But as demonstrations grew, along with questions of Russian meddling in the election and concerns about Trump’s readiness, the bellicose side re-emerged. “The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!” a Nov. 19 tweet demanded after the vice president-elect was lectured at a Broadway performance. On Nov. 29, the president-elect said flag burners should face jail time or loss of citizenship, stepping on constitutionally protected free speech. His early-morning post, retweeted 74,000 times, came after he apparently saw a Fox News segment about a demonstration at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” wrote @realDonaldTrump on Dec. 6. Immediately after that 8:52 a.m. tweet, Boeing stock tumbled. Similarly, Trump sent Lockheed Martin stocks downward with a tweet about the cost of F-35 fighter jets. He has taken on carmakers, warning that if they take manufacturing jobs out of the country they will face a “border tax.” Auto executives have struggled to push back against the rapid-fire claims. “We need clarity. None of us have had a tweeting president before,” Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters. Still, Trump has prompted action. Days before Christmas, he summoned Boeing and Lockheed Martin executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach to discuss bringing down costs. He also took credit for an announcement by Carrier Corp. not to move a plant to Mexico. The morning after House Republicans voted to gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, Trump tweeted his disapproval, helping reverse the move. Other pronouncements, however, have sent shock waves, none more than Trump’s Dec. 22 tweet, sent from his Samsung Galaxy while at Mar-a-Lago: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” Aside from upending decades of policy, the casual use of Twitter made it even more striking. “You wonder what our allies and others think when they see tweets that address very important issues,” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in an interview. The Chinese, the object of numerous Trump broadsides, called on him to quit Twitter. “An obsession with ‘Twitter diplomacy’ is undesirable,” read a commentary this month in Chinese state-run media. “Using tweets is modern day communication, I fully understand that,” said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. “But the way he does it has major consequences. I don’t believe Donald Trump is going to change dramatically. Hopefully, he’ll accept advice more readily before he speaks.” Trump’s advisers seem powerless to intervene. “I do not get a memo,” Sean Spicer, his incoming press sectary, said at a forum last week. “He drives the train on this.” Trump inherited the official @Potus handle, which Obama used sparingly to communicate with nearly 13.4 million followers, but it’s not clear @realDonaldTrump will go away. He has reportedly expressed reservations about giving up his personal phone, as Obama did out of security concerns. A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed 64 per cent of voters think he should not keep a personal account. “I don’t have an issue with him using Twitter. It’s a modern way of communicating,” said Bryan Donathan, 33, an independent voter from Lutz who supported Trump despite lingering reservations. “But there needs to be someone there watching him, telling him, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t say this or you shouldn’t say that.’ It’s sad you have to say that about a president but, unfortunately, that’s the world we live in now.” Read more about: Donald Trump, Saturday Night Live, Barack Obama, Twitter Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 MAHB targets 5%-7% passenger growth by b.k. sidhu Airport operator working on deals to kick-start KLIA Aeropolis SEPANG: Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) is targeting 5%-7% passenger growth this year while it works diligently towards closing some deals to kick-start the development of KLIA Aeropolis cargo-logistics-aerospace hub. It plans to set up its first special purpose vehicle (SPV) for that purpose and is in talks with infrastructure funds from Employees Provident Fund and Permodalan Nasional Bhd to fund and develop 300-400 acres for the cargo, logistics and aerospace development. MAHB managing director Datuk Badlisham Ghazali (pic) said they were in talks with aircraft and parts makers such as Airbus, Boeing, General Electric and global cargo players to set up some plants in the area. “We cannot take on the entire development. We are open to talks with players to set up the SPV. The equity in the SPV can be discussed, we are open about it. “In the case of Mitsui Outlet Park, we had 30% and we can go with that level,’’ he said in an interview. MAHB is spearheading efforts to turn the KL International Airport (KLIA) into a world-class airport city under the KLIA Aeropolis initiative. Thus far, the Mitsui Outlet Park KLIA is up and running, and works on the second phase is expected to be completed in 2018. This outlet is one of the three clusters in the 24,710-acre development surrounding KLIA. There will also be air cargo and logistics, aerospace and aviation parks, and meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions and leisure facilities. All these are expected to boost MAHB’s non-aeronautical income stream, which is about 50% now. “We expect to make some announcements in the second half of the year on the cargo-logistics-aerospace development,’’ he said. MAHB also manages 39 airports in the country and ended 2016 with a 6% growth rate to 88.83 million passengers. It beat its earlier forecast of 2.8%, and the extra passengers was led by more intense competition which led to higher passenger traffic and the return of the China traffic. This year, Badlisham is estimating a 5%-7% broad growth but will refine the figures and announce its KPI headline numbers in February. Nomura Research said in a recent note that Malaysia and the Philippines saw demand growth outpacing capacity, thus driving yields higher in 2016. Malaysia had on Jan 1 introduced the new passenger service charges (PSCs) and when asked if MAHB would make more money with the new PSCs, Badlisham said “the impact will be neutral this year’’. “With more growth and airlines thickening their routes, it bodes well for us,’’ he said. This year the local airlines will deploy more than 20 aircraft locally and 40 regionally at their various bases in Asean. He said the umrah traffic was also growing steadily and that would increase passenger numbers besides the effort to get more China traffic into Malaysia. He said more people are flying for various reasons and MAHB wants to ensure it provides the type of comfort passengers expect at its airports. Towards this end, he is talking about investing more to improve services, especially amenities and facilities at all airports. His theme of optimisation had been on since last year and will be driven further this year as he relooks space usage at all the airports, especially KLIA, to ensure there is better return on investment. He said there would be some capex investment on improving services and facilities but did not diverge any numbers. For now, KLIA is built to manage 25 million passengers but in reality it can handle 30-35 million with better automatisation. “We feel we have not done enough and will optimise first and derive better returns before embarking on a new satellite building,’’ he said. Normura Research expects robust earnings growth of 448.6% in financial year 2017 on the back of depressed earnings bottoming this year, underpinned by the 4.8% growth in passenger traffic (Malaysia), increase in the PSCs and higher retail spending. “In the absence of any near-term onerous capex should boost MAHB’s future free cashflow. There could be more upside to our forecasts on the back of a few key catalysts such as MARCS arrangement to be enforced and the extension of the operating agreement. Besides asking for lease land extensions for Aeropolis from 2034 to a further 60 years, it was also hoping for an extension to its concession for all the airports in the country. Normura maintains its “buy” call on the stock and its two-month target stock price is RM8. The stock closed 10 sen lower to RM6.15 a share on Friday. Bloomberg’s consensus 12-month target price is RM7.02, with eight houses having a “buy” call on the stock, four houses a “sell” call and six a hold call. Bloomberg consensus revenue for FY2017 is RM4.4bil, while net profit is RM200.4mil with earnings per share (EPS) of 12 sen. As for FY2016, revenue is estimated at RM4.2bil, while net profit is RM80mil and EPS at 4 sen.

I did not see any reference to tomahawk which easily has a range of over 1000 miles. Log In or Register to post comments Talyn on Jan 23, 2017 A range of weapons capabilities are needed depending on circumstances/needs. As others have said why use a long-range weapon at a shorter-range target. On the flip-slide the lack of a longer ranged weapon when all one has or procured are shorter-ranged weapons puts assets at risk. Sort of like how the US has spent 90%+ of its weapons procurement on short-range direct-attack ordnance over the last 15+years vs. long range stand-off weapons that can be used to protect key assets at risk from near-peer weapons. The US is waking up to this short-fall but need to procure more than limited numbers of long-range weapons. Log In or Register to post comments Warrant9 on Jan 24, 2017 Why would the US Navy put more ASuW capability on a platform (LCS/frigate) that cannot defend itself, yet is characterized as a replacement for the 50+ frigates removed from service (Oliver Hazard Perry FFG-7s) and then try to sell congress on the fact that 20% of our combat fleet in the future will be one of these lethargic platforms (except for surface strike making them very dangerous, and a fat target for the adversary) in the future, when the Unified Combatant Commanders need capable ‘Show the Flag’ vessels that can provide Proactive Presence requirements while steaming independently? Also, who pulled the Harpoon off of the Cruisers and Destroyers in the first place, and are now claiming a shortfall of ASuW Strike capability, and pushing for this capability to be placed on the LCS/frigate platform. Does this look orchestrated for a desired end (jobs preservation) not actual capability provision? Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Talyn on Jan 25, 2017 There are several foreign-frigate designs, in the same tonnage-class as the LCS designs, that can defend themselves very well, and would add capability to overall fleet strength than the two LCS designs. Log In or Register to post comments Cosmic Observer on Jan 27, 2017 I never thought of LCS as a frigate. More like an over sized mine sweeper, or a ASW platform. and even a forward deployed sensor platform. Its designed to be modular and retasked as needed. Thinking of it as a heavy weapons platform defeats its whole concept. The real question should be is it saving money by not buying all the specialized platforms it is supposed to replace. Log In or Register to post comments Felix A9 on Jan 27, 2017 Because Tomahawk isn't survivable against anybody with defenses. Neither it nor this "new" Harpoon hold a candle to LRASM. Sad. Raytheon and Boeing need to get their crap together and move to the 21st century with the rest of the world. Log In or Register to post comments mfigoff@socal.rr.com on Jan 27, 2017 I think much of it is driven by unit cost as well as launch platform capability. Log In or Register to post comments Just Watching on Jan 23, 2017 It is past time for Western navies to update their Anti Shipping Missile inventory. For a starting point consider the BrahMos ASM, over three times faster than a Harpoon so an defensive engagement window 1/3 that of a sub-sonic missile. True it is heavier, but how much damage would one inflict if you saved weight and used a smaller warhead? Surely someone could 'copy' the design, a good idea is still a good idea even if it's not invented here. Log In or Register to post comments pete patel on Jan 23, 2017 I am so surprised we do not have an over the horizon anti ship missile in our arsenal!!!! Tomahawk may be too expensive, but I am sure a much less expensive version can be manufactured. My be! I wonder how much does the current harpoon costs and what the new one expected to cost? The Trump administration is not going to sit and watch $$$$$ flow out! Log In or Register to post comments Warrant9 on Jan 24, 2017 We spend more money and time creating a target simulating threat weapons than defending against it than developing newer capable weapons. Weaponize the GQM-163 Coyote. Log In or Register to post comments Felix A9 on Jan 27, 2017 If you knew anything about weapons or the Coyote you'd realize it would make a terrible weapon. Fits no existing launch system, tiny warhead (none at the moment) and miniscule range. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Jan 23, 2017 Its all relative. There are not always great or solid answers. First you have to find a target. For a surfaces ship alone, its limited to maybe 40-50 miles depending on how tall its masts are. Your missile then has to hit or find a target. That gets complicated with the need to guide by radar all the way or until the missiles own sensors pick up the target. Wrong target (neutral freighter instead of an enemy destroyer ) oooops So, you send a Tomahawks out to 1000 miles and what does it hit? It takes 2 hours to get there, target has moved 50 or 60 miles and something else is no on seen. Ooopps Supersonic missiles look good but they are big and heavy and how good is the end guidance against a target actively defending itself? How many can you carry? And keep in mind US Frigates and Destroyers depending on what Flight level they are, have helicopters which does extend the range of Radar. They don't carry Harpoon but can spot for it. I don't know why they are not Harpoon Equipped. Longest range missile in the world is worthless if it can't find the right target or gets shot down. I don't know how the balance works. The LCS with their silly little missiles and short range were amazingly stupid idea. P-8 may be able to spot for you, but is it always going to be there? Ditto for any other support aircraft. Can it linger in the area while a missile is on the way for final guidance? Log In or Register to post comments skyefire@skyefi... on Jan 23, 2017 1000 miles is fine against fixed targets, but ships are mobile -- at that kind of range, you're talking about 2-4 hours for the targets to move out of the missiles' search area. Longer range ASMs also have to be bigger and more complicated, meaning you can't pack as many into the same volume; in a lot of scenarios, you'd rather be able to put 15 ASMs on a target 100 miles away than 10 ASMs on a target 500-1000 miles away. This is especially true for littoral combat scenarios, and smaller vessels like the LCS and other frigate/destroyer-category combatants.

Log In or Register to post comments Cosmic Observer on Jan 23, 2017 A supersonic missile will burn fuel faster, have a shorter range, and have a heat signature that can be targeted. The disadvantage of subsonic at longer distances is the time to get there. The answer is a micro drone with a few hours of endurance that can loiter over the target and not be seen. A submarine could tag targets without using a torpedo and giving away its proximity using tiny drones. The drone wars are just beginning. Log In or Register to post comments wcorker@verizon.net on Jan 23, 2017 You need sufficient weight of explosive to insure destruction of the target. If this is not so, then wait for a response from the target. You need counterfire avoidance methods. Sea skimming provides some help on this. You also need a supersonic jet engine to get there first to limit the enemy's response. All of this is academic, I'm sure.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google January 21, 2017 Russia is an active but shrinking geopolitical player where the future will be mostly bipolar between USA and China china, economic impact, economies, geopolitical, russia, united states Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit By the 2030s — Russia may become less dangerous than Iran, which military strategist Andrew Krepinevich forthcoming study from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments ranks currently at No. 3. Krepinevich's analysis of Russia is similar to Nextbigfuture. Nextbigfuture had noted that long term low oil and gas prices and shrinking population are trends that will weaken Russia over the coming decades. Nextbigfuture also notes that the USA and China do not need to fight or have conflict. The USA and China can both be economic winners who prosper in peacetime. The USA and China are nearing economic and technological parity. China's military strength will lag the USA for about 20 years. China is still behind the USA in several technological areas. In particular with large airplane engines and with aircraft carriers. However, the gap is closing and China is competitive with the United States on overall scientific research budgets. Europe was able to mount a program to create Airbus and become competitive with Boeing and has continued to match Boeing airplane technology. There is no reason to think that the US will be able to create a sustainable military dominance like the 1990 to 2015 period while China is an economic and scientific research peer. Any leads will be temporary and copied by the other. China is still projected to average 4-6.5% GDP growth for the next decade while the USA is projected to be at 1-3% growth. China has surpassed the USA on purchasing power GDP and will likely surpass the USA on nominal GDP in the 2025-2030 timeframe. Krepinevich is at odds with defense officials like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Joseph Dunford, Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley, and Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis, who all put Russia first. Mattis is also a hardliner on Iran.

Power plant operators, distributors and dispatchers had the highest median hourly wages at $36.38 among the 50 production occupation groups. On the lower end, median hourly wages for pressers, textile, garment and related materials jobs of $9.84 were lower than wages of other production occupations during the same period. Median hourly earnings are the midpoint in an earnings distribution, with half of jobs having earnings above the median and the other half having earnings below the median. Among the 50 occupation groups within production occupations, there were 1,366,250 miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators in May 2015. The miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators accounted for 15% of all jobs in production occupations, the most of any group. Miscellaneous production workers (881,020) and first-line supervisors of production and operating workers (603,080) followed miscellaneous assemblers and fabricators as the production occupations with the greatest number of production occupation jobs. GM ANNOUNCES $1 BILLION INVESTMENT IN U.S. AUTO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS General Motors announced on Jan. 17 that it will invest an additional $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations. These investments follow $2.9 billion announced in 2016 and more than $21 billion GM has invested in its U.S. operations since 2009, the U.S. automaker said. The new investments cover multiple new vehicle, advanced technology and component projects. A combination of 1,500 new and retained jobs are tied to the new investments. Details of individual projects will be announced throughout the year. The Detroit-based auto giant also announced it will begin work on insourcing axle production for its next generation full-size pickup trucks, including work previously done in Mexico, to operations in Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs. GM said the announcement is part of the company’s increased focus on overall efficiency over the last four years. With a strategy to streamline and simplify its operations and grow its business, GM has created 25,000 jobs in the U.S. − approximately 19,000 engineering, IT and professional jobs and 6,000 hourly manufacturing jobs – and added nearly $3 billion in annual wages and benefits to the U.S. economy over that period. At the same time, GM reduced more than 15,000 positions outside the U.S., bringing most of those jobs to the U.S., the company said. BOEING PLANT USING 3D, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING FOR NEW 777x AIRCRAFT Boeing is using 3D printing and advanced manufacturing techniques at its Everett, Wash.-based manufacturing facility to build the largest wing ever built by the U.S. aircraft maker for the company’s new 777x commercial, which will be the largest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the world. Construction on Boeing’s 1.3 million-square-foot manufacturing plant will take place over the next 18 months, with the roll-in of new tools and equipment. Preproduction parts for the 777x are underway, and nearly 130 mechanics are testing equipment and the first prototype parts, while another 170 employees have moved into the offices so far. Production of the first 777x is expected to begin next year. Following flight testing and certification programs, the first delivery is scheduled for 2020. The aircraft’s GE9x turbofan engines also recently passed two testing milestones in preparation for their delivery to Boeing. The company has invested more than $1 billion to construct the new facility. To see a video of Boeing’s 777x manufacturing operations, click here. Comments comments Previous post Sen.

They have studied the market and see a surge in passenger demand and are getting ready to face that demand with huge investments in new passenger aircraft and enhanced service and maintenance facilities,” said Faber.   His organisation Olympus, is specialist in the inspection and verification of the integrity of an aircraft’s hull and its engines. The company will open its regional headquarters for the Middle East and Africa (MEA) in the UAE in January 2017.   “The move is to be in the market and to be of the market and for the market in the long term. The Middle East and Africa is the next area of growth in the world and we are here to play a more positive role in the growth and development of the infrastructure and economies of the region,” he said. Aircraft safety check and maintenance is a critical element as it is directly related to passengers’ safety. That is why there are stringent requirements for periodic checks. Olympus has high technology products that are a leader in in this field.                                “With the market growing, our local presence here will help our customers with stronger support on a variety of fronts including faster response times for service and product backup,” said Faber. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: fleet | growth | planes | Airlines | new | regional | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Desert Adventures Tourism eyes German-speaking tourist markets Boeing Q4 revenues down 1pc to $23.3bn Farhat Tours celebrates successful 10 years Fun-filled shopping experience awaits Bahrain's mall visitors Farhat International promotes two team members Kempinski Palm Jumeirah to host Kempinski Avenues 2017 Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel scoops 20 awards at Horeca Ascott appoints new director of sales in Muscat 'Google Search' top choice for travel inspiration Autumn Fair opens in Bahrain Connections Events gets top recognition at Eventex Awards Enjoy a romantic getaway at Al Wadi Desert, Ras Al Khaimah Mövenpick Hotels accelerates expansion plans Abu Dhabi records 4.4m tourists in 2016 New Muscat airport terminal to open by 2017 end RJ booth at Madrid tourism fair attracts large visitor numbers Abu Dhabi airport traffic tops 24.5m in 2016 Oman Air opens new grooming centre Stratajet partners with Mr and Mrs Smith Turkish Airlines, PIA expand code share deal Etihad expands B787 network in the Levant, Far East Spain Tourism launches new website for GCC customers Seventh Boeing 787 joins RJ fleet Copperchase wins $500m Iraq airport contract Dubai 'popular timeshare destination for Africans' Hyatt Regency debuts in Riyadh Carlson Rezidor to open 17 hotels across ME Dubai's First Central Hotel Suites receives Green Key certification Central Park to be main attraction of new Cityland Mall Emirates offers special fares to its US network Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

AMEinfo EXPERTS Talking Tech by Faisal Al Bannai DarkMatter Taking Stock by Hussein Al Sayed FXTM VIEW ALL EXPERTS After Airbus, Iran in aircraft deal with ATR? January 22, 2017 10:51 am Turboprop maker ATR has completed commercial negotiations with IranAir for the sale of at least 20 aircraft and expects to be able to sign a contract very soon, the head of the Franco-Italian aircraft maker said on Friday. The deal will come after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe’s Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear programme. “We have concluded the negotiations and we should sign the contract imminently,” ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer said. Scherer was responding to some Iranian media reports on Friday that ATR had already announced the signature of the keenly awaited deal. Iranian officials said in December that a deal for 20 twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-600 aircraft was close. IranAir and ATR have spent months negotiating a firm order for 20 ATR 72-600 aircraft worth 540 million euros ($576 million) at list prices, with options for another 20. All three manufacturers have received U.S. Treasury export licences to sell to Iran, a step required even for European firms since all modern Western aircraft rely on many U.S. parts. Even so, industry sources say all three may need further approvals or extended cover in order to complete deliveries. That is likely to re-focus industry attention on the direction taken by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has voiced opposition to the nuclear sanctions deal.

Home Latest Popular Pakistan Today's Paper Opinion World Sport Business Magazines Culture Blogs Tech Multimedia Archive In Depth SEARCH Another bailout package for PIA allowed Khaleeq Kiani — Updated Jan 20, 2017 05:37pm WHATSAPP   20 Comments  Email Email Your Name: Recipient Email:  Print ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday allowed another bailout package for the troubled national airline and increased the quantity of wheat export to 1.3 million tonnes to reduce surpluses that may cause price crash. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. The ECC also approved payment of one-month salary to the employees of the Pakistan Steel Mills outstanding since October last year. According to an official statement, the meeting approved a request for increasing the government’s guarantee limit for the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) by Rs10.5 billion to Rs161.5bn to address its immediate challenges. It also constituted a committee headed by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal to prepare yet another business plan to improve the airline. According to informed sources, the airline’s management pleaded that its fiscal challenges had multiplied after a recent plane crash (PK-661), though it had been running with liquidity crisis for many years. Continuous money injections over the past three years, it said, had improved the number of PIA planes and efficiency, but revenue could not pick up due to a reverse challenge — surplus capacity and low yields. Urgent plane inspections after the recent crash not only further affected the operations but also the revenue flow, the management said, adding that non-payments to aircraft lessors, fuel suppliers and service at home and abroad had reached a stage where the airline might be forced to ground its fleet and cause international default such as to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan State Oil, Boeing, Air France, Bakri, Euro Control and spare parts and engineering service providers. Thus, it said, there was an urgent requirement of about Rs7bn to meet “overdue liabilities”. On top of that, the PIA reported another requirement of Rs25bn to finance or roll over various loans guaranteed by the government before June 30 this year. For this all to achieve, the PIA management sought support of the government to increase its guarantee limit to Rs161.5bn from Rs151bn. Wheat export The ECC approved a proposal of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (NFSR) to increase total exportable wheat quantities to 1.3m tonnes from 900,000 tonnes. Therefore, it also approved extension of time period for export of surplus wheat and its products till March 15. Under the decision, the governments of Punjab and Sindh would be able to export additional quantities of 200,000 tonnes each to ease surplus wheat stocks, purportedly creating financial and storage constraints to the provincial governments that could lead to a price fall to the benefit of consumers but to the disadvantage of the growers. The government had in July last year allowed export of 900,000 tonnes of wheat at $120 per tonne subsidy from public funds with a deadline of Nov 30. The two provinces failed to meet the deadline which was extended till Dec 31 with a permission to also export wheat products like suji, maida, etc, on the same subsidy rate. On Wednesday, the ECC was informed that Punjab could export only 380,000 tonnes against a target of 600,000 tonnes and Sindh 240,000 tonnes against a target of 300,000 tonnes. The NFSR ministry said the two provinces had now sought permission for increased exports in view of substantial stocks lying with the public sector. It said the current wheat stocks stood at about 7.8m tonnes which was much higher than the strategic stock requirement of 3.5-4m tonnes and supported the two provincial governments’ request for increasing the export quantities with extension in the deadline. It was argued that additional exports were necessary to enable the provincial governments to free up storage space and liquidity to cater for 2016-17 wheat crop growing due in April-May. The ECC approved additional export of 400,000 tonnes of wheat and its products, with a permission to also clear backlog on the same condition i.e. subsidy of $120 per tonne. It decided to allow export of wheat and its products till March 15, with a directive to complete the process by May 31.

They will likely be piling up rapidly. President Trump did use Day 1 to advise the CIA that the United States should have stolen all of Iraq's oil. But here is a place to start. We already have a president who is violating two clauses in the U.S. Constitution, one forbidding any gifts or benefits from foreign governments, the other forbidding the same from the U.S. government or any U.S. state. This is the result of Donald Trump refusing to separate himself from major business interests as past presidents have done. Those interests will also inevitably involve Trump in violating the STOCK Act which forbids the use of non-public government information to make a private profit. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states: "The President ... shall not receive ... any other emolument from the United States, or any of them." This means that the President cannot receive personal financial gains from the United States government or from the governments of any of the 50 states while he is president. This restriction is absolute and cannot be waived by Congress. Trump is already in violation of it and will be more so with every law, rule, regulation, enforcement, or lack thereof that his subordinates, Congress, or any agency of the federal government enacts to the benefit of Trump's businesses and possessions. For example, Trump's lease of the Old Post Office Building violates an explicit clause in the General Services Administration lease contract which states: "No ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom." The GSA's failure to enforce that contract is an unconstitutional benefit to Trump. Or, to take a state-level example: since 1980 Trump and his businesses have garnered "$885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York." Continuing or increasing those subsidies puts Trump in violation of the Constitution. Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution says that "no person holding any office of profit or trust under [the United States government], shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state." This is essentially the same ban as above, but applied to foreign governments. - Advertisement - The Trump Organization has licensing deals with two Trump Towers in Istanbul. Trump himself says, "I have a little conflict of interest, because I have a major, major building in Istanbul." China's state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the largest tenant in Trump Tower. It is also a major lender to Trump. Its rent payments and its loans put Trump in violation of the Constitution. Foreign diplomats have begun shifting their D.C. hotel and event reservations to Trump International Hotel. The Embassy of Kuwait was reportedly pressured by the Trump Organization to do so. Pressured or not, Kuwait's business at a Trump hotel puts Trump in violation of the highest law of the land. In November, there were reports (denied by Trump) that Trump had asked the president of Argentina for help with a building permit in Buenos Aires. Whether he did or not, and whether he receives that help or not, President Trump will be frequently granted or denied similar approval for his business ventures from numerous foreign and domestic governments. Why punish a successful business man? We can set aside the legality and morality of Trump's business success, and the question of how successful he has been. A campaign to impeach him for his violations of the Constitution can hold the position that Trump is perfectly welcome to keep all of his businesses and loans. He just cannot simultaneously hold an office in which they create gross violations of the U.S. Constitution. Past presidents have sold off their assets or placed them in a blind trust. A blind trust would not, however, be blind for Trump who would inevitably learn of the approval of new towers or the sale of properties. Selling (and using a truly blind trust to do so) was Trump's only option other than not being president. He chose not to take his only Constitutional choice. Is this partisanship? - Advertisement - A great many people do anything political for partisan reasons. As I'm unable to put an end to that, it is inevitable that people will favor or oppose impeaching Trump for partisan reasons. But they need not. The above charges against Trump are unprecedented. They should apply to him and any future presidents who engage in the same abuses, regardless of party. Someone who voted for Trump as a way out of corruption should want him impeached as much as someone who voted against him for the same reason. Trump is now the worst possible "insider" -- using public office for personal greed. Is this morally worse than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking Saudi government and Boeing funds into her family foundation, and then working to waive legal restrictions on Boeing selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- weapons now being used to slaughter innocents? Some will think so and others not, largely along partisan lines. Personally I'm in favor of impeaching Clinton, Obama, and George W. Bush right now and imposing the penalties of a bar on holding future office and a denial of retirement benefits. But those efforts are simply not the same priority today as halting the presidency of the current president. When I advocated for impeaching Bush I explained that if he was not held accountable his successors would expand further the abusive powers he had expanded. When I argued that Obama was in fact doing this and should be impeached, I was generally called worse things than partisan. But the longer presidents are allowed to act without a check on their powers, the more they will expand and abuse them. Numerous government officials and members of Congress would best serve the world by resigning. But the place to start is with an unprecedented and unique form and level of corruption in the single highest office in the land. Is this personal?

The question of who is worse, the president or the vice president, is a very different question from this one: Who is worse, President Trump in an era of total unchecked power and immunity, or President Pence in an age of popular sovereignty with the threat of impeachment looming behind every high-crime-and-misdemeanor that comes up for consideration by the White House? I believe changing the office of the presidency into one that can be lost for substantive crimes and abuses -- a radical change from its current state -- would be more significant than the personality, ideology, or party of the presidents who come next. I believe part of that significance would derive from the benefits of building the movement that imposes impeachment on a corrupt and partisan and reluctant Congress. Cultural change comes principally from movement building, and very little from the personalities of elected officials. Submitted on Monday, Jan 23, 2017 at 3:31:02 PM     (0+)   J.

That said, I think that Pence's greatest threats might involve perfectly legal and by some greatly desired actions such as filleting the remains of Planned Parenthood; abolishing legal abortion and demonizing contraception; continuing assaults on unions, minimum-wage workers, immigrants, minorities, and environment; further shredding social-safety nets; further enabling the parasitic and highly unstable financial shenanigans that at some point, if continued, will come crashing down again, and worse ... Does anyone know what Pence thinks about TPP and other inevitably looming 'free-trade' agreements? Mike Pence's biography page is hosted by ALEC. There is no doubt that Donald Trump is at least as corrupt as the congress over which he presides--he even appears to conflate the meaning of 'conflict of interest' with 'ability to multi-task'--but the prospect of empowering a Christian Ayatollah fairly shivers me timbers.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter quartz index about us register log in log out Events Atlas quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu UNDERWATER ROBOTICS IIT students may give the Indian Navy its next big thing: an intelligent unmanned submarine Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains January 23, 2017 Quartz india Matsya 4.0 (AUV-IITB) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains January 23, 2017 Quartz india In a country where schools and universities have long championed rote learning, a team of engineering students is doing pioneering work on “a submarine with a brain of its own.” Since December 2011, students at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay have been working on Matsya, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can control its own movements and execute specific tasks without human intervention. The project, if successful, can change the future of defence in India by making underwater vehicles intelligent enough to understand their surroundings and react accordingly. For now, the unmanned vehicles used by the country’s naval forces are not exactly intelligent machines—they’re piloted remotely. This means they cannot venture into unknown waters and respond to unusual activity or even an enemy submarine by themselves. Matsya’s technology could train machines to act independently. Military forces in the US and China already use unmanned submarines and the global AUV market is on track to more than double from $211.8 million in 2016 to $497.9 million in 2022, thanks mainly to defense demands. India’s foray into the field is fairly new, though. “While space exploration has been unmanned for obvious reasons, development of underwater unmanned vehicles started [in India] only recently,” the IIT project’s 21-year-old team leader, Varun Mittal, told Quartz. Matsya, named after Hindu god Vishnu’s fish avatar, can ensure constant monitoring and immediate intelligent action during military operations, eliminating the room for human error. Using it, ecologists, too, can explore depths hitherto off limits for humans or monitor ocean life more consistently and accurately. Even though Delhi Technological University, IIT-Madras, and other government entities worked on AUVs before 2011, the Matsya team is “aiming to make something no one in our country has achieved ever before.” Their autonomous submarine is intelligent enough to re-attempt a task if the previous try is unsuccessful. Testing new waters 18 members from this year’s Matsya team. (Facebook/AUV-IITB) The AUV-IITB team comprises upto 30 undergraduate students from the mechanical, software, and electronics verticals, who spend late nights—9.30pm to 12.30am—every day after regular classes. On weekends, they work longer. “It’s a challenge to motivate people when doing something related to tech because it can take months or years of hardwork to get results,” Mittal said. Matsya’s initial prototype operated on a simple “single-hull system” that could navigate from one point to another and identify objects underwater. Seven years in the making, its applications have extended to “dropping markers, shooting torpedoes, grabbing objects, listening to underwater sound sources, [and] identifying different colours and shapes all on its own,” Mittal said. Each year, the team recruits freshmen and seniors graduate. Despite the churn, their performance is unaffected: They have won the best Indian team title at RoboSub, an international AUV competition, for four consecutive years since 2012. During RoboSub 2016, when 50 teams from 11 countries faced off in San Diego, Matsya bagged the second place overall despite being penalised for exceeding the 38-kg limit. The top spot went to Caltech University by a slim margin, according to the breakdown of the scores. Last December, the team came out on top at the National Institute of Ocean Technology’s (NIOT) Student Autonomous Vehicle (SAVe) competition held in Chennai. Next up, it is creating a more hydrodynamic fifth-generation prototype for the 20th edition of RoboSub this July. The competition is organized by the US Navy and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the world’s largest nonprofit organization with an exclusive focus on advancing unmanned systems and the robotics community. Matsya 4.0 (actual) vs 5.0 (design) (IIT-B AUV) Swimming big Currently, the 3.5-feet Matsya ventures upto 150 feet under water with batteries that last four hours. In comparison, Boeing’s AUV is over 30 feet long and dives as deep as 20,000 metres (6,096 feet). Leena Vachhani, an associate professor in IIT-B’s systems and control engineering department who has been involved with project since it’s inception, describes Matsya as “a mini AUV” designed for shallow-water tasks like “cleaning of water tanks and lakes.” Once the IITians master its functionality, they hope to scale up their “micro-submarine” technology for real world applications. “Each team leader comes up with his vision on his own,” Vachhani told Quartz. The team is in talks with the Indira Foundation to map River Ganga’s dolphin population using Matsya’s hydrophones, an underwater microphone that detects sound waves. The Indira Foundation is an association of IIT-B alumni, providing scholarships and funding student research. IIT-B’s design could prove revolutionary for Indian military operations: autonomously shooting torpedos; placing and monitoring sensors on the seabed; tracking down and destroying enemy submarines by itself. AUVs could also carry out rescue missions, recover remnants from plane crash sites and locate black boxes, Mittal says, like the AUVs looking for the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. Matsya can also conduct routine sub-sea inspections like checking for leaking underwater oil pipelines, while ecologists can use it to monitor flora and fauna and environmental conditions. Funds crunch The IIT students are strapped for funds, though. To build and showcase Matsya at competitions, AUV-IIT needs Rs2.5 million ($36,708) this year, of which more than half the amount goes towards purchasing sensors and cameras. So far, the team has gathered more than Rs1.5 million ($22,025) from the institute and other government sources and it’s still using up a one-time grant of over Rs2.5 million it received from the Naval Research Board (NRB) at the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 2013. But the team desperately needs more. Unfortunately, private sponsors are reluctant to place their bets on a first-time experiment. “Especially in our country, technology is just starting to boom here,” says Mittal. “So people think a lot before investing.” The only way companies provide sponsorships is in the form of discounted parts for Matsya. “If asked where do we stand now on a scale of one to 10, where one denotes only a prototype and 10 a product of industry level, I would say we are currently somewhere near six or seven,” said Mittal. Although there is no official launch date for Matsya’s defense or ecological deployment, he says an optimised, functioning version of their vehicle could be ready within four years.

The ACT Airlines cargo flight from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Bishkek crashed on Jan. 16 as it came in to land amid bad weather conditions at 7.31 a.m. local time (0131GMT). Saginbek Rahmanov, a 29-year-old Kyrgyz national succumbed to his injuries at the hospital on Sunday, the ministry said, bringing up to 35 the number of Kyrgyz citizens who lost their lives in the crash. The remaining four victims are Turkish citizens including Capt. Ibrahim Gurcan Diranci, co-pilot Kazim Ondul, loading expert Melih Aslan, and flight technician Ihsan Koca. Another 16 people remain hospitalized with injuries sustained in the crash, the statement added. Two black boxes from the cargo plane were sent to Moscow Thursday for investigation, according to the Kyrgyz Prime Ministry. The Prime Ministry Press Office also said in a statement Thursday that experts from the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee would investigate the flight recorders to find the reason for the crash. ACT Airlines operates under the name myCARGO. Based in Istanbul, it flies eight Boeing B747 transport aircraft, according to the company. The firm is 49 percent-owned by China’s HNA Group with the remainder belonging to Turkish interests. In a statement last Monday, the company said it was "deeply saddened" by the incident. It said the crash was not due to technical reasons or overloading and added the real reason would be revealed to the public after an investigation was completed. Turkish Airlines has issued a statement to clarify the aircraft was not operated or staffed by its personnel.

Missile Defense Agency continuing work on interceptor site in Eastern United States Jeff Martin, jmartin@waaytv.com Jeff Martin Jan 19, 2017 0 Missile Defense Agency The Missile Defense Agency's Flight Test 06b Ground-Based Interceptor launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., June 22, 2014. In a white paper released this week, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has called for a large military buildup to the tune of more than $430 billion over five years. Part of it, about $5 billion, would go to missile defense, which is a big part of the work on Redstone Arsenal.  One of the main missile defense proposals is the building of a Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) site in the eastern part of the United States. According to Huntsville's Missile Defense Agency, an environmental impact study is under way to pick such a site, but there is no timeline as to when it will be released to the public. According to a release, the finalists are Fort Drum in New York, Camp Ravenna Joint Training Center in Ohio and Fort Custer Training Site in Michigan. GMD is a program that intercepts missiles in the "midcourse" phase of flight. That's the portion where it is in space, heading towards it's target. Currently, the US has sites at Vandenberg AFB in California and at Fort Greely, Alaska.  But, the system goes far beyond the above-mentioned sites. It includes radar and data sites on Alaska's Shemya Island and in Great Britain, Greenland, Colorado, New York, Japan and on the Sea Based X-Band Radar.  Boeing is the prime contractor on the program, but Northrop Grumman, Orbital ATK and Raytheon play significant roles.  McCain goes on to say in the white paper "missile defense systems must also be modernized to keep pace with our advancing adversaries." That could mean additional work on Redstone Arsenal, developing technologies like what McCain calls "directed energy, hypervelocity projectiles, high-power microwaves, battle management using learning machines, and space-based capabilities."  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

Wed., February 1 Homes Jobs Close Don Eberly  Thriving economy for all is essential for our democracy DON EBERLY | Special to LNP Jan 22, 2017 (…) Don Eberly  Jobs are central to human dignity.  Of all the issues that contributed to the electoral earthquake in 2016, none was as potent as the fear working Americans have of wage stagnation and rising inequality.   The perception driving the revolt of working Americans — which is that the economy is producing a limited number of winners and lots of losers —turns out to be true. Research from a team of prominent economists concluded that while the economy doubled over the past 35 years, generating enormous wealth, the lower half of working class Americans —117 million workers — saw little to no growth in wages during that same period. The great American wealth-creating machine basically took a sudden detour and moved on without them. The basic question for American democracy is this: How long can a nation so economically divided maintain political harmony? A great disruption Democracy does not function independent of economics. In fact, elections are the means by which people in a free society act upon their interests and challenge their country to honor its promises. Few promises are more central to the American dream than upward mobility, and none is more consistently promised. That we are in the midst of another period of great disruption, this one fueled by a voraciously advancing technology, is obvious. Is any of this new? Well, yes and no. America has been through dislocating economic transitions before, the greatest of all perhaps being the Industrial Revolution. And in the past, when farm labor was replaced by machines, displaced workers left the farm to take jobs in factories. The same happened when the carriage-making industry was replaced by Henry Ford’s automobile assembly lines. It was painful, but people moved on. They got new training. They sold their homes and migrated elsewhere.    Today, jobs are being lost in the coal country of West Virginia but are being re-created in the natural gas fracking regions of northern Pennsylvania.  This is the reason American society is more mobile than any other, with average Americans moving between two and three times in a lifetime.   Many who understand this dynamic in rural towns have already left in search of greater educational and employment opportunity. This is the story of our own history: a boot strap mentality and lots of mobility. Dishonest claim It is not surprising that political debate would attempt to distract us from what is really going on. No claim is more dishonest than the one generated in the 2016 campaign that trade is to blame for wage stagnation. It simply lacks a factual basis and is a good example of emotions overcoming facts in politics. Much of the growth in our economy over the past 20 years has had everything to do with expanded global bilateral trade, all agreed to by treaties.   To mess with it is to invite global trade wars, depression and even war. This has happened before. Why should China listen to our harangues about their flooding our market, particularly when all they are doing is giving consumers the cheap household products they want? Don’t be surprised if China and other countries stop buying our Boeing jets, our cars, Apple phones and Microsoft computers and our agricultural exports. Realities of free trade Does trade hurt some workers and help others? Of course it does. But the most destructive idea is trying to imagine a trade policy in which America’s workers only gained, and our competitors’ workers lost. That would reflect a nation that is becoming immature and doesn’t comprehend its own self-interest. Rather than attacking free trade itself, it would actually do the U.S. economy less harm if we just provided an income subsidy to those affected, although that goes against everything we believe about income redistribution. If the problem for workers today is not mostly trade, it is the growing dominance — in our lives and workplaces — of technology, which is often uncritically accepted as a good thing. A majority of steel industry jobs were not lost due to bad trade deals, but rather to automation and technology, and most of those jobs will not be coming back. Coal as a commodity is no longer in demand, not because of bad trade deals, but because it is no longer competitive with natural gas.   What is different today from the past is the unprecedented possibility that a majority of jobs involving repetitive physical tasks will be replaced entirely by robots and artificial intelligence, permanently killing off tens of millions of jobs requiring limited skills. Before us is a revolution like none that came before, and it will require a level of candor that is not common in our public debates. Questions about technology What happens if the current wave of disruption destroys many manual jobs altogether, leaving workers nowhere else to go? What if the genius of capitalism is now arriving at the point where rather than generating opportunities up and down the income scale, it is instead destroying jobs and concentrating rewards on the few?   And what happens when it becomes clear to workers that 1 percent of income earners are growing wealthier because of the very innovations that are causing their own wages to stagnate? America has succeeded thus far in avoiding a destructive class war, but class tensions were no small part of the energy behind the new populism of left and right alike that surfaced in 2016.   Is it possible to maintain a healthy and balanced democracy if we don’t have a healthy job-creating economy?  This was a major fear that drove working Americans to vote for President Donald Trump. Coal miners and steel workers were led to believe that their jobs will be coming back.   What precisely are we to do? Do we need to rethink the idea of unlimited technological progress, particularly if it becomes clear that it comes at the expense of social progress? Economic freedoms are not absolute, any more than any other freedom is. They must operate under an umbrella of ethics and in the end will be forced to serve the greater good of all, not just a few. Why, for example, must we accept in the name of progress that it is a good thing for 3.5 million truck drivers to be displaced by self-driving trucks?  Should society, through its lawmakers, step in and say no, we’re not going there? Prepare yourself for that debate.   Don Eberly, of East Hempfield Township, is the author of several books on civil society and has had a career in national and international policy, including serving two presidents.

Even though Musk had stated “he is not the right guy,” according to CNBC and referring to the President, he was called to join the table of strategic business advisers. Investors are grimacing at the line of communication held between Musk and Trump, as it will allow a higher degree of coordination with the government, paving the way for the evolution of the company and its projects. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk (L) and U.S. President Donald Trump (R). Image Credit: Market Watch. Politics aside, Musk and Trump will cooperate with each other  Apparently, most of Elon Musk’s projects are of Trump’s liking, seeing that his rocket-building factories and Tesla assembly lines have provided the country with thousands of dignified jobs, which coherently served as Trump’s main leverage point during his presidential campaign. Reportedly, Musk has the hope that the next administration will put in motion most of its plans to make the U.S. a leader in world affairs, including business and technology. Colleagues of both Musk and Trump acknowledge that both are very similar in some fields, being world-class salesmen and leaders. “The President-elect has a strong emphasis on U.S. manufacturing and so do we. We are building the biggest factory in the world right here, creating U.S. jobs,” stated Musk during a session held with investing analysts according to CNN. Image credit: Elon Musk. SpaceX is already enjoying financing from the U.S. government as it signed a contract to launch a U.S. Air Force GPS satellite into orbit, which is expected to occur in 2018. Having a direct line of action with the government and the military will ensure that SpaceX will become the primary transport company linking U.S. affairs and affordable space travel. Signing such contract with SpaceX “achieves a balance between mission success, meeting operational needs, lowering launch costs, and reintroducing competition for National Security Space missions,” according to Lt. Gen. Samuel Greaves, Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space, as reported by CNN. SpaceX is not the only company in the market, but its latest affairs have shown that it is capable of becoming a dominating force in what we know as space travel. Boeing-owned United Launch Alliance and Amazon-owned Blue Origin try to be at par with SpaceX, but by privately meeting with the President of the United States and scoring an $82.7 million contract, Elon Musk appears to have the lead in the race. The company also enjoys other contracts provided by the government, such as the task of shipping supplies to the International Space Station and to launch U.S. astronauts into space, people that are perceived as invaluable assets for the scientific progress of the country and who are put at risk during every launch procedure. According to Elon Musk, a mission headed to Mars will take no longer than two years to occur. The plan is to send a specialized Dragon spacecraft to the Martian surface in order to collect soil samples, while also performing measurements to better understand the conditions that astronauts would have to endure while walking on Mars.

Trump's first week: President Donald Trump is beginning his first week in office. He's promising sweeping reforms including repealing the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare), reforming the country's trade practices, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Since many of Trump's policies are still undefined, it's not clear what the impact to the economy will be. But investors seem optimistic. Markets spiked on Friday following the inauguration, but the so-called "Trump Bump" has deflated since the election with the Dow far away from hitting 20,000. 2. Samsung faces the press: On Monday morning in South Korea, Samsung will hold a press conference revealing what caused the Galaxy Note 7 to catch fire. It's a result of a months-long investigation conducted by the world's bestselling smartphone maker. The news conference will mark the second time Samsung tried to explain what went wrong. The first time around, Samsung pointed the finger toward one of its battery suppliers. On Thursday, Samsung will release its fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings. 3. Loads more earnings: It's another big week for earnings as President Donald Trump takes the reigns of the country. Yahoo, AT&T, Alphabet. Microsoft, Starbucks, McDonald's, Boeing, Ford and Samsung will report earnings this week. For some companies, the reports will shine light on how robust the holiday shopping season was. For AT&T, investors will be listening for what's to come for its merger with CNN's parent company Time Warner. Trump has wavered on his support for the merger with AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson recently meeting with him, although the merger didn't come up. 4. First reading of GDP: On Friday, we'll see how healthy the U.S. economy is under Barack Obama's last few months and what President Trump is inheriting. In the third quarter, the U.S. economy grew 3.2% according to the Bureau of Economic Analysts boasted by consumer spending and exports led by soybeans. 5.

Founded in 1937 Plane crash in Kyrgyzstan 22/01/17 17:20 1556 views Analytics 0 A Turkish cargo plane crashed in Kyrgyzstan on January 16 early morning near the capital city of Bishkek, killing 38 people, including crew members, citizens of Turkey. The cargo plane belonging to Turkey’s MyCargo (ACT) airlines was flying from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan’s capital and had to refuel in Bishkek. The plane was attempting a landing at the Manas international airport in thick fog, and crashed 1,5-2km away from the runway of the airport into a village of Dacha-Suu. As a result of the crash dozens of houses are destroyed. Dacha-Suu village is located on the west side of Manas airport. There are 425 houses in the village and about 270 families reside there permanently. As the tragedy took place early morning at about 7am, while the most of people were sleeping in some families all the members were killed. In connection with the crash, January 17 was declared in Kyrgyzstan a morning day by the decree of President of the country Almazbek Atambayev. The President ordered to fly a national flag at half throughout the territory of Kyrgyzstan, and on buildings of diplomatic and consular missions abroad as well as cancel entertainment events on TV/Radio channels of Kyrgyzstan. The same day a governmental commission is formed to study the causes of the plane crash. Speaking with reporters at the crash site the same day First Vice Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev told that the cause of the plane crash might be a crew error. He said that a few planes landed safely prior to this accident, which means the weather condition was appropriate for landing. "The weather conditions were allowing the cargo plane to be landed," he said, adding that the crew members of the crashed plane have previously landed three times at the airport in Bishkek. Now three flight recorders have been found at the crash site and sent to Moscow for decryption. Besides, representatives of the International Aviation Commission, observers and representatives on technical assistance from the country where the aircraft was developed and representatives of the country, whom the aircraft belongs arrived in Kyrgyzstan to investigate the crash. Some local media reported that the part of the cargo on board of the crashed plane was destined for Kyrgyzstan and therefore it was going to land at Manas airport to discharge the cargo. Meanwhile, the press service of Manas airport refuted this information and said that there was no cargo in the plane destined for Kyrgyzstan. Deputy director of Turkey’s MyCargo (ACT) airlines Hamza Tiglay also confirmed the information of the airport’s press service saying local reporters in Bishkek that the aircraft, flying from Hong Kong and which was supposed to land in Bishkek was heading to Istanbul. "The place of destination is the city of Istanbul, not Bishkek. We land in Bishkek exclusively for resupply of fuel and crew changes. The main purpose of landing in Bishkek is not a delivery of cargo, but refuel and change a crew," he said. He also added that its possible to fly from Hong Kong to Istanbul directly without landing in Bishkek. However, the presence of a heavy cargo requires refueling and crew changes. Due to such reports in media the Kyrgyz Parliament created a temporary parliamentary commission to study to whom the cargo was destined, which was on board of Boeing - 747. There was 85.5 tons of cargo on the board of the crashed plane. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan continues to receive condolences and words of sympathy from all the parts of the world and books of condolences are open in many diplomatic missions of Kyrgyzstan abroad. People from all the regions of the country have expressed a desire to render aid to families of victims. Many organizations, companies, ministries and departments of the country transferred their one-day salaries. Kyrgyz citizens abroad also gathered money in assistance to the relatives of those killed and injured. "It is a pity that all this happened suddenly. And we are upset here in America and pray for the injured and for the families of people who lost relatives and friends. We are not indifferent to what is happening at our homeland," Victoria Tabeleva, a Kyrgyz citizen, who lives in Texas said by adding that they gathered $ 4000. Meanwhile, the head of the fund "Its easy to help" Dinara Alyaeva published in the social network that the youth group from the UAE gathered $ 2 thousand and 303 kilos of humanitarian aid for the relatives of those killed and injured in the crash of Boeing 747. On Friday Kazakh citizens delivered humanitarian aid to Kyrgyzstan. Konstantin Avershin, the leader of the group of support wrote on social network about the delivery of food products and articles of daily necessity to victims of the plane crash, which was gathered by Kazakh citizens living in Almaty. President Atambayev also expressed, on behalf of the people of the country the deep appreciation and gratitude to all the citizens, activists rallied due to general grief, as well as staff of relevant government agencies, volunteers, assisting in the aftermath of the crash. "Despite the difficult conditions, cold, fire, they rescued people and continue to help the victims. There were old people and children among them. Their moral and material support, selfless and harmonious work of rescuers and medics, honest attitude to life of many civil activists eloquently testify the fact that healthy, creative forces are dominated in our society, capable even during the harsh tests of the fate to unite to support and to substitute a friendly shoulder. We were once again convinced that our society is becoming more united and stronger than the state," he said. Almazbek Atambayev also expressed his appreciation and gratitude to the leaders and citizens of foreign states and international organizations for the expressed condolences and support in these difficult days.

Executive vice president products and Brand Development Eng. Abdulaziz Al Raisi commented: “Over the years, Oman Air has made enormous investment in new aircraft, new destinations and an array of exciting products and services – each with the aim of providing an even more enjoyable experience for our guests. We have been able to achieve this with the generous support of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman. However, that support has been reduced significantly over the last three years and Oman Air is progressing towards becoming entirely self-supporting." “However, Oman Air has opted not to make savings when it comes to guest experience.  In fact, we are continuing to invest in guest comfort and the high quality of the services we offer. Our A330 interiors attracted widespread international acclaims when they were first unveiled in 2009.  Our new A330 interiors for First and Business Class surpass those high standards and guests are sure to be delighted with the results”.

Grace Pascoe reports on the first day of the Singapore Air Show. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Planemakers must deal with both the yin and the yang. Whilst the global economy falters, demand for aircraft remains strong. At Singapore's biennial airshow Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier remains confident in the industry. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AIRBUS PRESIDENT AND CEO, FABRICE BREGIER, SAYING: "People try to project themselves into the future and the impact of air traffic. As a matter of fact, we don't see it, our competitors don't see it, our customers don't see it, we have never been so healthy, this is the reality. And we are planning for more efficient aircraft for deliveries as you can see, which go well beyond 2020." Neither Airbus, nor Boeing expect delay to deliveries or cancellation requests. And production lines are loaded for rapid growth After a boom in orders has defied the industry's growing number of sceptics. Airbus COO John Leahy says middle class spending is driving aviation. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AIRBUS COO, JOHN LEAHY, SAYING: "They fly for business, they have disposable income they fly for pleasure, and they're the ones who are sitting in the seats of airliners around the world. And the middle class in Asia Pacific will be driving the world going forward. And of course there is also South America and parts of Africa, etc. other parts of emerging markets. This is the key, this is the growth engine, that's driving our industry." No large orders have been placed yet at the airshow. But with oil at multi-year lows, and airline balance sheets strong New orders may be on the cards.

Print this article Donald Trump is finally in power marking the new era.  His policy plans in the first couple of weeks will override fundamentals. Markets spent more than two months pricing in growth policies promise, lowers corporate taxes, and deregulations, now it is time to deliver as markets will move on actions rather than words. US dollar bulls were not really impressed of the new Presidents’ inauguration speech, as it was focused more on protectionism and lacked concrete plans to drive growth. Repealing Obamacare, building a Mexican border wall, and withdrawing from the Trans Pacific Partnership was not the kind of news investors wanted to hear, they needed to know when pro-growth fiscal policies will come into play and more importantly whether congress will approve them.   The days and weeks ahead will likely see volatility increase in equities, fixed income, and currency markets. Investors are already buying exchange-traded products that track volatility; this explains the level of expected uncertainty going forward.     The week ahead will also see US earnings season move into high gear with more than 20 per cent of S&P 500 companies reporting fourth quarter results including Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, McDonald’s, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing, EBay, and AT&T. According to Factset, 61 per cent of the companies that reported results so far managed to beat profit estimates, while only 47 per cent managed to beat on revenues. On the US economic data front, all eyes will be on Friday’s US Q4 GDP release. Growth is anticipated to slow significantly from Q3 3.5 per cent to only 2.2 per cent, as net trade expected to turn negative. Homes sales, services PMI’s, trade balance, and durable goods are also on the agenda for next week. It will also be an interesting week for sterling as U.K.’s Supreme Court will eventually deliver its ruling this Tuesday on whether Prime Minister Theresa May can activate the process for Brexit without parliamentary approval. We highly expect that the court will rule in favour of Parliament’s approval to trigger article 50, but any spike in sterling is likely to be short lived.        Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Finance Search S&P; 500 CEOs optimistic on TrumpAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 12:41 PM AEDT US President Donald Trump's administration has only just taken over, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies' chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday's inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines and other major US corporations said the Trump White House had already sparked a brighter outlook for business. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank reported fourth quarter profit had doubled. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the November 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. More than a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the past week have signalled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong US dollar in 2016, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 per cent in the December quarter and 13.6 per cent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied six per cent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline president Scott Kirby told analysts on a call: "It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand". Also, upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, CEO of F.N.B., which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. "There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn't happen before," Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern's CEO on Friday bemoaned an uncertain environment after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico's peso since Trump's election. "Obviously, the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump's victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. Still, while Trump's views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odds with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The US consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the September 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might baulk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labour in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. "Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade and immigration," warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues." Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor, General Motors, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin. That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. "You don't want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic; positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you're not trapped one way or another," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump's frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. "Each time, it's a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we're watching it with interest," TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.

(Photo: Getty/iStockphoto) Dividend strategies on Wall Street go to the dogs in January. But there appears to be a better way. I’m referring to the so-called “Dogs of the Dow” strategy, which calls for investing each January in the 10 stocks from the Dow 30 with the highest dividend yields. It got its name because the stocks it recommends are typically out of favor on Wall Street. Over many decades of backtesting, the strategy outperformed the Dow itself. A funny thing happened on the way to the bank over the past decade, however. Over the 10 years through the end of last year, for example, the Dogs of the Dow strategy has produced a 6.8% annualized gain (as judged by the Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Index), assuming dividends were reinvested. That’s 0.7 percentage points per year behind the dividend-adjusted return of the Dow Industrials itself. The best-performing dividend-stock strategy among those I monitor has done markedly better. This superior approach is the one recommended by an investment advisory newsletter called Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. Over the past 10 years, according to Hulbert Ratings, its model portfolio of dividend-paying stocks has produced an 8.1% annualized return. At the core of Wright’s approach is the belief that higher-dividend-yielding stocks aren’t necessarily better bets than those with lower yields. That’s because a high yield doesn’t necessarily indicate undervaluation. For example, a high yield might also mean that the company is in financial distress and that it could soon cut or even eliminate its dividend altogether. In that event, of course, its stock would plummet. USA TODAY Trump's Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin denies he ran 'foreclosure machine' As an example, Wright, in an interview, referred to Eastman Kodak, the erstwhile giant of the photographic film industry that eventually, in the wake of the digital revolution, declared bankruptcy. Yet for several years in the early 2000s, it was one of the Dow Dogs. “All it took was a bear market, and an adherence to an obsolete technology,” Wright added, for this “Achilles’ heel” of the Dogs of the Dow strategy to be revealed. Another core principle behind Wright’s approach is that a given dividend yield means different things in different industries. Stocks of utility companies, for example, typically pay hefty dividends (an average of 3.2% currently among utility stocks within the S&P 1500 Composite Index, according to FactSet), while retailers often pay more modest dividends (an average of 1.8% currently). But that doesn’t automatically mean you should favor utility stocks over those of retailers. Putting these two principles into practice, Wright recommends that investors searching for attractive dividend-paying stocks focus only on companies rated highest for financial quality, and buy them only when their dividend yields are near the high ends of their historical ranges. To illustrate, compare Disney (whose current dividend yield is 1.5%) with Altria Group (with a current yield of 3.6%). Despite Disney’s lower dividend, Wright believes it to be the better bet than Altria. That’s because Disney’s yield is near the high end of its historical range (which extends from 0.8% to 1.6%), while Altria’s yield is at the low end of its range (which has been from around 4% to as high as 7%).

Wright notes that the company lost money over the last year, and argues this means the company’s dividend is risky—especially in contrast to other companies which have consistently earned money year-in and year-out. Of the 10 dividend payers that are currently one of the Dow Dogs, Wright is recommending just two as part of a buy list of the 13 most attractive dividend-paying companies: Disney and IBM. The other 11 stocks on Wright’s so-called Lucky 13 list are: American Express, Boeing, CVS Health, Eaton Corp, Franklin Resources, Omnicom, Philip Morris International, Texas Instruments, TJX Companies, T. Rowe Price, and Union Pacific. Mark Hulbert, founder of the Hulbert Financial Digest, has been tracking investment advisers' performances for four decades.

European aviation giant ATR says it is close to a final agreement with Iran to sell turboprop planes to the country – a new move which is expected to further boost the Iranian aviation might.   ATR Chief Executive Christian Scherer was quoted by the media as saying that his company had completed commercial negotiations with Iran’s flag carrier airline Iran Air for the sale of at least 20 planes.   Scherer added that a contract to the same effect would be signed “very soon”.  “We have concluded the negotiations and we should sign the contract imminently,” Scherer was quoted as saying by Reuters.  Iran Air and ATR have spent months negotiating a firm order for 20 planes worth €540 million ($576 million) at list prices, with options for another 20. Both sides signed a basic agreement last February to go ahead with the purchase order.  The planes were reported at the time to be the twin-engine turboprop ATR 72-600 aircraft each capable of carrying 70 passengers. Last week, Iran’s Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said a deal with ATR - which is co-owned by Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo Finmeccanica - would be signed “within days”.  Fakhrieh-Kashan emphasized that five of the planes would be delivered to Iran by April. He also added that all ATR aircraft would be used on domestic flight routes.   Iran signed contracts with European plane maker Airbus and American aviation giant Boeing in December to purchase around 180 jets.   The country received the first Airbus plane – an A321 – in early January with officials saying that more deliveries would be made within the next few months.  Boeing’s first deliveries are expected in 2018.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Manufacturing CEOs readying for the expected Trump expansion By Salena Zito • 1/22/17 12:00 AM Salena Zito Contributor The Washington Examiner Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More American manufacturing is already showing signs of confidence and optimism about a Trump presidency. President Trump says he will be the greatest jobs producer God ever created. "I'm going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job," he said recently. While his critics laughed and economists urged caution, the truth is American manufacturing is already showing signs of confidence and optimism about a Trump presidency. U.S. CEO's are rewarding the incoming administration with a flurry of announcements promising new jobs, bigger inventories and a reduction of operations moving to Mexico and abroad. Some of those announcements have come under the pressure of tweets by Trump directed at a handful of companies, but most are a nod of confidence to his promises of tax and regulatory reforms. They are also a sign of approval of his blunt tough talk on China's practice of currency undervaluation and the deliberate dumping of its products into the U.S. market at below the cost of production.

Those two practices, along with high-tech automation, have cost blue-collar workers their middle-class job opportunities and economic stability for a generation. It's a situation that pushed many of those same workers to vote for him. "The election results can be really important to our business," said Bryan Iams, vice president of corporate communications for PPG Industries in Pittsburgh. "As we look at it through some early discussions that we have had with the members of the transition team for" Trump, he said, "we are hearing that there is going to be a sharp focus on some key areas that are really important to companies like ours." The Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the United States lost 286,000 manufacturing jobs during the time President Barack Obama was in office. Employment gains were in lower-paying retail and food services industries, where 3,238,800 jobs were created. Manufacturing jobs average hourly earnings is just over $26 an hour according to BLS. Food service jobs are half of that at $13.60 an hour with retail jobs slightly higher at $18 an hour. The loss of those manufacturing jobs due to automation and bad trade deals and the destruction of the coal industry by regulations have soured many voters in the Rust Belt on the Democratic Party and their candidates. Trump's rhetoric and "Make America Great Again" offered them a message of hope and tangible benefits that Hillary Clinton failed to deliver.

By Anna Giaritelli • 01/27/17 7:36 PM Iams said he has also been meeting with members of congress about the Trump agenda. "All of the conversations have been centered on timetables for a comprehensive tax reform package, infrastructure spending, and regulatory reforms," he said. Iams said infrastructure spending means more of his high-end coatings will be used in those projects on bridges, roads, buildings, ships, and so forth. "And lower tax rates gives us the ability to repatriate cash that we have that has been currently stuck in some other parts of the world. Which means we can reinvest here in U.S. operations where we do all of our research, development and manufacturing," he said. Iams would not put a number on hiring or expansion plans, said: "We are feeling confident and we are optimistic. And that optimism coupled with those public policy issues will make us grow and produce more in the US." Founded in 1883, PPG is the world's largest manufacturer of paints and coatings. Its employees are not only skilled laborers, but scientists, chemists, engineers and high-tech workers who manufacture paint, coatings and materials worldwide, with operations in more than 70 countries and more than 46,000 employees. More than 18,000 PPG employees in the U.S. work at 35 manufacturing facilities in places like Springdale Pennsylvania, Strongsville Ohio, Oak Creek, Wisconsin, as well as plants in Michigan, Texas, South Carolina among others. Also from the Washington Examiner Vote set for Trump's EPA nominee amid Democratic opposition Top Democrat Sen. Tom Carper, of Delaware, complained that Pruitt's answers to questions were inadequate. By John Siciliano • 01/27/17 7:25 PM Other company chiefs are offering optimism as well. Last month, U.S. Steel CEO Mario Longhi predicted 10,000 steelworkers could be back to work under the business-friendly policies of a Trump administration. In the week that Trump won the election, the Bloomberg Americas Iron/Steel Index, which tracks the value of steelmakers in North and South America, reported an 18 percentage jump for the industry. As if on cue, U.S. Steel announced last week it plans to reopen an idled plant in Keewatin, Minnesota, a move that will bring approximately 202 furloughed employees, in December the steel company also announced plans to reopen a shuttered mill and blast furnace plant in Granite City, Illinois, restoring 220 jobs that have been idled since 2015. And in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, Jason Morris, president of the family-owned company Dura-Bond, said the shift in the mood of the country toward buying American and supporting American manufacturers had prompted him to buy the manufacturing assets of a shuttered U.S. Steel plant. Morris will lease the steel company's building and rail line and begin tubular steelmaking sometime this year. Over 260 employees lost their jobs in June of last year after U.S. Steel said unfairly-imported tubular steel products were hurting its business. Steelton, Pennsylvania's Dura-Bond bought a Bethlehem Steel pipe mill in 2003 and the plant has been at 100 percent capacity for over a year. The oil and gas industry is a major part of Dura-Bond's tubular steel pipe business, and energy will be a part of the reviving American workforce under a Trump administration. Trump indicated in several speeches last year that he was going to free up the regulations that were hurting the coal, gas and oil industries, something that causing Consol Energy COO Tim Dugan some optimism in an industry hit hard by regulations. "We are very encouraged by the prospect of a regulatory and political climate that recognizes the importance of our domestic energy resources," he said. Dugan added that challenges remain with regard to the pipeline infrastructure necessary to effectively bring energy to markets, "But we anticipate a streamlined regulatory environment that will help encourage further buildout of this infrastructure and growth across the energy space," he said. Consol energy employs over 2,300 people in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Virginia. For the past few years the company has undergone a transformation from a legacy coal producer to a natural gas company. Trump has also created some unease among American CEOs as he has moved the needle with companies by using social media to declare where they should build their cars, make their air-conditioners or create new jobs with Tweets. He has taken aim at Ford, General Motors, Carrier, industrial parts maker Rexnord and aerospace companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin, generating more jobs and lower costs in the process. But Trump's approach is not unprecedented. Other presidents, such as Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy, all used sharp elbows, salty language and the press to issue edicts. Roosevelt certainly did when he put big business on notice during the original progressive era. Truman did when he squashed a looming railroad strike by issuing an executive order putting American railroads under the control of the U.S. Army, and Kennedy did as well when he publically shamed steel executives for raising prices. It is unclear if Trump's unorthodox methods will continue to be successful. But what is clear in the Midwest, many CEO's are optimistic that he will have major positive impact on their business plans. Top Story Trump signs national security orders, critics cry 'Holocaust!' President Trump on Friday signed two national security-related executive actions on Friday, while attending the swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary James Mattis, one relatively uncontroversial and another that has opponents bringing up the Holocaust. One action is an executive memorandum focused on rebuilding the military, something Trump has frequently promised to do. The other is an executive order aimed at stepping up screening measures for people entering the country from areas besieged by terrorism. Trump has repeatedly called on the government to implement "extreme vetting" with individuals entering the U.S. from terror-filled insecure regions.

Business Home LBoard COMMENT A nation of bystanders Mariam Mokhtar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Optimism among S&P 500 CEOs as Trump takes power Reuters | January 22, 2017 Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. SAN FRANCISCO: US President Donald Trump’s administration is only hours old, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies’ chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday’s inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines and other major US corporations said the Trump White House has already sparked a brighter outlook for business. “There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016,” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank said profit doubled in the fourth quarter. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the Nov. 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. Over a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the last week have signaled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong dollar last year, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 percent in the December quarter and 13.6 percent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied 6 percent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline President Scott Kirby told analysts on a call, “It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand.” An also upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, Chief Executive of FNB., which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he was saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. “There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn’t happen before,” Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern’s CEO bemoaned an uncertain environment on Friday after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico’s peso since Trump’s election. “Obviously the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us,” Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump’s victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. Surging confidence Still, while Trump’s views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odd with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The US consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might balk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labor in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. “Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade an immigration,” warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues.” Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor, General Motors, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin. That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. “You don’t want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic, positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you’re not trapped one way or another,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump’s frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade. “Each time, it’s a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we’re watching it with interest,” TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.
