 Apple should be relying huge right now on the Trump election.  Because the market has discounted that overseas cash. Makes no sense.
 Apple has  230 billion in cash overseas.  if it can repatriate it for a single quarter's worth of cash flows, that's obviously worth it.
On the other hand, Trump's plant to force companies to bring back manufacturing or face stiff penalties could be potentially bad for  Apple

If Trump is successful and  Apple is allowed to repatriate all of its cash for a 10% tax, it's valuation would absolutely skyrocket overnight
 GOOG  Apple easymoneylucy: To contact  CSOC - easymoneylucy 
On the positive side, Trump wants companies like  Apple to repatriate their cash and his platform is calling for a 1-time repatriation of 10%
President Trump isn't necessarily bad for  Apple.  He has one huge positive and a potential negative.  But overall, I would say more positive
