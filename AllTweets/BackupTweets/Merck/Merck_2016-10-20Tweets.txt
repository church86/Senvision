 hugodraws //going with this, but thanks for taking it all in stride and chatting. None of my other friends are that interested.
 hugodraws //kinds of people is super impressive. I dunno. Maybe gwynn has the right idea. One person at a time. Not sure where I was//
 hugodraws //angry than I currently am. It's for me to preach kindness, and honestly people showing any tolerance at all to those//
 hugodraws //with bigots. Ever. By virtue of who I am, and by virtue of where I live. Honestly if I did, I'd be a lot more//
 hugodraws Yeah and that's kind of what I meant about talking out of my butt. It's easy for me to say it, I don't really have to deal//
 mrk_bennett i wish that the fact that i want people who arent me to have human rights and civil rights was enough, but i have to be sweet 2
 mrk_bennett yeah... my composure is usually pretty good. Im just tired of having to prove my virtue against homophobes and bigots....

 hugodraws //I feel like I'm not 100% conveying my brain here, but I hope that made at least some modicum of sense.
 hugodraws /I'm talking from my butt being in a country that is relatively protected from the world, but I feel like thats the best approach
 hugodraws //we do when people lash out, or get angry. We should always at least try and have those open arms. I dunno, perhaps/:
 hugodraws Its one of the best things you can do! You can only do what you can do. And I think the real 'test' so to speak is what//
I truly believe this is possible ErinHanley  customerthink
 mrk_bennett yeah. Maybe I'll do more if I ever talk to him outside work or get to know him even better, not just as a coworker
 mrk_bennett but i protect my friends and people who need it when i can, which hopefully counts for something.
 mrk_bennett i try to be kind, but thats not always nice. So many people are cruel and lash out like injured dogs. Im no different.
Saw a Nissan GTR with a custom design themed with Iron Man. The plates though didn't made any sense. If he could have used Merck 1 instead
 GwynnAndTonic That is totally fair. Same here, party support lines are fairly fierce and politics are not a comfy subject
 hugodraws You always gotta try to be nice to everyone https://t.co/aFKXDZBhsz

 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett should the evidence if conservative madness become too much for him. I hope he thinks more abt this....
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett he seems like a reasonable person, but blind to the suffering of others. Let him know he is welcome on our side.
 mrk_bennett Questions are fine! We didn't get too deep, I tried to keep it slightly light a) because we gotta work b) I'd get mad if not
 mrk_bennett  hugodraws path, and probably just needs time. His gf is Hillary supporter and has helped change him. He's open to change
 mrk_bennett  hugodraws for sure! And I would like to say, in the time i've known him he's become more and more liberal. he's on the right
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett thats fair.

 GwynnAndTonic Hmmm, even the stuff that is straight from trumps mouth? Sorry about all the questions, very few trump supporters round here
 mrk_bennett  GwynnAndTonic kieran, you are balm to the spirit. I wish more people were like you
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett well as his team lead i'd like to not try to toe the line on this stuff. civil talk w/ each other is ok
 GwynnAndTonic  hugodraws But I think you're in that position, you need to actively try and be aware of that kind of thing
 GwynnAndTonic  hugodraws Oh yeah, definitely! I mean the number of things I dont think about even just as man are many and varied
 mrk_bennett No real idea, aside from thinking they're blown out of proportion by media etc.
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett maybe hand him a copy of Mein Kampf to read. Its only words. It was only ever words.
 mrk_bennett  hugodraws oh for sure. but sometimes it's easier to not be aware of injustices that aren't against you/your culture
 midgetsnowman  mrk_bennett I definitely understand. I only am able to here because I know the guy and he is very very nice
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett knowing this person exists gave me acid reflux. Im so tired... of people who dont consider others' rights...
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett they're from a long time ago
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett also he believes most of the things are taken out of context, blown out of proportion, or don't matter because
 GwynnAndTonic  hugodraws I am all those things you mentioned yet I still have the self-awareness to see how harmful that stuff can be
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett life experience) who thinks trumps talk is all talk, and doesn't see how harmful trump's talk, and actions are
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett Just dismiss that concern. Making it hard to like..want to empathize with them?
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett wrong about the no bite, part, then well, then I'm absolutely 1000% screwed. And republicans who are pro-trump>.
 GwynnAndTonic Hmmm, interesting. I can understand that conclusion. How did he reconcile trumps behaviour and more, uh, interesting beliefs?
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett same here. I think it's from his perspective as a white cis het male (not that those are bad things just a different
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett thats the problem for people like me though. Its not easy to believe that when you're say..mexican, and if >
 aiong14344 not yet permitted post here::please wait a little more!
 GwynnAndTonic  mrk_bennett i... am disappointed that he believes these things. Im glad he isnt actively dangerous and angry but ... sigh...
 mrk_bennett and also had someone with foreign knowledge. So, republican, but doesn't want to shove his lifestyle down people's throats
 mrk_bennett Also, he is for the republican ideals, smaller gov't, less taxes. Would be a libertarian if the party had enough support
 mrk_bennett Also these are all my coworkers ideas, I do not agree with most/all, but i can see how he'd think them
 mrk_bennett in it for all of america to make it great again. Also like trump's enthusiasm.
 mrk_bennett so he hasn't destroyed coworker's trust. He feels hillary is only in it for herself, and while trump may be misguided, he is
 mrk_bennett won't actually. Hillary is someone he cannot trust, she has been in office and has done bad shit, trump hasn't been in office
 mrk_bennett clear otherwise I feel I'm misrepresenting him. He feels Trump is all bark and no bite, like he'll threaten to do things but
 mrk_bennett First, he did make it clear he didn't like either nominee, but thought Trump was lesser of 2 evils. Just want to make that

We dont know who the rebels are, but hey, fear them anyway
 hugodraws  rbristow I am 100% being satirical. Its a secondary mode for me and is a fierce defence against constant tears

 swisslight YA SOMOS HELMANAS Merck LOVE YOU!!!
 mrk_bennett  lothlorien_elf (reading thw back of a shampoo bottle) gotta get caught up on this lore
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett It wasn't lore it was like the building records. I have read more appealing textbooks
 lothlorien_elf  mrk_bennett but now you get to brag about it tho isnt that fun? You have that library cred
 hugodraws  lothlorien_elf Dat sewer lore
 lothlorien_elf  mrk_bennett maybe by your standards. I like to hear all that lore.
 mrk_bennett  hugodraws But I shouldn't have
 ClaudiaAHidalgo mrk ya duerme
 lothlorien_elf  hugodraws Kidding, sounds awful
 lothlorien_elf  hugodraws Ah but you did finish it, obviously had some merit
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett No it was the dullest thing I have ever forced myself through
 mrk_bennett  hugodraws Yeah, a little bit would be ok but 50 pages on its history was not necessary!
 lothlorien_elf  mrk_bennett literally as long as the prose is elegant, ill read it. The content doesnt have to be there.
 hugodraws  lothlorien_elf Would explain why the sewers feature for literally 4 minutes in the musical
 hugodraws  mrk_bennett Problem is there are no characters in those 50pages just the french sewer system
 hugodraws  lothlorien_elf I do not, so I imagine I would be less of a fan.
 lothlorien_elf  mrk_bennett idk i used to read a lot of Romantic lit so this sounds kinda like the sort of thing id like
