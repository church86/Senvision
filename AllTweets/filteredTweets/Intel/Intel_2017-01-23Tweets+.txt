The crazy thing about this rift, is that it's not the media. These are senior intel employees. Under oath. To congress.  PressBriefing
Spicer: Trump "wanted to dispel the myth" about rift w/ intel community they might have heard  about "on television" (And his Twitter feed.)
They just don't know when to stop lying. 
 Spicer claiming media is responsible for Trump-intel rift is ridiculous.  trump has attacked intel over  russia, said intel=nazis
I thought those cheers sounded a little odd.. 
 seanspicer  msnbc  cnn  Acosta SPICER GIVING "ALTERNATE FACTS" THAT INTEL COMMUNITIES DIDN'T HEAR TRUMP CALL THEM NAZI'S!!!
People...if Spicer is talking about "so called rift" with intel agencies, isn't anyone going to ask about the Prez's own tweets on rift?
If Donald  Trump supports and respects the Intel Community why did he compare them to Nazis  seanspicer?

 PressBriefing
 ktumulty  PressSec Thoughts on him accusing press of "undercutting" Trump on intel "rift" with no comment about Trump's attacks on them?
Spicer doubling down, saying media invented rift with intelligence community. The same intel community Trump compared to Nazi Germany.
 SolomonRDavid Good. Intel officials by trade do not do this at political events. Seriously offensive in so many ways.

. PressSec: Trump wanted to tell intel “all this stuff on TV about this rift that so-called exists….don't believe what you're hearing"
"Don't believe what you're hearing," Spicer says of the supposed rift between intel community & Trump, who compared intel leaders to Nazis

Couple of bomb blasts in Pakistan, and Indian Intel is happy. Altaf is gone, MQM is gone. Karachi is fucked.
 Spicer: Trump tells intel "don't believe what you're hearing." No, believe what you're reading on Twitter from his own account.
Does  PressSec think that people can't read the tweets from Pres. Trump where he compared CIA and intel to Nazi Germany?
. seanspicer: Trump wanted CIA not to believe what they heard in the media about feud w/intel agencies

Reminder: 

After calling the Intelligence services "Nazi Germany" Sean Spicer will like you to know that Trump was just hearing about rifts with Intel
