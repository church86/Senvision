 Apple ROADMAP for 8/2 forward, post earnings:

 GuyAdami hmmm  Apple  134. A bit of a stretch. Do they pay u guys for advice?
 Apple ain't bringing any cash back to the US, would be just ignorant shit to do that.
 Apple im doubtful it gets much higher than low 160's
 Apple has a EPS of 1.67 . Low-cost iPad wand 10.5 iPad were good ideas.  Apple on a all time high. No reason to doubt of this company.
I have no position in  Apple but if I was going to short it, I would watch for a break of the VWAP from time of EPS release.
Evan Spiegel can't wait for lockup to end August 8th so he can buy   aapl
unfortunately, it won't be like  250B in Q3 2017

so growth slowdown

and also doomed lol  Apple
