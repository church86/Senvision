 Google hired writers from Pixar and The Onion to make Assistant more personable Avery Hartmans Oct. 10, 2016, 10:32 AM 2,278 facebook linkedin twitter email print A scene from Pixar's "Wall-E." Disney / Pixar Google wants its Assistant to be more than just an order-taking robot — so it hired some clever writers from outside the company to help make it happen. A new story from the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims details the advancements of different artificial intelligence devices like Amazon Echo and Google's rival product Home, and how they're comforting for those who live alone thanks to how personable the AI's have become.  For Google, that friendly personality is thanks to a team of writers from Pixar and The Onion who helped make the Assistant — which powers Google's Home device — sound more like a human and less like a robot, according to the Journal. Google's eventual goal is to help users build an emotional connection with the Assistant, the Journal reports. Google unveiled its Assistant-enabled Home device last week, a direct competitor to other AI-powered hardware devices like Amazon's Echo. The Assistant itself is similar to Alexa, which powers the Echo: It has voice-recognition software, natural language recognition, and it gets smarter over time. You can ask the Assistant to tell you a joke, give you the weather or set a timer, but you can also ask it to do things like remember your favorite sports team or the city you live in. Much like other AI — like Alexa or Apple's Siri — the Assistant can be equal parts sweet and sassy, which is what helps it seem more relatable and more human. The Assistant lives inside Google Home, but it's also enabled in Google's new messaging app, Allo and its new Pixel smartphone.  SEE ALSO: Google just launched its answer to Siri.

Rachel Graf Oct 10, 2016 2:20 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Alphabet  (GOOGL) were gaining in mid-afternoon trading on Monday after Axiom increased its price target to $1,000 from $990 and reiterated a "buy" rating on the stock.  The Google parent company will likely exceed consensus estimates when it reports 2016 third quarter earnings on October 27, the firm wrote in a note cited by Barron's.  The fourth quarter should beat expectations as well, and 2017 should be strong due to search innovations and continued growth at its YouTube unit, Axiom noted. YouTube's strength should help offset a tough Google Websites comp from a year ago, when Google launched a third search link on mobile, the the firm stated.  Additionally, Wells Fargo believes that Google will continue to take share from "non-TV media," and could see an uptick in revenue from "non-advertising marketing services," TheFly reports. The firm reiterated an "outperform" rating on the stock. Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates the stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of A. Alphabet's strengths include its compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance and reasonable valuation levels.  (Alphabet is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS.

 Following in the footsteps of Apple and Amazon, Google wants to put its new smart assistant inside cars Avery Hartmans Oct. 10, 2016, 11:12 AM 1,635 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the company's hardware event last week. AP Google's new Assistant is already enabled in its messaging app, its Amazon Echo-like Home device, and its new Pixel phone. Now, the company wants to put Google Assistant in vehicles, too.  The artificial intelligence-powered Assistant is similar to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa and gets smarter over time. It was first unveiled in Google's new messaging app, Allo, last month, powers Google Home, and comes standard on Google's new smartphone. According to the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims, Google is now pursuing partnerships with automakers to let the Assistant work directly with vehicles.  Google is following in the footsteps of other major tech companies who have partnered with carmakers to integrate their digital assistants. Apple's Siri works with GM vehicles — it was first launched in the Chevrolet Spark and Sonic in 2012 — and Ford announced at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show that it was partnering with Amazon to integrate its vehicles with Echo. While the Journal didn't say how the integration would work, the Ford-Echo partnership was designed to let you start your vehicle or tell you how much charge your electric car has without walking outside. There's no word yet on which automakers Google plans to partner with, but if it chooses the same route as its competitors and opts for an American automaker, Fiat Chrysler and Tesla are still up for grabs.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

 Google and Facebook are destined to wage a decade-long war for the future Matt Weinberger Oct. 9, 2016, 3:41 PM 23,286 facebook linkedin twitter email print Back in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his grand ten-year roadmap, showing the company's trajectory from now through 2026.  Here's that slide again, in case you missed it: Facebook It points the way to Facebook's ideal future: A world where everybody's connected to the internet, where we talk to artificially intelligent computers as if they were human, and — boldest of all —  where virtual reality goggles are as common as our smartphones, allowing us to connect with people across the world as intimately as if they were in the same room. Facebook moved the marker on this ambitious roadmap a little bit forward this week, with more details on how the social network will operate in its ideal virtual reality future. In a demo, Zuckerberg showed off "Social VR," using a combination of the Oculus Rift headset and a 360-degree camera to mash together virtual reality and the real world like never before. In Facebook's vision for the year 2026, the social network plays a key role in more, if not most, of the interactions you have with your fellow humans. It's a little creepy, given how much Facebook already permeates our personal lives, but it provides a fascinating glimpse of the radical changes coming to the technology we use.   Mark Zuckerberg takes a "modern family" selfie with his VR avatar, his wife Priscilla video chatting in on Messenger, and his dog Beast as shown on a 360-degree camera. Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg That's not to say it will be easy for Facebook.  Just this week, Google held its own big event. And while that presentation was ostensibly to introduce new hardware, it also gave us a glimpse of how Google is thinking about its own future — and the ways in which Facebook's 10-year strategy overlap with Google's. Their core businesses couldn't be more different — Facebook's efforts to break into search haven't yielded much result; Google's attempts to become a social network are pretty much Silicon Valley punchlines at this point. Yet in many important ways, Facebook and Google are already going punch-for-punch in a fight that won't be over any time soon. Fighting from the sidelines The most visible part of their fight: Google's YouTube is the undisputed ruler for web video. But Facebook has been working hard at undermining YouTube's supremacy by attracting more media brands and advertisers to its video offerings. But the more interesting competition is in the futuristic and far-reaching technology being developed by each tech giant.  Just this past week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is using artificial intelligence to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Facebook is investing heavily in AI to personalize its news feed, too. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Reuters/Stephen Lam Facebook's Oculus subsidiary may have sparked the sudden gold rush towards virtual reality, but Google isn't far behind with its Daydream View headset, also announced this week. With VR movies projected to be big business, Google doesn't want to let Facebook steal YouTube's lead in video advertising. Google's parent company Alphabet and Facebook are both making huge investments in connecting the world. Facebook is using self-piloting laser drones, and Google is using balloons, but they share a self-given mission of connecting underserved populations to the internet.  Alphabet's Project Loon delivers internet to underserved areas via a balloon suspended at a suborbital altitude. The Verge/Google X On all counts, these are very future-looking businesses. Artificial intelligence is a very young field, and virtual reality is a long ways away from hitting the consumer mainstream. Even those efforts to connect the globe have regulatory hurdles to overcome in many countries. It's early enough that these are all sidelines to what each company is really good at. But with a long enough timespan — say, 10 years — there are going to be winners in each field, and there are going to be losers. And each side is stockpiling as much engineering talent as it can to make sure that they're the ones who walk away from this. Daydream believer Ultimately, what this all comes down to is growth amid great technological change. Google and Facebook, both born in the weird period between the bursting of the first dot-com bubble and Silicon Valley's current startup boom, successfully navigated the transition from the PC to the smartphone. The way Google managed that change was largely thanks to Android itself: A smartphone operating system that had Google search and services baked in at every possible level, while also available on a whole range of low- and high-end phones for every possible demographic. Now, Android is the most popular operating system in the world, and Google profits. Mark Zuckerberg shows off Facebook's ultimate vision for what virtual reality glasses will look like by 2026. Facebook Facebook was slow transitioning from the PC to the smartphone, but quickly caught up and now sees the majority of its users and ad revenue on mobile.  But with the smartphone boom now grinding to a halt, the established businesses of the past decade are due for a shakeup and the hunt is on for the next big thing. Whatever it turns out to be — virtual reality, AI-powered assistants, or the like — Google and Facebook are both vying to repeat the Android trick and become indispensable to the next phase of technology. This isn't a battle that will be won with one product release, one new website design, or one app. It's a war that will be fought in fits and spurts in the years to come. But for the winner comes control over the future.  SEE ALSO: Google couldn't stop copying Apple, Amazon, and Facebook even if it wanted to NOW WATCH: Google’s new VR headset is ‘squishy and very comfortable’ — here’s what it’s like Loading video...

Follow TechnoBuffalo We expect our digital assistants to be smart, to set timers and organize schedules and provide answers to important questions. Like, does Bigfoot exist? Increasingly, our expectations for these assistants has become for them to act more human. For Google, that means giving its new Assistant technology a sense of humor. In a report from the Wall Street Journal, it’s revealed that Google hired writers from Pixar and the Onion in an effort to give Assistant personality. “Google wants to build an emotional connection with the user,” according to Gummi Hafsteinsson, product management director of Google Home. WSJ further expands on Hafsteinsson’s comments: Getting it right also requires paying attention to details such as latency—humans have no patience for it in conversation—and tone of voice, such as stressing the word “now,” when Assistant says, “Setting a timer for two minutes starting now.” Although assistants such as Siri and Alexa are becoming smarter, you’re very aware you’re talking to a robot with scripted responses. Google is trying to bridge the divide between human and AI by using humor as a way to create an emotional connection. Think of the movie Her as an example of what Google is hoping to achieve. Why a smarter Google Assistant matters… Google’s Assistant technology is at the core of the search giant’s software and hardware ambitions, which is why it’s important to create something that people can form a connection with. Assistant is crucial to both Google Home and its new Pixel smartphone, and it’s also available in Allo, the company’s new mobile messaging app. Source WSJ Topics #Google #Google Assistant Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Just recently, Google joined the competition with its Pixel XL handset. After going head to head with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, it’s about time for the Android device to be pitted against another formidable Android phablet, LG’s V20. LG’s V10 successor debuted to good reviews with its stellar specs and features. Let’s find out if the Pixel XL is worthy of being called a V20 rival. Performance As flagship devices, performance is expected to be top-notch for these two. The LG V20 is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHZ and the other two Kryo cores clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. By today’s standards, these specs are guaranteed to deliver high quality performance. However, Google may have the upper hand at this point, since its Pixel XL is powered by Qualcomm’s latest quad-core Snapdragon 821 chip (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHz and two more clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. Despite having very similar specifications, Qualcomm indicated on its website that the 821 chip is 10 percent better than the 820. This may not translate to a significant difference between the real time performance of the two devices, but Google’s phablet is known to provide a more seamless user experience than LG’s dual-screen phablet on paper.   Display When it comes to display, both handsets are rocking large touchscreen screens with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. The V10 successor has a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 513 ppi pixel density. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel XL comes with a smaller 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 534 ppi pixel density. Although the screen sizes and pixel densities of the two are dissimilar, both handsets render colors very well. Thus, there isn’t much difference in the display quality they project to the naked eye. The thing that makes the V20 stand out, however, is the inclusion of a secondary screen atop its primary display. Keeping the distinguishing feature found on its predecessor, the V20 also has a small 2.1-inch horizontal display that is dedicated solely for notifications, shortcuts and other app-specific features. This then ensures that the main screen’s real estate is optimally utilized for the primary user experience.  Camera Technology In this day and age, smartphone users are opting to buy devices that can match their instant photography needs. For this very reason, it’s clear that the V20 takes the cake when it comes to camera technology. LG’s handset is boasting a dual rear camera setup comprising a standard lens with a 16-megapixel lens and a wide angle lens with an 8-megapixel lens. The two lenses make up for a photography device that is comparable to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus dual-lens camera. Enhancing the user experience of the V20’s primary camera setup are the laser and phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, optical image stabilization and dual-LED flash. On the other hand, the Pixel XL’s camera is  a single lens with a 12-megapixel sensor, laser and phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. If it’s any consolation, the Pixel XL is armed with an 8-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, while the V20 only comes with a 5-megapixel front snapper.  Related Stories Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. Google Pixel XL — Which Is The Better Phablet? Apple iPhone 7 vs. Google Pixel - Which Is Better? iPhone 7 Plus vs. LG V20: Comparison Of Camera Technology Miscellaneous Other determining factors that could help consumers decide include the batteries, OS versions, onboard memory variants and other features. Google’s all-new phablet is powered by a non-removable Li-ion 3,450 mAh battery, while LG’s device houses a removable Li-ion 3,200 mAh battery. Android OS-wise, the LG V20 is considered the device that was the first to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Contrariwise, the Pixel XL is running the latest version of the Nougat OS, v7.1, and certain software features that are only Pixel-exclusive. Both handsets have fingerprint scanners. The Pixel XL comes in two internal memory options, 32 GB and 128 GB, without the advantage of having expandable memory via a microSD card slot. On the other hand, the V20 comes in 32 GB and 64 GB variants and it has a dedicated microSD card slot that can accommodate up to 256 GB of additional storage. The Pixel XL has Very Black, Really Blue and Quite Silver color options, whereas the V20 has Titan, Silver and Pink color variants to choose from. Finally, what sets the V20 apart from the Pixel XL and other phablets in the industry is its B&O Play certified 3.5mm headphone jack and its 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC technology and built-in HD Audio Recorder for unparalleled audio capabilities.  Which do you think is the better phablet between Google’s Pixel XL and LG’s V20?

By Chris Duckett | October 10, 2016 -- 23:33 GMT (16:33 PDT) | Topic: Legal The European Union regulator investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power has not extended its scrutiny to the tech giant's tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the bloc's antitrust chief has said. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to €13 billion in back taxes to Ireland, and Starbucks up to €30 million to the Dutch tax office, said Google is not on her radar for now. What's Hot on ZDNet Edward Snowden: Don't fear Trump, fear the surveillance state Why MacBook Pros don't need 32GB of RAM Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 How Linux can save small businesses (and old hardware) "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party, which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's £130 million back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010, when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she does not know when she will issue a decision, but said the case is a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. In May, reports suggested Google faced a fine in the order of €3 billion from the European Commission following three failed attempts to compromise with the tech giant over the six-year period of the investigation. The commission can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, which in Google's case would be a maximum possible sanction of more than €6 billion. The biggest antitrust fine to date was a €1.1 billion fine imposed on chip-maker Intel in 2009. Google has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. In April, the commission delivered its preliminary view on the matter, stating that Google has abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and network operators. "Based on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google's behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players, in breach of EU antitrust rules," Vestager said at the time. This follows the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) making a similar ruling in March against a Google appeal. Russia has stepped up its rhetoric against US software firms, drafting a new law requiring Russian government agencies to give preference to open source and to block US software from computer systems, citing security concerns. Google's Paris office was raided in May as part of the French government seeking €1.6 billion in back taxes. "The investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax," the prosecutor's office said at the time. Google has based its regional headquarters in Dublin, where corporate tax rates are lower than elsewhere in Europe.

Mello Jr. • LinuxInsider • ECT News Network Oct 10, 2016 4:07 PM PT Project Noto, one of Google's most ambitious undertakings ever, has reached a milestone. Noto now supports 800 languages and 100 writing scripts, the companies announced last week. Google and Monotype launched the open source initiative to create a typeface family that supports all the languages in the world, even rarely used languages. Both serif and sans serif letters with up to eight weights are supported, as well as numbers, emoji, symbols and musical notation. "Noto" is short for "no tofu." Outside the font world, tofu is something to eat -- but to insiders, it's those annoying rectangles that appear on the screen when a computer doesn't have a font to display the characters in a document or on a Web page. The name "Noto" conveys Google's goal of eliminating them. All Noto fonts can be downloaded for free. Keeping Information Alive Hundreds of researchers, designers, linguists, cultural experts and project managers around the world have been involved with Noto. Work on the Noto fonts is ongoing as new scripts are added to the Unicode Standard -- a character coding system designed to support the worldwide interchange, processing and display of written texts representing the diverse languages and technical disciplines of the modern world, according to the Unicode Consortium. Essentially, the standard aims to establish a unique combination of numbers for every character in every written language ever written. "The aim of the Noto project is to provide digital representation to all the scripts in the Unicode Standard," said Kamal Mansour, a linguistic typographer at Monotype. "That in particular is something that many different language communities could not afford to do on their own." Stones to Sand As happens with Google projects from time to time, Noto began as an internal project. "Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we're also very interested in keeping information alive," said Bob Jung, director of internationalization at Google. Google believes it's really important to preserve even dead languages, he added, and "without the digital capability of Noto, it's much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource." When adding languages to Noto, priority is given to widely used languages, but it's important to support other languages, too, even if no one is still speaking them, said Google Product Manager Xiangye Xiao. "There are some characters you can only see on stones," she explained. "If you don't move them to the Web, over time those stones will become sand, and we'll never be able to recover those drawings or that writing." Suit in the Closet Tofu isn't just an obstacle to language preservation -- it's an obstacle to business, as well. "Because there isn't a common font that works across all languages and use cases, you run into the problem of a default font in one culture not being acceptable for business use in another culture," said Paul Teich, a principal analyst with Tirias Research. "What Google has done is design a clean, modern, least-common-denominator business and education font across cultures and languages. It's the suit that always stays in your closet," he told TechNewsWorld. "It lets Google take its browser Chrome to any device and serve up a font that exists everywhere because they created it," added Teich. "It can become a lingua franca, simply because it has a character for every language." Aesthetically, the font is fairly basic, observed John Caserta, an associate professor at the Rhode Island School of Design. "A lot of free fonts lack character and risk," he told TechNewsWorld. "Graphic designers are going to want find a typeface that's more unique to create a brand for a company," Caserta said. "For websites that don't need a distinct look, these Noto fonts will work fairly well." John Mello is a freelance technology writer and contributor to Chief Security Officer magazine.

These alternatives will do the job Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 10:15 a.m. EDT October 11, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Samsung is halting production on the Galaxy Note 7 after replacement phones caught fire. WIBBITZ In this Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016, file photo, a Samsung Galaxy S7, left, and S7 Edge are displayed during the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2016 event on the eve of the Mobile World Congress wireless show, in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo: AP Photo/Manu Fernandez) At this point, one thing about the Galaxy Note 7 is very clear: Samsung's latest smartphone is unsafe. After a week of reports that replacement Note 7 phones were catching on fire from battery issues, Samsung is stopping production and asking all global retail partners to stop sales and exchanges for replacement Note 7s. If you have one, return the phone to your carrier or retailer for an alternate phone. USA TODAY Samsung adjusting Galaxy Note 7 production after fires But what should you get instead? Here are a few replacements worth considering. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge If you really love your Note 7's water resistance, great camera, wireless charging and crisp display, you should strongly consider the Galaxy S7 Edge ($749.99-$800). Samsung's top Galaxy S7 phone has a slightly smaller screen and lacks some of the Note 7's bells and whistles, namely the USB-C port, iris scanner and stylus support, but is as close as you'll find to the Note 7. It's an excellent phone, and unlike the Note 7, there have been hardly any reports of exploding battery issues. It is also cheaper than the Note 7, so you should get some money back from your carrier, too. REVIEWED The Best Android Smartphones of 2016 - Reviewed.com Smartphones Apple iPhone 7 Plus The new Apple iPhone 7 does not include a headphone jack.  (Photo: Richard Vogel, AP) If you're done with Samsung and want to switch, the iPhone 7 Plus ($769) is an enticing option. It has a large 5.5-inch display, improved camera and finally offers water resistance. It's not the perfect Note 7 replacement -- the battery does not last as long, the display is not as sharp and the water resistance on the Note is better than the iPhone. Oh, and there's no headphone jack. But it is the best iPhone on the market and a compelling alternative. Apple also has a free Android to iPhone app in the Google Play store called "Move to iOS" to help make the switching process easier. Google Pixel XL Google's new Pixel comes in a variety of sizes and colors.  (Photo: Google) If you have another phone you can use for a little bit, the Google Pixel XL ($769) may be the phone for you. Google's first smartphone will be out October 20, and like the other phones on this list, it has a 5.5-inch display, fast charging battery that promises nearly 7 hours of charge in 15 minutes, and unlimited storage for photos and videos on Google Photos. It runs the latest version of Android, version 7.1 Nougat, and even supports Google's new Daydream virtual reality platform, giving you a replacement for Samsung's Gear VR. Unlike the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL will be exclusive to Verizon. An unlocked option will be available from Google that works on the other major carriers, but according to Google's site, it is either out of stock or on a 5-6 week backorder. LG V20 LG V20  (Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) For those looking for an Android phone not made by Samsung, and can't wait for the Pixel, the LG V20 ($830 at AT&T) is a strong contender. It's 5.7-inch high resolution display matches the Note 7 and also features a speedy processor and dual cameras for improved pictures. It's not water resistant like the Note 7, but it does feature a replaceable battery, a rarity amongst high-end phones that still is appreciated. As with the Pixel, you're going to need to use a different phone for the time being. The LG V20 hits T-Mobile and Sprint on October 28 and will come to AT&T and Verizon, though a release date has yet to be announced. These are just a few of the many great phones available, including strong contenders from HTC, OnePlus and Huawei. Regardless of what phone you get, you should back up and return your Note 7 as soon as you can.

A piece this morning from The Wall Street Journal mentioned how Google and other companies working on intelligent voice assistants — like Amazon — are trying their best to make them as relatable and human-friendly as possible, and one tidbit reveals that Google has even gone as far as to hire writers from Pixar and The Onion to make that a reality… Per the story: To infuse personality into Assistant, Google employs writers who have worked on movies at Pixar and crafted jokes for the Onion, says Gummi Hafsteinsson, product-management director of Google Home. If they’re hiring writers from Pixar or The Onion, I’m still a bit confused why they haven’t given Assistant a proper human name like Siri or Alexa. I guess Google wants you to talk to all of its products as if they’re the replacement for the search box of old, so perhaps that’s part of what is keeping Google attached to the “OK, Google” hotword and the new “Assistant” name. It’s just odd that, at the same time, Google wants Assistant to be personable. We were on the ground at Google’s October 4th event earlier this month, and got a chance to try out Google Home for ourselves for the first time. It’s a nifty little device and definitely worth the price, but ultimately, it’s just an extension of the Google helper you’ve come to know and love in the form of a standalone always-listening device with an attached speaker. Personally, that’s something I’ve wanted for a long time. What do you think?

Archives director Lois Yorke says most recipes in the What’s Cooking? Food, Drink and the Pleasures of Eating in Old-Time Nova Scotia exhibit were found in the collections of private individuals.” The government of Hawaii has released a new digital archive for Kahoolawe. “The Hawaii government agency in charge of Kahoolawe, a former Navy bombing practice island off of Maui, has released a new online database of photos and documents illustrating the island and its archaeological artifacts.” Now available: a database of prehistoric human teeth. “Archaeologists have created a new database from the teeth of prehistoric humans found at ancient burial sites in Britain and Ireland that tell us a lot about their climate, their diet and even how far they may have travelled. In a paper, led by Dr Maura Pellegrini from the University of Oxford, researchers say that individuals in prehistoric Britain were highly mobile.” It looks like the data are within the paper, not clear if it’s available as a separate download / standalone thing. TWEAKS AND UPDATES The Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library and Museums has revamped its Web site (sounds like it’s been adding new content, too.) “The site includes the Hayes’ museum’s obituary index, the ability to search through the museum’s 90,000 books, manuscripts and images of the president and his family and educational programs and resources. [Kristina] Smith said site visitors can browse through the museum’s manuscript collections online, search the diaries and letters of President Hayes and look at political cartoons from the Gilded Age.” Google is promising the next iteration of Chrome won’t be such a memory hog. “The Chrome team working on V8, the part of the browser that runs the JavaScript programs that make websites tick, “significantly reduced the memory footprint” of websites like Imgur, Reddit, Twitter and The New York Times. The changes come in Chrome 55, due in December.” I have a 2GB Chromebox and a 4GB Chromebox. The 4GB is fine but the 2GB is getting tougher and tougher to use… USEFUL STUFF VERY cool! Stolen from Paul P – thanks Paul! How To Make a Map From Open Data Using a Spreadsheet. “There’s been an explosion of open data made available by all levels government, but much of it is still in a pretty raw form and can be hard to manipulate and visualize. However, Google Sheets provides some powerful data import functions that can automatically populate a spreadsheet from a data feed, and Geosheets adds mapping and geospatial functions to Google Sheets. So the two combined can allow you to make a map from open data very quickly and without downloading anything.” Google Scholar wonks, you’ll like this: Scraping Google Scholar to write your PhD literature chapter. “This post is about a prototype ‘network’ approach to finding papers using data from Google Scholar, hopefully pointing to what could be done with more open data. I was able to use a supervised program searching on Google Scholar to extract my data, but a scalable version of this tool would require open data.” AROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD Oh argh: YouTube recently did a content takedown worthy of Facebook. “There was reason to celebrate last week: the European Parliament adopted my report to update the EU’s export control laws for goods that are used for torture and the death penalty. I uploaded a series of videos on YouTube of the debate in the Parliament… Three hours later I found a notice in my inbox, which explained that one of the video’s in this playlist had been taken down.” Apparently Verizon wants to knock $1B off its purchase price for Yahoo after news of the hacking scandal surfaced. That’s a little over 20% the original price. “Yahoo is telling Verizon that a deal is a deal and that the telecom giant has no legal avenue to change the terms. Yahoo’s next board meeting is in two weeks but the two parties are continuing discussions.” SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES Techdirt: Senator Ron Wyden Says White House Is Required By Law To Reveal Details Behind Yahoo Scanning. “So, one of the things in the USA Freedom Act is a provision requiring that the White House declassify any ‘novel interpretations’ of the law in ordering surveillance. This was to avoid the situations, such as under the Section 215 program, where the intelligence community reads words to mean things differently than anyone else would read them. Now, given what we’ve learned so far about the Yahoo email scanning case and the fact that it clearly goes beyond what people thought the law enabled, it seems clear that there’s some interpretation somewhere that’s ‘novel.'” In fact, the Yahoo scanning scandal is having international repercussions. “Yahoo’s decision to scan clients’ email accounts at the behest of US authorities has prompted questions in Europe as to whether EU citizens’ data had been compromised, and could help derail a new trans-Atlantic data sharing deal.” RESEARCH AND OPINION Oh, thank goodness, because I might be doomed: Social media won’t affect your ability to concentrate: Study “New York: Frequent use of online social media does not lead to long-term problems with your ability to concentrate, says a new study. These modern communication tools do not, it seems, interfere with our primal instincts, such as long-term attitudes, time appreciation, and concentration, in the way that many critics have suggested in recent years, said the study published in the International Journal Social Media and Interactive Learning Environments.” Good morning, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 10, 2016 at 5:27PM $3,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. Many financial advisors would likely tell you to invest that amount in a low-cost index fund instead of buying shares of a single stock. However, $3,000 can blossom into over $120,000 faster than you might think. Let's take a look at two Chinese stocks -- Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP) -- that accomplished that in just over a decade. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu Baidu, the biggest search engine in China, went public at $27 per share in 2005. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 111 shares. After the stock's 10-for-1 split in 2010, you would have 1,110 shares -- which would be worth nearly $200,000 today. In hindsight, it seems like a no-brainer to invest in "China's Google." After all, the country already has more than 720 million internet users, which is more than double the U.S. population and accounts for about a fifth of the world's internet users. But at the time of its IPO, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was still active in China, and the bears doubted Baidu's ability to compete against the search behemoth. That all changed in 2010, when Google shut down its Chinese search engine after clashes with the government over censorship and allegations of email hacking. Baidu filled the void, became the dominant search engine, and built a Google-like ecosystem of websites and cloud-based apps to widen its moat. Baidu's annual revenue soared from $2.3 billion in 2011 to $10.2 billion in 2015. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with 9% growth this year and 22% growth in 2017. Baidu's earnings are expected to fall 18% this year due to higher investments in O2O (online-to-offline) services -- such as ride-hailing, food deliveries, mobile payments, and other services integrated into its mobile app -- but once those investments become accretive, Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound 53% next year. Ctrip.com Ctrip, the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China, went public in 2003 at $18 per share. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 167 shares. Following four 2:1 splits, you would own 2,672 shares, which would be worth nearly $126,000 today. Image source: Getty Images. Ctrip's growth was supported by a massive growth market: the newly affluent Chinese traveler. Total revenues of China's OTA market soared 46% annually to $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2016, according to iResearch. That rapid growth is mirrored in Ctrip's revenue, which rose 48% in 2015. That growth looks robust, but Ctrip's earnings growth was volatile over the past few years due to aggressive pricing wars with rivals like Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR). But last year, Baidu swapped its 25% stake in Qunar with Ctrip, making Ctrip a major investor in Qunar. That move, which strengthens Baidu's aforementioned O2O efforts, makes it pointless for Ctrip and Qunar to undercut each other's prices. Qunar is also expected to pivot toward smaller "tier 3 and 4" cities as Ctrip continues serving "tier 1 and 2" cities. The addition of the Qunar stake is expected to boost Ctrip's revenue by 76% this year, followed by 36% growth in 2017. The company is also expected to return to profitability next year after recording a net loss this year. With the competition now fading, Ctrip is well-poised to assert its dominance and widen its moat with new services. The key takeaway It takes lots of research and luck to find fast growers like Baidu and Ctrip, which both had to be held through very volatile times to book today's gains. But finding and holding these multibagger stocks can generate massive gains, in these cases turning investments of $3,000 into enough cash to buy a home.

A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. Google logo NurPhoto via Getty Images file José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. Related: Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. "We have looked into this case," the company told NBC News in a statement. "We have not received any monies from this user and we are canceling the outstanding AdWords balance." It's worth noting Google also has a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense.

The improvements come with Chrome 55 which is scheduled for December this year. The Chrome team that works on Google’s Javascript engine (V8) writes in a blogpost that websites using a lot of Javascript will consume a lot less RAM memory. As an example the Chrome team mentions websites such as Reddit, Twitter, Youtube and Imgur. In Chrome 54 these websites consume a relative large amount of memory which can cause a slow browsing experience on cheap PCs and laptops. Google claims that the improvements in Chrome 55 will provide a smoother user experience and components like ‘heap memory’ consume 50% less memory on average and ‘zone memory’ consumes less than 40%. Google also announced it’s working on optimizing Chrome for devices with less than 1GB of RAM.

I don't use Chrome (Google dropped support for 32-bit GNU/Linux systems. Also, I don't trust Google.), but I do occasionally need Chromium for certain websites. Everytime I launch Chromium, I go through my system's processes to kill whatever I can, since that's the only way I'll be able to run Chromium on only 2GB or RAM. It seems quite rare to me for commercial software developers to attempt to reduce the consumption of RAM. Rather, I typically see them increase the RAM consumption because they can. All we need now is for developers of other browsers to take notice. Although Firefox doesn't use too much RAM (compared to current versions of Chromium), I'm still not happy with what it does consume. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

After entering “RGB to Hex” in the search bar, Google returns the following: Screenshot taken by author on 10/10/16 Google returns the values for a light blue color by default, but you can drag the slider or move the color picker to choose any color you wish.

Volokh finds a series of unusual court cases that resulted in web pages being de-indexed by Google, making them unavailable to search or other services. In some cases, reputation management firms were apparently charging as much as $6,000 a month for the service. Google will generally de-index pages if it receives a credible report that the page contains pirated content or defamatory statements. The reports are available in a public archive, and the vast majority of them concern pirated content. The standard for a successful request can be somewhat complex, but a legal injunction against the offending party is typically sufficient to de-index a site, making it effectively invisible to Google searches. $6,000 a month to make a page disappear from Google Volokh seems to have uncovered a way of gaming that system, giving bad actors the power to de-index any site they want. In the cases he describes, plaintiffs file lawsuits against dummy defendants who immediately agree to the proposed injunctions against them. The cases never see trial, and in many cases, the defendants themselves seem not to exist — but they exist long enough to get a court-approved injunction that can be sent to Google to de-index the site. Volokh’s investigation turned up 25 different instances of the scam in roughly the past year, although none of the named defendants could be located. In once case, a firm was able to de-index a news article by filing an injunction against an offending statement in the comments section, thus pulling the entire page off Google’s index. The phony claims represent a small percentage of the overall notices, as it’s common for Google to receive well over 100 copyright takedowns in a single day. Still they suggest that some reputation management firms have become adept at gaming Google’s system, and the company may need to devote more resources to examining apparently legal injunctions. It also suggests the law shouldn’t place any unnecessary legal weight on the takedown notices, as some cases are currently threatening to do. "The questionable nature of many such injunctions is reason to further insist that platforms not be legally bound by them," Volokh concludes.

There are multiple ways to specify colors that work better with one application or another, and so converting between them can be yet another tedious step in the design process. Fortunately, Google Search has once again come to the rescue, offering an easy way to convert colors between various kinds of color values. A number of color values are used in various applications. RGB and CMYK are used in print, while hex is used primarily in web design. With RGB, each of the primary colors — red, green, and blue — has a value within a range of 0-255. The higher the number, the more of that primary color is present in the color being defined. Pure red would be listed as RGB (255, 0, 0). Pure black would have no primary colors, and so RBG (0, 0, 0,), and white would be all primary colors, or RGB (255, 255, 255). CMYK functions similarly to RGB except the color ranges define cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). Related: Google’s Play Store gets a major makeover Hex, on the other hand, is preferred by programmers because the color value is contained in one string and so is easier to copy and paste throughout code. Like RGB and CMYK, hex assigns a value to each primary color using a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal value. It’s a bit more complicated than RGB, in that the range runs from 00 to FF in hexadecimal notation, but suffice it to say that each hex value can map directly to an RGB value. In hex, pure red is represented as #ff0000, pure black as #000000, and pure white as #ffffff. If all of that’s confusing to you, then you’ll be particularly glad to see Google’s new tool. Basically, the tool lets you select a color and easily convert a color between the various color types. Type a color value into the Google search box, and you’ll be presented with a color chart representing the relevant color. Click on “Show Color Values,” and you’ll get a list of various color values to choose from. Sometimes, it’s the little things that can make a person’s life that much easier. In this case, Google isn’t changing the world with the introduction of a new tool or piece of technology, but they’re making one nuisance–converting between color values–a lot easier for people who do this kind of thing on a regular basis.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 10, 2016 at 5:27PM $3,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. Many financial advisors would likely tell you to invest that amount in a low-cost index fund instead of buying shares of a single stock. However, $3,000 can blossom into over $120,000 faster than you might think. Let's take a look at two Chinese stocks -- Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Ctrip (NASDAQ:CTRP) -- that accomplished that in just over a decade. Image source: Getty Images. Baidu Baidu, the biggest search engine in China, went public at $27 per share in 2005. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 111 shares. After the stock's 10-for-1 split in 2010, you would have 1,110 shares -- which would be worth nearly $200,000 today. In hindsight, it seems like a no-brainer to invest in "China's Google." After all, the country already has more than 720 million internet users, which is more than double the U.S. population and accounts for about a fifth of the world's internet users. But at the time of its IPO, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google was still active in China, and the bears doubted Baidu's ability to compete against the search behemoth. That all changed in 2010, when Google shut down its Chinese search engine after clashes with the government over censorship and allegations of email hacking. Baidu filled the void, became the dominant search engine, and built a Google-like ecosystem of websites and cloud-based apps to widen its moat. Baidu's annual revenue soared from $2.3 billion in 2011 to $10.2 billion in 2015. Analysts expect that growth to continue, with 9% growth this year and 22% growth in 2017. Baidu's earnings are expected to fall 18% this year due to higher investments in O2O (online-to-offline) services -- such as ride-hailing, food deliveries, mobile payments, and other services integrated into its mobile app -- but once those investments become accretive, Baidu's earnings are expected to rebound 53% next year. Ctrip.com Ctrip, the largest online travel agency (OTA) in China, went public in 2003 at $18 per share. $3,000 would have been enough to buy 167 shares. Following four 2:1 splits, you would own 2,672 shares, which would be worth nearly $126,000 today. Image source: Getty Images. Ctrip's growth was supported by a massive growth market: the newly affluent Chinese traveler. Total revenues of China's OTA market soared 46% annually to $1.05 billion in the second quarter of 2016, according to iResearch. That rapid growth is mirrored in Ctrip's revenue, which rose 48% in 2015. That growth looks robust, but Ctrip's earnings growth was volatile over the past few years due to aggressive pricing wars with rivals like Qunar (NASDAQ:QUNR). But last year, Baidu swapped its 25% stake in Qunar with Ctrip, making Ctrip a major investor in Qunar. That move, which strengthens Baidu's aforementioned O2O efforts, makes it pointless for Ctrip and Qunar to undercut each other's prices. Qunar is also expected to pivot toward smaller "tier 3 and 4" cities as Ctrip continues serving "tier 1 and 2" cities. The addition of the Qunar stake is expected to boost Ctrip's revenue by 76% this year, followed by 36% growth in 2017. The company is also expected to return to profitability next year after recording a net loss this year. With the competition now fading, Ctrip is well-poised to assert its dominance and widen its moat with new services. The key takeaway It takes lots of research and luck to find fast growers like Baidu and Ctrip, which both had to be held through very volatile times to book today's gains. But finding and holding these multibagger stocks can generate massive gains, in these cases turning investments of $3,000 into enough cash to buy a home.

One of the biggest announcements made at Google I/O earlier this year and at Google's hardware launch event this past week was Google Home, an always-listening wireless speaker that features the Google Assistant. The Google Assistant is similar to Amazon Echo's voice assistant named Alexa, as it can deliver search results, sports scores, calendar information, and a whole lot more. But in an effort to make the Assistant more personable to better compete with Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, Google has decided to hire joke writers from Pixar and The Onion. An anonymous reader quotes CNET: According to a Wall Street Journal report, comedy and joke writers from Pixar movies and the Onion are already working on making Google's upcoming Assistant AI voice service feel more loose and vibrant. The development of compelling voice AI will need to start drawing from deeper, more entertaining wells, especially as these home hubs try to have conversations all day long. Current voice AI like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa on the Echo try to engage with personality, and they even tell jokes (usually, bad ones). But, as these services aim to be entirely voice-based, like the upcoming Google Home hub, they'll need to feel more alive and less canned. Google Home debuts this November, and the upcoming Google Pixel phone, arriving in stores and online on October 20, is the first Google product featuring the new Assistant voice service. business google hardware ← Related Links → Talking 'Sofia' Robot Tells 60 Minutes That It's Sentient And Has A Soul Google Assistant and Google Home: Amazon Echo, But From Google Amazon's Alexa Virtual Assistant Can Now Order Millions of Prime Products For You Suicide Squad Fan Suing Studio For 'False Advertising' Over Lack of Joker Scenes Amazon Launches Updated Fire HD 8 Tablet Now With Alexa Voice Services Amazon Launches $2.5 Million Alexa Prize For College Students Building Bots Google Gets Serious About Home Automation: Unveils Google Home, Actions on Google and Google Wifi Submission: Google Hires Joke Writers From Pixar Movies and The Onion For Assistant Facebook Launches 'Workplace' So You Can Use Facebook At Work For Work This discussion has been archived.

While it won't be enough to tip my decisions, I've seen the Cortana easter eggs; despite not being a functionality, flavor can definitely increase a feature's appeal and, perhaps more importantly, branding. The industry is desperate to crack the code that causes nonsense like Over9000 to go pandemic, but this can have a similar effect (at a far tinier, subtler level). Sure, it can backfire if you half-ass it, but apparently they're serious enough to spend a little money. Whether the hires are well-chosen is left as an exercise for the flamewars.

This week, the Cut explores the allure of trying to achieve the impossible. According to Google, these are the top-ten searches for “How to get perfect _____.” How to get perfect skin How to get perfect eyebrows How to get the perfect body How to get perfect teeth How to get perfect curls How to get perfect hair How to get the perfect tan How to get the perfect butt How to get the perfect messy bun How to get the perfect abs I can’t say I’m surprised they all focus on physical improvements. As an SEO editor — an expert on how people search for things on Google — I frequently come across shocking, interesting, thought-provoking nuggets of information. When I set about researching women and how they think about perfection for the Cut, my experience was no different. The first search term, “how to get perfect skin,” yields 23.5 million articles. That’s almost as many as you get from searching “Kendall Jenner.” It’s three times as many results for “boosting confidence,” 16 times more than “maternity leave policies”, and nearly ten times as many as “how to stop living paycheck to paycheck.” On any given day, hundreds of thousands of women are reading about the latest Kardashian drama while also learning the right way to exfoliate (but only 538 are searching for “how to ask for a raise”). What does this say about women and how we view perfection? We’re constantly bombarded with stories about beautiful women with perfect everything, and often, those same women are sharing the nearly impossible steps they take to look that way. So, we read an article about Kendall Jenner, and then 18,000 of us Google how we can get her shiny hair. The flip side to searching for tips on how to achieve perfection is that thousands of women a day are also searching for inspiration about not being perfect. Whether looking for quotes about imperfections (14,800), songs about imperfections (4,400, but One Direction’s song “Perfect” gets over 200,000 searches), or personal essays about the struggle of being a perfectionist (40,000), we want to be reassured about our faults just as much as we want to correct them. Hence, “authenticity” and “vulnerability” are the top related search terms people also use when Googling “imperfect.” The association between searching “vulnerability” and “imperfect” is considered a “breakout,” meaning that search volume has increased by over 5,000 percent in the past year. Perhaps this is because when women are seeking reassurance about their flaws, they feel imperfections make them vulnerable and authentic, which are typically considered positive qualities. And topics related to insecurity — like “overcoming insecurity,” “how to stop being so insecure,” and “signs of insecurity” — garner nearly 10,000 searches every day. Nothing illustrates the push and pull of perfection online like Alicia Keys and her recent decision to forgo makeup at prominent events like the VMAs, the Democratic National Convention, and the BET Awards. Over the past six months, searches for her “no makeup movement” have increased by over 5,000 percent. She might not have the perfect skin (although it looks pretty beautiful to me), but she did tap into something in the Zeitgeist: Alicia Keys has nearly tripled her search traffic since June (where she appeared on the red carpet with no makeup for the first time), gathering interest from over 800,000 people per month. Maybe she knows it’s working, because she’s sticking to the no-makeup look — in the Voice premiere, she looked au naturel, freckles and all, and she recently appeared on the cover of Time Out New York makeup-free. Been working on being myself instead of other people’s idea of “perfect"! I’m feelin 💪🏽 and my best yet! https://t.co/eW5nrWKNrO— Alicia Keys (@aliciakeys) May 31, 2016 My high-school boyfriend once told me that my nose looked like a strawberry. I responded by telling him that was probably the meanest thing he’d ever said to me; I’ve always been self-conscious about my skin. I can’t remember how long it took after he told me my pores looked “like seeds” (he was charming) for me to want to correct my nose. By my last count, I have probably Googled “best pore minimizer” and “how to tell if you have rosacea,” at least 20 times, and those searches alone yielded 2.05 million pieces of reading material. Google holds up a magnifying mirror to our insecurities. We’re prone to searching for whatever we view in ourselves as imperfect, and we’re not afraid of specifics. It’s not just about “how to get perfect skin” — it’s also about “how to get smaller pores” and “how to get rid of acne.” And it doesn’t stop at “how to get a perfect body” — women then want to know “how to get thinner thighs” and “how to get rid of love handles.” Take this to a masochistic level and you get 1,600 people searching for “perfect body measurements.” There’s another explanation for all the searches about looking perfect, but it’s a bummer. Nearly 60,000 people search for “perfect girls” every day. What you get when you search those terms is porn. How many people search for “perfect guys” each day? A total of 12. In the whole world. Out of curiosity (or a need to find something positive amidst this negativity), I Googled “women search trends on Google.” I was hoping to find some credible articles on what women want to know from the internet, aside from things about perfection and looks. On the first page of Google (prime real estate), I found one story on how women spend more time on Google than men (but only in India), links to two shopping sites (Shopbop and Nordstrom), and four articles on fashion and hair trends. Then I tried another route: “What do women search for on the internet?” Some more international studies (from Nigeria this time) showed up, plus an article on the top-ten things women look for in a dating profile (cool), and a few articles that actually addressed what I was looking for, but they’re from 2005 and 2010 (ancient in internet-time). Maybe research outlets don’t think women’s search trends is an interesting topic, or perhaps Google thinks that fashion and dating are the most important things women search for online. But considering topics on “women empowerment” see nearly 21,000 searches daily, I’d say there are more things we care about besides fashion and beauty. Now if we could only stop Googling “how to get perfect skin.” Tags: googleseoperfect 10alicia keys Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top StoriesHillary Clinton Blames FBI Director James Comey for Her DefeatDon’t Try to Gaslight Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie About Trump’s RacismPink Reveals Second Pregnancy with Excellent Instagram Photo Most Viewed Stories People Are Wearing Safety Pins to Show Their Support for Marginalized Groups After the Election The Future of LGBT Rights Under President Trump Is Not Pretty Hillary Clinton Didn’t Shatter the Glass Ceiling.

The block was put in motion on Saturday, October 8, and initially targeted Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. Officials removed Google Drive from the list today after Google complied with a takedown notice from the government and removed the RedHack data from their servers. GitHub added to the blocklist today A few hours later, officials added GitHub to the list, after users uploaded the data on the source code hosting service in an attempt to avoid the local ban on cloud-based file sharing services. TurkeyBlocks, a service which keeps track of websites blocked in the country, says that Twitter has been intermittently inaccessible throughout Turkey over the weekend. According to several reports, in late September, RedHack, a hacking crew with a prodigious hacking history and ties to Turkey's communist political movement, had dumped online 20 GB of data. Turkey trying to hide AKP Twitter troll army? The group claims to have stolen the data from three email accounts belonging to Turkey’s Energy Minister, Berat Albayrak, who is also the son-in-law of the country's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to reports from Turkish journalists, the data dump contained details about a so-called "Twitter troll army," made up of AKP party members who viciously attacked anyone criticizing the country's president and the Turkish government, who has been contested in recent years following mass street protests. In July, during a failed military coup, Turkey also blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2014, Turkey blocked Twitter and YouTube after someone leaked an audio recording of President Erdogan, then only a Prime Minister, instructing his son to get rid of a large sum of money after police started investigating their family on corruption charges. #Turkey#RedHack#Erdogan#data dump#AKP subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news EU Comes Down on Exports of Cyber-Surveillance Tech Swiss Vote to Give Their Government More Spying Powers German Military Hacked Afghan Mobile Operator to Discover Hostage's Whereabouts German Politicians Targeted with Spyware over the Summer Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 Could Use Powerful Exynos 9 Chipsets Inside iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels Leaked Video Reveals Microsoft’s Discontinued Apple Watch Killer Microsoft Reveals How It Made Windows 10 “the Most Secure Windows Ever” New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked AsusWrt-Merlin Provides New Firmware for ASUS Routers - Version 380.63.2 Ultra-Rugged Kyocera DuraForce Pro Goes Official at Sprint Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Coming Soon to T-Mobile    Turkey blocks a suite of cloud-based file sharing services Related Apps Prevent Restore: Take privacy protecting to the extreme by making deleted files unrecoverable with the help of this streamlined and easy to use tool Free Firewall: Protects your computer against all kinds of threats, preventing suspicious applications from accessing the Internet and sending data back home Tom's FileZilla Password Recovery: A password recovery tool for the Filezilla FTP client that aims to come to the rescue in case you forgot or lost your login information RoboForm: Securely store and manage login information and bookmarks in a secure environment and access all the passwords directly from your browser Sandboxie: A useful application that will allow you to browse the Web securely, while keeping all your browser's functionality for active content Cryptomator: Keep your cloud-stored files as safe as possible with the help of this platform-independent and user-friendly encryption application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Reader comments Bug in Mirai Source Code Could Stop Some DDoS Attacks Dead in Their Tracks more on: Mirai i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Pixel and Pixel XL are Google's iPhone killers By Mark Wilson Published 1 month ago 100 Comments Tweet It may have been one of the worst kept secrets in tech launches, but today Google officially took the wraps off its Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. In terms of hardware it could be argued that there is nothing too spectacular here, but even if you ignore the (still very impressive) hardware side of things there are two features that directly take on Apple: Google Assistant to compete with Siri, and unlimited full-resolution photo backup. Unlike Google's previous Nexus range, the Pixel handsets carry no other branding -- these are the first phones designed and built inside and out by Google and Google alone. We already knew just about everything about the two handsets -- which neatly compete with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but now everything, and more, has been confirmed. As you would expect from a Google-produced phone, the Pixel duo both run the very latest version of Nougat -- Android 7.1. There are two sizes available, with the Pixel boasting a 5-inch, 1080p screen, and the Pixel XL a 5.5-inch, 1440p display. And the screen is the only real difference between the two phones, apart from the larger battery in the larger model. There is a very Apple-like approach to Pixel. Google says "we obsessed over every detail, from the industrial design to the user experience". It's straight from the Apple script; all that's missing is a reference to how 'beautiful' the hardware or user experience is. ALSO READ: Chromecast Ultra delivers 4K content for just $69 One thing Google is very keen to promote with Pixel and Pixel XL is the main camera, which is a 12.3MP affair with an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 micron pixels. The company says: The Pixel camera is not only the best smartphone camera we’ve ever made, it's the highest rated smartphone camera anyone has ever made. Our DxOMark Mobile score of 89 is a great example of what's possible when great hardware meets great software. Pixel puts cutting-edge computational photography in an ultra-fast and easy-to-use camera. Google has shared a video which is supposed to highlight the photographic capabilities of the Pixels, but it's not really much of a showcase: Pixel's camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light. Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. You can capture dramatic landscapes or make faces glow with new exposure controls. But Google is also touting Pixel as the first phone with Google Assistant built in. Triggered by saying 'OK, Google', this is essentially Siri on steroids: Say "Ok Google" or touch and hold the Home button and your Assistant is ready to help. Ask it for a brief update on your day or to play a video on YouTube. Look up traffic on the way home from work or when the nearest pharmacy closes. You can even say "show me my camping photos with Andrew" and it'll instantly display the photos you're looking for. Your Assistant can also offer help with what’s on-screen in any app. So if your friend texts you to meet up at a new restaurant, you can just say "navigate there". Check out the video to see what you can expect from the new handsets: Battery life is a key selling-point for any phone, and Google says that both Pixel models deliver a full day's usage. The 3490mAh battery in the Pixel XL should offer 32 hours of talk time, while the smaller Pixel's 2770mAh battery boasts 26 hours of talk time. There's fast charging support on both models, with just 15 minutes plugged into power yielding seven hours of usage. Both models also feature a rear-mounted fingerprint reader which is not only a security tool, but also doubles as a something of a trackpad -- notifications can be swiped away using the sensor. Pixel and Pixel XL will be available in 32 and 128GB models, with a choice of three colors -- Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue, with the latter option being US-only. The 32GB Pixel costs $649 or £599, while the 128GB model costs $749 or £699. The 32GB Pixel XL costs $769 or £719, and the 128GB model costs $869 or £819. The phones can be bought directly from Google in the US and UK, while those in the US can also hit their nearest Best Buy, or take advantage of Google's exclusive arrangement with Verizon. In the UK, the phones are available through EE or Carphone Warehouse. Pre-orders start now! 100 Comments Tweet Got News?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google cracks down on shooter of self-driving minivan photos By Ethan Baron / October 10, 2016 at 1:01 PM Standing in a Google employee parking lot, innovation consultant Mario Herger could see inside a fenced-off garage holding a number of Google’s self-driving cars. Herger was looking at the cars because he’s writing a book about self-driving vehicles. Then he noticed something unusual, he said, beyond the Lexus SUVs and prototype cars he’d expected to see: minivans. These were no ordinary minivans, as the self-driving-vehicle sensors installed on them showed. Herger, CEO of boutique innovation consultancy Enterprise Garage, was apparently viewing Google’s next step in fully autonomous vehicles, the fruits of a partnership with Fiat Chrysler announced in May. Herger shot photos, and posted them on the Enterprise Garage blog. Two hours later, he said, he heard from Google by email. The company said he’d had no authorization to be on Google property, from which he’d taken the photos, and demanded he take down his post and the photos. “Though I have not climbed any fences, broken into buildings, or saw any No Trespassing sign, I was on their property,” Herger told SiliconBeat. “So I complied.” Herger’s book on self-driving vehicles is to be published in German, then English. Herger had given website Electrek permission to publish the photos, so the images remained online after he took down his blog post. Electrek agreed to allow SiliconBeat to publish from among the photos on its site. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced a partnership to equip 100 Chrysler “Pacifica” minivans with self-driving technology. “The first six minivans arrived at one of Google’s facilities in Mountain View and the company already equipped two of them with sensor suites and installed mounting systems on others,” said an Electrek article Sunday. Google is reportedly expanding a carpooling service widely believed to be an attempt to go after Uber’s market — self-driving minivans could fit well with that business model in the future. Google, in an email, called the report by Electrek “inaccurate,” but did not specify in what way the company believes it to be wrong. Google is currently testing its fleet of 24 Lexus SUVs and 34 bubble-like prototype cars, both of which are regularly seen — with drivers on standby ready to take over — on Bay Area public roads. The company’s September report noted that its cars had collectively passed the two-million-mile mark while in autonomous mode.     Photo: Purported Google self-driving minivans in Mountain View (courtesy of Electrek) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Chrysler, Elektrek, Enterprise Garage, fiat chrysler, Google, minivans, Pacifica, self-driving   More Posts in Big Tech Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016   Google Search to provide federal, state election results November 7, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       Richard Birecki Glad to see protective of their IP — Here’s an interesting column on how it will affect real estate prices. http://me.richtrek.com/2015/09/why-buying-real-estate-in-los-angeles.html interesting theory, agree or disagree     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more… Grubhub CEO faces backlash for anti-Trump message to… Facebook glitch tells users they’re dead Mark Zuckerberg: Idea that fake news on Facebook influenced… Facebook to stop some ads that exclude races     Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2016 Bay Area News Group.

SUBSCRIBE Google labels your links, such as ‘footer’ or Penguin-impacted Google's manual action team has access to look at a page's link labels and may use that to dig deeper into the site's activities. Barry Schwartz on October 10, 2016 at 2:23 pm More In the A conversation with Google’s Gary Illyes (part 1) podcast at Marketing Land, our sister site, we learned that Google adds labels to your links. These labels can add classifications or attributes to the link, including whether the link is a footer link, whether it’s impacted by the latest Penguin update, whether it’s disavowed or other categorizations. A link can have multiple labels that make up the value and meaning of that link, which ultimately helps Google determine how to rank the related documents on the web. Google’s manual actions team may look at these labels to determine if they should dig deeper into the site’s links and add a manual action penalty to the site or not. Although, Illyes added, he doesn’t do much work with that specific team, so he isn’t too aware of their daily processes. In addition, Illyes listed three types of labels one might find on a link: “Penguin real time,” which would be the new Penguin algorithm; “footer” links, which would help Google determine how important the link is — i.e., it being in the footer versus the main content; and “disavow” — so if a link is in the disavow file, it will also be labeled as such for that site. There are many more link labels, but he only shared these three. Here is the audio embed of just this section: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: Is there some sort of flag that happens automatically. So that the manual action team is notified that, hey, there is a devalue going on here by Penguin? Gary Illyes: I don’t work much with the manual actions team, but to the best of my knowledge, there is no flag that said that they have; they can look at the labels on the on the links or a site gets. Basically, we have tons of link labels; for example, it’s a footer link, basically, that has a lot lower value than an in-content link. Then another label would be a Penguin real-time label. If they see that most of the links are Penguin real-time labeled, then they might actually take a deeper look and see what the content owner is trying to do. Danny Sullivan: You were talking about how Penguin is looking and identifying things and to think of it as part of like a link label. So, like Google is looking at things like, OK, I know this is a footer link or this is a content link or this is a Penguin link. So tell us more about that. Gary Illyes: So, if you think about it, there are tons of different kinds of links on the internet. There are footer links, for example. There are Penguinized links, and all of these kinds of links have certain labels internally attached to them, basically for our own information. And if the manual actions team is reviewing a site for whatever reason, and they see that most of links are labeled as Penguin real-time affected, then they might decide to take a much deeper look on the site and see what’s up with those links and what could be the reason those links exist — and then maybe apply a manual action on the site because of the links. Barry Schwartz: Which is why Google still recommends you disavow links, because I guess if a manual action team sees all these labels on it, and they look at the disavow file, and they say, hey this SEO or this webmaster [is] aware of these links and they’re going ahead and trying to take no responsibility… Would these labels show up if the links are disavowed, or they probably wouldn’t? Gary Illyes: So disavow is again, basically, just a label internally. It’s applied on the links and anchors. And then you can see that, as well. Basically, you could have like a link from, I don’t know, WhiteHouse.gov, and it has labels Penguin RT, footer and disavow. And then they would see that — they would know that someone or the webmaster or content owner is actively tackling those links. You can listen to part one of the interview at Marketing Land.

SUBSCRIBE Google Penguin looks mostly at your link source, says Google When we asked Google's Gary Illyes about Penguin, he said SEOs should focus on where their links come from for the most part, but they have less to worry about now that Penguin devalues those links, as opposed to demoting the site. Barry Schwartz on October 10, 2016 at 3:22 pm More Here’s another nugget of information learned from the A conversation with Google’s Gary Illyes (part 1) podcast at Marketing Land, our sister site: Penguin is coined a “web spam” algorithm, but it indeed focuses mostly on “link spam.” Google has continually told webmasters that this is a web spam algorithm, but every webmaster and SEO focuses mostly around links. Google’s Gary Illyes said their focus is right, that they should be mostly concerned with the links when tackling Penguin issues. Gary Illyes made a point to clarify that it isn’t just the link, but rather the “source site” the link is coming from. Google said Penguin is based on “the source site, not on the target site.” You want your links to come from quality sources, as opposed to a low-quality source. One example Gary revealed was his looking at a negative SEO case submitted to him, and he said the majority of the links were on “empty profile pages, forum profile pages.” When he looked at those links, the new Penguin algorithm was already “discounting” those links, devaluing those links. “The good thing is that it is discounting the links, basically ignoring the links instead of the demoting,” Gary Illyes added. Here is the audio snippet: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: You also talked about web spam versus link spam and Penguin. I know John Mueller specifically called it out again, in the original Penguin blog post that you had posted, that you said this is specifically a web spam algorithm. But every SEO that I know focuses just on link spam regarding Penguin. And I know when you initially started talking about this on our podcast just now, you said it’s mostly around really really bad links. Is that accurate to say when you talk about Penguin, [that] typically it’s around really, really bad links and not other types of web spam? Gary Illyes: It’s not just links. It looks at a bunch of different things related to the source site. Links is just the most visible thing and the one that we decided to talk most about because we already talked about about links in general. But it looks at different things on the source site, not on the target site, and then makes decisions based on those special signals. I don’t actually want to reveal more of those spam signals because I think they would be pretty, I wouldn’t say easy to spam, but they would easy to mess with. And I really don’t want that. But there are quite a few hints in the original, the old Penguin article. Barry Schwartz: Can you mention one of those hints that is in the article? Gary Illyes: I would rather not. I know that you can make pretty good assumptions. So I would just let you make assumptions. Danny Sullivan: If you were making assumptions, how would you make those assumptions? Gary Illyes: I try not to make assumptions. I try to to make decisions based on data. Barry Schwartz: Should we be focusing on a link spam aspect of it for Penguin? Obviously, focus on all the “make best quality sites,” yada-yada-yada, but we talk about Penguin as reporters, and we’re telling people that SEOs are like Penguin specialists or something like that — they only focus on link spam — Is that wrong? I mean should they? Gary Illyes: I think that’s the the main thing that they should focus on. See where it is coming from, and then make a decision based on the source site — whether they want that link or not. Well, for example, like I was looking at the negative SEO case just the yesterday or two days ago. And basically, the content owner played hundreds of links on empty profile pages, forum profile pages. Those links with the new Penguin were discounted. But like if you looked at the page, it was pretty obvious that the links were placed there for a very specific reason, and that’s to game the ranking algorithms. But not just Google’s but any other ranking algorithm that uses links. Like if you look at a page, you can make a pretty easy decision on whether to disavow or remove that link or not. And that’s what Penguin is doing. It’s looking at signals on the source page. Basically, what kind of page it is, what could be the purpose of that link ,and then make a decision based on that whether too discount those things or not. The good thing is that it is discounting the links, basically ignoring the links instead of the demoting. So in general, unless people are overdoing it, it’s unlikely that they will actually feel any sort of effect by placing those. But again, if they are overdoing it, then the manual actions team might take a deeper look. You can listen to part one of the interview at Marketing Land.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Kirk McMaster no longer Cyanogen CEO, controversial exec’s replacement still unknown By John Hoff - October 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Kirk McMaster, the controversial and outspoken head of Cyanogen Inc. is no longer head of the said tech company – this after leading Cyanogen in a bid to ultimately take down Google. He famously said that his aim was to make Cyanogen free of Google, but it looks like that won’t be happening, at least not under his leadership. Some tech pundits noticed today that McMaster changed his official job title of his LinkedIn account to “Executive Chairman.” While that still sounds impressive to our mortal ears, the title is actually a pretty vague one, and it can mean that he’ll be given some sort of high-level organizational responsibility, but the big idea is that McMaster won’t take the lead role in product and company strategy, as well as day to day operations of Cyanogen. It can be remembered that some inside sources gave information to the press about Cyanogen possibly lying about the number of users they have in the times they were looking for investors and in the marketing build-up to putting out Cyanogen OS. The number bandied around was “50 million users,” but the insiders say it was closer to around 3 million. And McMaster was the face that people knew behind the push of Cyanogen OS to make it big in the industry. No official announcement has been made yet, but we expect that to come soon. No possible replacement has been discussed, so we will have to wait until this piece of news becomes official. As of now, the Cyanogen Inc. website still lists McMaster as CEO.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close 123rf.com Salesforce still considering bid for Twitter, but its shareholders resist Reuters Oct 10, 2016 (…) 123rf.com Updated at 3:40 p.m. Salesforce.com Inc. is still deliberating whether it should make an offer for Twitter Inc. in the face of resistance from Salesforce shareholders over the strategic merits and valuation of such a deal, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Twitter shares have lost as much as a third of their value since Oct. 5 on concerns the company has attracted less interest from potential acquirers than previously envisaged. It now has a market capitalization of $12.3 billion after its shares fell 11.5 percent on Monday to close at $17.56. Salesforce is deliberating whether it is worth making a lowball offer for Twitter in the coming days based on Twitter's stock performance and any news of other bidders, the people said. Other potential acquirers such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walt Disney Co. have backed away from making offers for the Internet company, the people said. There may however be other companies contemplating offers for Twitter whose identity has not yet been reported, some of the sources suggested. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Salesforce declined to comment while Twitter, Google and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters previously reported that Twitter aimed to conclude deliberations about selling itself by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software. Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. A potential acquisition of Twitter has weighed down Salesforce's stock since news broke on Sept. 23 that it was vying for Twitter. Its shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday after a weekend report by Bloomberg News suggested Salesforce was unlikely to make an offer. Some analysts and investors have questioned why Salesforce would need to own Twitter, when it already licenses the Twitter "firehose" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. At Salesforce's annual client conference last week, Benioff said Salesforce considers buying many companies but maintains discipline, and wished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey "well." These comments tamped out expectations that Salesforce would be an aggressive bidder for Twitter. Since its founding a decade ago, Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. ____________ Our earlier story, by Reuters, posted at 1:49 p.m. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Shares of Twitter Inc. slumped more than 13 percent in premarket trading on Monday after a weekend Bloomberg report that the social media company was unlikely to receive any bids. Salesforce.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Walt Disney Co., which had worked with banks on a potential acquisition, are unlikely to proceed, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. Twitter had planned to hold a board meeting with outside advisers on Friday to discuss a sale but canceled, Bloomberg reported, citing one person familiar with the matter. Twitter shares plunged about 20 percent over the final two days of last week after technology website Recode reported that Google, Disney and Apple were not interested in buying the company, which put itself up for potential sale in September. Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter, but stopped short of saying the company would make a bid. Twitter's stock, which closed at $19.85 on Friday, are trading at $17.19, down $2.66, about an hour before markets close in New York. At that price, the company has a market value of $12.03 billion, compared with almost $53 billion at its peak in December 2013. Twitter, struggling with stagnant user growth and continuing losses, had told potential acquirers it wanted any deliberations on a sale to conclude by the time it reported third-quarter results on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Many investors and analysts believe that Twitter, co-founded and run by Jack Dorsey, does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired.

Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($A20 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Ms Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($A210 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Ms Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Ms Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days - something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world - Apple - has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that its brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. Sabrina Ellis, Google director of product management, talks about the colors of the new Google Pixel phone. Photo / AP Continued below. Related Content Samsung suspends production of Note 7, problems deepen Samsung suspends production of Note 7 Video Watch: Google takes on rivals with Pixel phone But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones - despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 - Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn't study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an e-mail. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. "We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement. There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem." - Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Google, Monotype release all-encompassing Noto typeface Published on 7th October 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 4  Comments News Google's Noto project aims to eliminate 'tofu,' the 'missing glyph' boxes, with support for 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. Google and Monotype have jointly announced the release of one of the most wide-reaching typography projects in history: an attempt to create a single typeface family encompassing all languages. Dubbed Noto, the aim of Google and Monotype's new typeface is simple: no more tofu, the latter referring to the 'missing glyph' boxes you'll see when your chosen typeface does not have the symbol requested by a document. Noto, by contrast, looks to have every symbol you could possibly need: over the past five years, the two companies have worked to add support for 800 languages and 100 writing scripts, all with a harmonious look-and-feel, plus numbers, symbols, musical notation, and the rapidly-growing collection of 'emojis.' 'We are passionately dedicated to type and helping to advance the use and adoption of type across many cultures, languages and geographies. We are thrilled to have played such an important role in what has become one of the most significant type projects of all time,' crowed Monotype president and chief executive Scott Landers at the unveiling. 'The combination of Monotype’s type expertise and Google’s innovation has proven to be a productive relationship and we look forward to continued collaboration that helps advance the use of type to new places.' Some of the work, which has taken a team of hundreds of researchers, designers, linguists, cultural experts, and the inevitable project managers five years so far, has been more in-depth than others: adding support for the Tibetan language, for instance, saw a team of researchers analyse a vast trove of writing and other source material followed by a quality control pass from members of a Buddhist monastery who spend their time studying and copying Tibetan manuscripts. 'Even though we prioritise widely used languages, we still want to support other languages, even if there are no people still speaking them,' explained Google's Xiangye Xiao of the project's scope. 'There are some characters you can only see on stones. If you don’t move them to the web, over time those stones will become sand and we’ll never be able to recover those drawings or that writing.' The Google Noto family is available for free under the Open Font Licence (OFL), from the official website. Its first public release came in July 2014, but it has recently added additional languages and re-licensed from the Apache Licence 2.0 to the Open Font Licence.

Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batterie were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum -- and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 percent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 percent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 percent to leave it with market share of 12 percent.   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 percent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 percent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note.

The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google wants assistant to be more personable than the likes of Alexa and Siri, and that means an improved sense of humour. While the aforementioned apps will tell you a joke, or offer the occasional witty retort, Google seemingly wants Assistant to raise the bar for the Google Home speaker. Related: Google Home - Your complete guide This is likely be to further its goal of users developing “an emotional connection” with Assistant. A little humour, it seems, could go a long way. Google introduced us to the latest version of Assistant at its Pixel event last week. It is available within the new Allo chat app, but the most exciting application is the voice-powered, Amazon Echo-rivalling Google Home device. Home will go on sale in the United States next month for $129, undercutting the $179 Echo. It is currently available to pre-order. Just like the Echo, it can control music streaming, search the web for information, command smart home devices and access the calendar. Google believes the conversational Assistant will make Home a better option than Alexa.

These include playback entertainment throughout the home and searching Google for any request, no matter how trivial, all via voice-control. The design of the speaker-like device is minimal and futuristic-looking but not overwhelmingly so, and can be matched with consumers’ interiors as it comes in seven different shades that vary from copper to purple and monochrome. It’s petite and circular in size, around the size of a large hardback book, and the bottom half is detachable, meaning users can also change the color when they feel like it, depending on their mood. It only contains one concealed button and no switches or screens, ensuring the focus is on the voice-control function, however it has a touchscreen surface that can be used for volume control. There’s also a ‘mic mute’ button for privacy, should someone be able to overhear a restaurant suggestion for a family member’s birthday celebration. The voice-controlled home device is constantly on the lookout for commands, ready to serve the user at any given moment and as soon as it hears, “OK Google,” from a pre-recorded, registered member of the family. Once connected, Google’s Assistant, which is built into the device, can answer questions, according to Google in the form of a “two-way dialogue,” and also control other connectable devices around the space. It also plays music, podcasts or different radio stations from compatible services like Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music and Pandora. Watch the intro video below: Now that the Google Home collection is all but complete, it will be interesting to see how consumers take to it, and how it competes with Apple’s Home. The device is now available to pre-order via the designated Google Home website.

It’s obvious you’re getting information from a machine that lacks its own personality, which is why both Apple and Google have gone to such lengths to make Siri and Google Now entertaining in some form. Google’s upcoming Assistant AI voice will have something a little special, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. The company has hired comedy and joke writers who worked on Pixar movies and the satire site The Onion in order to breathe life into the artificial intelligence assistant, to make it feel more personable. It’s a unique effort and the first time we’ve heard of a company hiring writers for their assistants. As more devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other connected devices make their way into our living room with the promise of information at just the sound of a keyword, Google has to find a way to make its Assistant pleasurable to converse with and easy to use. We’ll find out if that extra boost from paid writers pays off for Google on October 20th when Google’s Pixel phones debut. local_offer    Google Assistant   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (8) stars Further Reading Third-party Google Assistant tools coming IFTTT now includes a Google Assistant Channel Google Assistant vs Siri How to use Google Assistant Google Assistant has a trivia game stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 2 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Five Galaxy Note 7 alternatives Eric Abent - Oct 10, 2016 23 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It would seem that the Galaxy Note 7 just can’t put its problems behind it. With Samsung rumored to be halting production on the handset after reports of a fresh round of battery problems and all of the major US carriers now offering to swap the phone out for something different, Galaxy Note 7 owners are in a tough spot when it comes to selecting a new phone. To help make the transition a little smoother, here are five handsets (in no particular order) you can pick to replace your Galaxy Note 7. 1. iPhone 7 Plus Yes, the idea of making the jump to Apple might be unthinkable to some Android users, but as someone who switches between both operating systems on a whim, it’s not nearly as bad as some would have you believe. For starters, the iPhone 7 Plus has one of the best cameras available on a smartphone at this point in time, and all of Google’s apps play nicely with iOS. It doesn’t matter how deep in Google’s ecosystem you are, you can continue using services like Play Music, Docs, Gmail, and Chrome on iOS without missing a beat. In fact, the first time I jumped between Android and iPhone, I was surprised by how relatively seamless the transition was. If you’ve been wondering what you’ve been missing on the iOS side of things, this might be a good opportunity to see how the other side lives. Additionally, with the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll be getting a phone that’s similar in size to the Galaxy Note 7. Still not convinced? Our review might further sway you to the dark side. 2. Galaxy S7 Edge If you’d rather stick with Android – and more specifically Samsung – then the Galaxy S7 Edge should serve as a solid replacement for your Galaxy Note 7. While it doesn’t come equipped with an S-Pen, it does have a similar screen size, and its excellent internals mean it’ll be a long time before this phone is made obsolete. Perhaps best of all, it’s compatible with the micro USB accessories you likely already have, delaying the changeover to USB-C a little longer – not that USB-C is a bad thing, of course. Quite the contrary, USB-C is great, but changing over is always a hassle. If you don’t mind a smaller phone, the standard Galaxy S7 earns an honorable mention here. For those who aren’t crazy about the curved display that adorns both the Note 7 and S7 Edge, the Galaxy S7 is the clear choice of the three, especially considering it may be the last phone without a curved display that Samsung releases for some time. Read through our review of the Galaxy S7 Edge for more! 3. Google Pixel XL On the other hand, those who want to avoid Samsung entirely may want to have a look at the Google Pixel XL. Google is looking to make a big splash in the smartphone market with its new Pixel offerings, and the Pixel XL is shaping up to be a solid device. Whether its the camera that scored a DxOMark Mobile rating of 89 (the highest of any smartphone camera) or the deep Google Assistant integration, Google is definitely looking for a standout phone here. With that in mind, the Pixel and Pixel XL will only be sold in Verizon stores and through Google’s online store (note that you can purchase unlocked Pixels through Google). Off-contract pricing is as high as any other smartphone, though there are monthly financing options available if you’d prefer to go that route. Just as well, the phone isn’t expected to ship out until October 20, so you may need to fall back to an older device while you wait for your Pixel XL to arrive. We have some early impressions on the Pixel and Pixel XL to share, so check it out if Google’s incoming phone has piqued your interest. 4. LG V20 The LG V20 is another phone that has yet to be released, but it has one major advantage over some of the other phones on this list: it ships with Android 7.0 Nougat, bringing you up to speed with the most recent version of Android out of the box. Couple that with the large display LG is including in this package, and you should have a pretty decent alternative to the Note 7. This has the same problem as the Google Pixel XL, however, in that it’s not actually available yet. This means that you’ll have to either stick with your current Note 7 for a couple more week or jump back to an older phone to fill the gap while you wait for the V20 to release. If that sounds like something you can deal with, though, have a look at our hands-on with the device to see early impressions. 5. Galaxy Note 5 This may well be the best choice for disappointed Galaxy Note 7 owners, even though this phone is the oldest one on the list. Despite being a year old, the Galaxy Note 5 can still hold its own in terms of hardware, and it will be twn in terms of hardware, and it will be the most familiar to Note 7 users. Not looking to sacrifice the S-Pen? The Galaxy Note 5 might be the phone for you. If you don’t care that much about having the absolute best that’s currently available and don’t want to part ways with the features that make a Galaxy Note a Galaxy Note, then the Note 5 is probably a safe bet. Have a look at our Galaxy Note 5 review for more – even though some time has passed, most of what we had to say remains true today.

The technology giant has invited building companies to pitch to construct the project, which was approved in 2013 and later shelved for a more ambitious development, the people said, asking not to be identified because the process is private. Google aims to start building the headquarters before the end of next year, the people said. Spokeswomen for Google and Argent LLP, the developer of the site, declined to comment. Two months after Google won approval for the 920,000 square-foot building next to King’s Cross railway station, the company scrapped the plans, which included a roof-top running track, in favor of building “something even better,” Joe Borrett, Google’s head of real estate and construction, told The Telegraph newspaper at the time. The decision to start searching for a contractor for the project underlines London’s enduring appeal to technology companies even after the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union. Apple Inc. agreed to lease 500,000 square feet at the Battersea Power Station development on the River Thames last month. The company has since leased two other buildings in the district. Workers began moving into 6 Pancras Square in June and a second Google office at the King’s Cross Central site was approved by Camden Council in February.

X EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager European Commission’s antitrust chief says Alphabet unit not on her radar for now Mon, Oct 10, 2016, 20:40 EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager also defended the slow pace of the commission’s antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. Photograph: Cyril Byrne         EU regulators who are investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power have not extended their scrutiny to its tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the EU’s antitrust chief said on Monday. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to €13 billion in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks up to €30 million to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. “So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one,” Ms Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google’s £130 million back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Ms Vestager also defended the slow pace of the commission’s antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. – (Reuters)       Topics: Apple tax Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Personal Finance Government raises health insurance stamp duty levy by 10% Retail & Services Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy Other Sports Conor McGregor makes UFC history at Madison Square Garden Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Security camera firm eyes more success in Europe 14:03 Russia ‘raider attack’ case makes it to the High Court 11:00 Facebook bug ‘kills’ millions of users, even Mark Zuckerberg 10:52 Trump success has sparked major sell-off in bonds 08:00 World of finance awaits Trump presidency 07:30 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Sticking with one email address is a security risk ADAM TURNER Last updated 08:29, October 11 2016 Having a separate free webmail account for services which you think are likely to leak your email address helps to protect you from spammers and hackers. Reusing passwords is a major security risk but another sensible precaution is to avoid using the same email address for everything. Creating extra addresses or aliases can be a hassle, but it certainly makes it more difficult for hackers to bring you down. One simple way to do this is to use a separate free webmail account – from the likes of Microsoft, Google or Yahoo! – to sign up for services which you think are likely to leak your email address to spammers and hackers. Something like ilovetoshop92@gmail.com might do the trick, ensuring you only use it when signing up for cut-rate online shopping sites. READ MORE: * Google will now write email replies for you * Smartphone email notifications 'a toxic source of stress * Five hints and tips for Gmail To make life easier, you might forward this account to your primary email address but filter those emails into a sub-folder or colour code them so you can easily tell where they came from. This way if you receive an email to that address regarding a supposed unpaid tax bill, overdue electricity account or request to reset social media passwords you can safely ignore it – knowing that it's a scammer trying to trick you. Most online scams take a shotgun approach but some are targeted particularly at you, especially if you run a business. Another way to stay safe is to use different email addresses for all your important online services. Managing a dozen webmail accounts is obviously a hassle, an easier way to go about it is to create alias email addresses which funnel into your primary inbox, once again using sub-folders or colour coding so they're easy to spot. Think of it like using a PO Box to receive your snail mail, so you don't have to tell the world where you live. Ad Feedback Different email services support aliases in different ways, so it's worth checking the advanced settings. Some let you choose any login, such as FakeEmailAddress@YourDomain.com, while others even let you choose from a range of domain names so you can use FakeEmailAddress@SomeOtherDomain.com. Unfortunately Google isn't this flexible, if you're fred@gmail.com you can use fred+alias@gmail.com which helps in some circumstances but doesn't mask your true email address. This trick also makes it easier to spot phony emails, as emails which are sent to the wrong alias are clearly bogus – for example an Amazon password reset sent to ebay@yourdomain.com is certainly fake, and vice versa. The same goes for banking-related emails which aren't sent to the unique email address you only use with that bank. Once again it's important not to use these aliases elsewhere. Using aliases also helps protect you against targeted attacks, because hackers can't break into an account which doesn't exist – particularly useful for cloud storage and backup services which contain sensitive information. Your primary email address might be fred@yourdomain.com, but hackers targeting you will have no luck breaking into your Dropbox account if it's under dropbox@yourdomain.com or something more obscure which you never reveal publicly. You might think that having a strong password and using two-factor authentication are enough to keep you safe – and they certainly help – but by using a unique alias you're also foiling social engineering attempts to trick tech support into resetting your password, or attempts to hijack your mobile number to intercept two-factor codes.  - Sydney Morning Herald Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Digital Living story: Magic tricks on YouTube are in danger of killing the art, warns its inner circle Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Trump's social media 'in crowd' Kiwi behind self-piloting drones Facebook tells users they're dead Facebook influenced election?

Google is making a big strategy shift with the Pixel and Google Home. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 10, 2016 at 2:32PM Image source: Google. The first thing I do when I purchase a new smartphone is go to the app store and download a bunch of apps made by Google -- Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and Google Drive, to name a few. Even on an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, I prefer to use a lot of the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary's services. And Googldless of what platform you're using. Google's advertising business model relies on reaching the widest possible audience to maximize revenue. But Google's newest software -- a virtual assistant simply called Google Assistant -- is available only on the new hardware Google unveiled at the beginning of the month. (A less robust version of the software is available through its new chat app Allo as well.) The decision represents a major shift in strategy for Google that bears further examination. An AI-first world At the top of Google's keynote earlier this month, CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience, "We are moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world." The user interface has moved from desktop PCs, to the web, to mobile, and now you can literally have a conversation with your computer. Whether that computer is a PC, phone, watch, or some cross between a speaker and a HAL 9000 doesn't matter. There are a growing number of AI assistants: Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Viv, and now Google Assistant. Apple used Siri to further differentiate the iPhone, and clandestinely break its reliance on Google search. (Siri uses Bing for search results.) Microsoft introduced Cortana to differentiate Windows Mobile, but it's since brought the AI to several platforms, including Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Amazon.com introduced Alexa as part of its Echo speaker, and when the product took off, it extended it to its Kindle Fire tablets. How else could Google compete? Google finds itself competing against a range of competitors, all of which have established user bases: Siri on iPhones, Cortana on Windows PCs, and Alexa on Echo and Kindle. Google's ability to overcome the competition simply through releasing another app in the Play Store or App Store is doubtful. Instead, it opted to integrate the software in some new high-end hardware, and compete in that market. Assistant functions as a differentiating factor for the Pixel and Home. Google showed off how much more powerful Google Assistant is compared with Alexa or Siri, since it's backed by Google's knowledge graph. The AI is one of the few things that differentiates the Pixel from other Android smartphones. Google Assistant requires a different monetization strategy The bigger problem for Google with Google Assistant is that the nature of the service is very hard to monetize. Unlike Google Search, which produces a list of query results that Google can easily slip some ads into, Google Assistant produces just one result per query -- hopefully the correct result. Ads don't fit into that model. By only including Google Assistant on its own hardware, Google is effectively monetizing its service through hardware sales. That's more akin to Apple's business model, especially since it's started giving away macOS updates. It's a big shift for Google, but one necessitated by the nature of the Google Assistant service and the platform Pichai sees computing moving toward. Why we may still see a wide release of Google Assistant The primary purpose of keeping Google Assistant exclusive to Google's hardware may be to differentiate the Pixel and monetize the software. Still, Google Assistant has the potential to benefit the company's core search product. The more people use the AI-powered assistant, the more data Google receives on its users and how they respond to certain answers. Google can feed that data back into its more easily monetized search engine and improve search results and the user experience. Indeed, continually improving its search engine and giving users more and more reasons to use it will move the needle much more than selling a few devices. Google runs a $67 billion advertising business. For reference, Apple sold nearly 55 million iPads last year and generated just $23 billion in sales from the device. The two factors that will affect Google's decision to extend Google Assistant to other devices are how well the Pixel sells and how much incremental revenue Google thinks it can squeeze out thanks to Assistant.

Google will open a pop-up retail store in Manhattan on Oct. 20, the company has confirmed. The store will be located at 96 Spring Street in Soho and focus on the many products Google talked about at its Oct. 4 event, including Google Pixel, Google Home, and others, The Next Web notes. Google offers few details about the store, but the term "pop up" means it will be temporary, most likely through the holidays. Rivals like Apple and Microsoft have more permanent brick-and-mortar locations in the Manhattan; Apple's Soho location is just two blocks from Google's pop-up shop. //Related Articles VIDEO: Microsoft Opens Huge Flagship NYC Store In 2013, Google also hosted a holiday pop-up shop in Bryant Park intended to show off the Nexus 7, Chromebook, Chromecast, and Google Play store. Google also previously had stores in New York, San Francisco and other cities as part of its Google Glass sales pitch. With that product on the decline in 2014, Google closed its stores. In London, though, there is a Google shop located inside Currys PC World on Tottenham Court Road. This time around, it will focus on more consumer-friendly and affordable gadgets like the $129 Google Home smart speaker. Also look for the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the new name for the Nexus lineup, which will be made entirely by Google. They feature 5- and 5.5-inch screens, respectively, run Android Nougat, and come with what Google says is the world's best smartphone camera.

Here's why. Trust in Google Although this is Google's first leap into smartphone design and engineering, there's little reason to be concerned. The company has long held to high standards of care for hardware engineering, and those who have already held the Pixel say it feels (and performs) the way a smartphone should. Google might be the latest entrant into the smartphone market, but with ample cash in the bank and a strong desire to take on—and eventually beat—Apple, early adopters shouldn't have too much cause for concern. This isn't a startup; it's Google. An Overall Solid Design Google's Pixel comes with an attractive design, featuring a slim profile, rounded edges, and comfortable placement for the fingerprint sensor and mechanical buttons. Its metal finish is a design element that trumps many of the plastic Android-based handsets already on store shelves. In sum, the Google Pixel looks like the high-end smartphone it is. Finding Value in Google Assistant Google Assistant is the search giant's latest attempt at utilizing machine learning to deliver smarter solutions to its users, and the Google Pixel will be the first smartphone to support it. The feature is designed to help users find answers to questions, manage their tasks and even keep track of their travel itinerary. Best of all, Google Assistant will get smarter as time goes on, rewarding users for employing the service early and often. The Best Smartphone Camera, Google Says Google said at its press event that the Pixel will ship with the world's best smartphone camera. It will achieve that by offering a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. In addition, it supports HDR+ for better color representation. Add that to the camera's strong performance and low light, and it might snap pictures that are at least on par with many digital SLR cameras. Unlimited (and Free) Storage Google said that Pixel owners will get unlimited storage for all of their photos and videos free of charge through its cloud-based servers. Better yet, all of that content will be stored in their raw format, so users don't lose quality by transferring videos or photos to and from their devices. It's also a great way to save precious storage space on a smartphone, which already comes with up to 128GB of storage. A Little VR Support From Google Daydream To boost its presence in virtual reality, Google said the Pixel will work with its new virtual reality headset, the Daydream View. At first glance, the Daydream View looks quite similar to Samsung' Gear VR, which also lets users insert a smartphone into the device to watch VR content. Anyone who preorders a Pixel will get a Daydream View headset free of charge. It's Nice to See Two Screen Sizes Choice is everything in the smartphone market, and Google understands that. Customers will be able to choose the Pixel in a 5-inch or a 5.5-inch version. The 5-inch version has full-HD resolution and 441 pixels per inch, while the 5.5-inch option comes in at 534 pixels per inch and boasts a slightly better quad-HD resolution. Let's Talk About Support Google will offer a support service for the Pixel called Care by Google. The service will be available 24/7 through an app bundled with the smartphone. When users open the app, they'll be given the option to chat with a Google expert or talk on the phone. The app also includes a screen-sharing feature so the support person can see what's happening on the device and fix it. A Word About Verizon Verizon will be Google's exclusive carrier partner with the Pixel. However, "exclusive" is a loaded term in this case. In addition to selling a Verizon-locked device at the carrier's stores, Google will sell an unlocked version for customers who don't want to be tied to the cellular provider. The Google Pixel also will be available on the company's Project Fi service. A Price That Delivers Value The Pixel starts at $649, putting it on par with other high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 7. Customers who want the 5.5-inch version, known as the Pixel XL, will pay $769. Boosting the device's storage from 32GB to 128GB adds another $100 to that price. A top-notch Pixel, in other words, could touch $869. Verizon is selling its Pixel at the same price, though customers also can choose a monthly installment plan that starts at $27.08. In either case, the Google Pixel is slated to start shipping Oct. 20. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   In a first for Google, the company announced in San Francisco Oct. 4 it had designed and engineered a smartphone. The device, known as the Pixel, replaces Google's Nexus line, but like its predecessor, is designed to be the benchmark by which all of other Android-based devices are judged. The handset ships with the Android Nougat mobile operating system, comes with two screen sizes—5 inches and 5.5 inches—and offers what Google said is the industry's leading rear-facing smartphone camera. Couple that with an affordable price, a high-end processor and some nice looks, and the Google Pixel seems like a fine alternative to Apple's iPhone 7 this holiday season. In the following slides, eWEEK will detail some of the Pixel's best features and discuss the components that make it a great option for both consumers and enterprise users. Google has taken a mighty first step into the smartphone market, and its Pixel could become a powerful force in the hotly contested space.

Source: AAP 11 Oct 2016 - 7:18 AM  UPDATED 11 Oct 2016 - 7:18 AM Tweet The EU regulator investigating whether Alphabet unit Google is abusing its market power has not extended its scrutiny to the tech giant's tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the bloc's antitrust chief says. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros ($A20 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($A210 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticised as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favouring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH  • Business •  Markets Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Business > Google to respond to EU antitrust charges within weeks as fine looms Google to respond to EU antitrust charges within weeks as fine looms Sunday, 2 October 2016 A long running battle between the EU and Google over anti-competitive behaviour will escalate this month as the search giant is expected to formally respond to the charges in the latest clash between a US tech giant and Brussels. Google is scheduled to make an official response to charges of being anti-competitive, including its dominance on the Android operating system, in the coming weeks. But, Brussels is considering a fine against the company, according to Reuters which has seen documents relating to the charges, and which could potentially run into the billions of euros. *Read more*: Say 'allo to Allo - Google's WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger rival ​"We believe that Android has increased competition, lowered prices, and benefited users, developers and phone manufacturers," Google said in a statement on the matter. "We look forward to showing the European Commission how our approach has made Android a successful and sustainable open-source ecosystem." In the Android case, the EU argues Google favoured its own search engine on the operating system by forcing handset manufacturers to pre-install the app and also offering financial incentives to do so, claims which Google denies. The competition commission also claims Google favours its own comparison of shopping products in search results over rival shopping sites in a case finally brought to the charge stage last year after a five year investigation. After the Android charge in April, the EU brought another case against it in July in relation to search advertising results. The EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has cracked down hard on tech companies, moving forward much more quickly with cases than her predecessor. *Read more*: Media groups could get Google payout from EU copyright rules This has culminated in slapping Apple with a €13bn bll for back taxes after deciding that its so-called sweetheart Irish tax deal broke antitrust laws. Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision. The case has raised tensions between US authorities and Brussels, with officials in the US accusing Europe of unfairly targeting companies across the pond. Google is expected to respond to charges by the end of October unless it's granted another extension by the commission. The EU can fine Alphabet-owned Google up to 10 per cent of annual turnover on each charge. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Other recent news in Business Lego ends DAILY MAIL toy giveaway after protest on migrant coverage Trump pledges restraint with Twitter from WHITE HOUSE SOUTH AFRICA's Seokolo elected chairman of IAEA governors First grid connection for PAKISTAN's Chasnupp-3 Rates on store-brand CREDIT CARDS climb to new heights JEREMY CORBYN: Donald Trump's election is a "global wake-up call" Pipeline protesters blocking NORTH DAKOTA construction yard Fin24.com | Zuckerberg among Facebook USERS MISTAKENLY declared 'dead' POPE FRANCIS Pushes for Inclusion in Race, Class, Religion Delhi pollution: Nearly 2 lakh heavy diesel VEHICLES to go off roads today Twitter Facebook Page People Donald Trump John Kerry Barack Obama Current Topics Refugees Australia Sign Modified UFC 205 Miesha Tate Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories Would Bernie Sanders Have Beaten Trump?

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Cloud Computing, Downtime, Enterprise, Google Here’s Google’s Plan for Calming Enterprise Cloud Anxiety by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 10, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Enterprises that sign up for Google’s cloud services will now have the choice to submit their software development and IT operations teams to the same level of operational rigor Google submits its own engineers to. The company on Monday revealed more details about a new approach to cloud customer support it announced last week, created to help alleviate customers’ anxiety about giving up control of their infrastructure to a cloud provider. It will embed its own experts on cloud customers’ teams to help them deploy and run applications in Google’s cloud data centers in the most reliable way possible. The services will include shared paging (when things go wrong), auto-creation and escalation of priority-one tickets, participation in customer “war rooms,” and Google-reviewed design and production system. The company will not charge a penny for what amounts to extremely hands-on professional services, but it doesn’t expect every customer to opt for them, given the level of commitment required on the customer’s part. Dave Rensin, Google’s director of Customer Reliability of Engineering: “This program won’t be for everyone. In fact, we expect that the overwhelming majority of customers won’t participate because of the effort involved. We think big enterprises betting multi-billion dollars businesses on the cloud, however, would be foolish to pass this up. Think of it as a de-risking exercise with a price tag any CFO will love.” Google has formed a new team to support this capability, called Customer Reliability Engineering. The title is a variation on Site Reliability Engineering, a concept created at Google years ago to describe software engineers responsible for building and operating Google’s global infrastructure. The company doesn’t differentiate between software development and IT and in fact prefers to have developers run infrastructure, assuming it’s a job handled better by people with deep understanding of software. CREs will work with customers’ dev teams the same way SREs work with developers at Google. There is a set of ground rules both sides agree to commit to. SREs accept the responsibility for maintaining uptime and healthy operation of a system if: The system (as developed) can pass a strict inspection process — known as a Production Readiness Review (PRR) The development team who built the system agrees to maintain critical support systems (like monitoring) and be active participants in key events like periodic reviews and postmortems The system does not routinely blow its error budget In a way, “error budget” is a different name for availability requirements, or SLAs, such as 99.9 or 99.999 percent uptime. Making Google developers on the product side of things responsible for reliability, SREs give them an error budget, and once they blow it, they have to spend all of their engineering time writing code that fixes the uptime problem they caused and make the system more stable overall. If the developers don’t hold up their side of the bargain, the SREs are free to “hand back the pagers,” meaning they are no longer committed to, say, coming the rescue when something goes down at 3 a.m. Google cloud customers that opt for working with the CRE team will have to agree to the same “social contract” in exchange for its services. Rensin: “When a customer fails to keep up their end of the work with timely bug fixes, participation in joint postmortems, good operational hygiene etc., we’ll ‘hand back the pagers’ too.” Previous Article NetSuite Shares Fall After Oracle Says Deal Needs More Support Next Article NFL Linemen Show Business How It’s Done Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batteries were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum -- and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 percent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 percent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 percent to leave it with market share of 12 percent.   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 percent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 percent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note.

The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 10 Follow @htsuka Samsung has stopped production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a series of explosions in the original and replacement models surfaced. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) As the world watches Samsung deal with the fallout from what could be the worst smartphone launch in recent memory, there should be a smile on faces at Google headquarters. Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days — something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. [Google moves into hardware production with smartphone and other devices] Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world — Apple — has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that it's brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones — despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 — Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn’t study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack ofuffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an e-mail. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. “We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement.  There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem."

EU reportedly won't investigate Google tax issues 0 Share: Tech Industry by Richard Nieva October 10, 2016 11:25 AM PDT @richardjnieva Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech EU regulators say they won't investigate Google taxes.Photo by Justin Sullivan, Getty Images Looks like Google is getting a pass from the European Commission on possible tax issues -- at least for now. The Commission's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, is currently investigating whether or not Alphabet, Google's parent company, abuses its market dominance in search and mobile software to edge out competitors. But the Commission will not be extending its probe to address questions of back taxes, according to a report Monday by Reuters. In January, the Scottish National Party reportedly sent a sent a letter to the European Commission regarding a Google £130 million -- or $160 million -- back tax deal with British tax authorities. In August, the Commission ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland in unpaid taxes. Vestager on Monday also apologized for the Commission's cases against Google taking so long. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she said, according to Reuters. One case is specifically investigating whether or not Google prioritizes its own properties -- particularly when it comes to shopping results -- unfairly ahead of third-party competitors. The crux of the other case is Google's Android mobile software, and whether or not business deals with manufacturers unfairly force them to use and highlight Google services. Google declined to comment. A European Commission representative did not return a request for comment. Tags Tech Industry Google Alphabet Inc.

Microsoft creates a successful strategy called "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" and then promptly forgets it, resulting in a string of failures. Google, which up to now seemed happy to repeat Microsoft's mistakes, accidentally picks up a successful Microsoft practice and uses it against Apple -- likely taking out a number of its Android partners in the process. I'll share some thoughts on the impact of Google's Pixel phone and related product strategy in the context of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, and why this doesn't bode well for Apple, and then close with my product of the week. The Most Powerful Forgotten Strategy In Tech Back when Microsoft was starting out, its most powerful platform wasn't Windows, which was almost an industry joke at the time -- it was Microsoft Office. The purpose of Microsoft Office was to take out Lotus 1-2-3, which was one of the most successful PC applications of its time. Microsoft brilliantly figured out that to remove Lotus it first had to embrace what made the product unique, which meant it not only had to load Lotus 1-2-3 files, but also to run the complicated macros that came with them. So Microsoft created Excel, and it was as close as you could get to Lotus 1-2-3 without being a copy of the product. That made it easy for people to switch. Then Microsoft extended the offering with word processing, a basic database offering, and eventually a presentation product. It priced the package competitively against Lotus 1-2-3, and that motivated people to switch. You see, it's not enough to make an offering as good and as easy to get to as the competition -- you still have to motivate folks to switch. Finally, Microsoft coupled the competitive edge it had gained with enterprise discounts and incentives, heavy marketing, and heavy advocacy to become the standard in office productivity packages. It extinguished Lotus and Lotus Notes in the segment, and Symphony -- the much-too-late response to Office -- failed in market. Microsoft used a shorter but very similar strategy against OS/2, which helped wipe it out of the market as well. It didn't use the same strategy with Zune (it just didn't execute) or its mobile phones, and those efforts failed. Pixel Phone: Embrace + Extend With Android phones, the embrace phase came early on. Android was about as close to a clone of iOS as an operating system could get. It wouldn't run iOS apps, but Android attacted most of the same developers, who developed on both platforms, which reduced the switching cost substantially. However, Google seemed to stall there for some time. It just kicked off the extend part of the strategy with the new Pixel phone, which not only adds a host of impressive additional capabilities, but also ties into Google's emerging IoT strategy. You can get a phone that's priced less than the new iPhones with a better camera, far faster charging, better performance on paper (waiting on reviews), and a far more useful digital assistant. However, the real extension is the growing host of products Google has integrated, including an Amazon Echo-like offering, a relatively unique smart router, an updated TV offering, a growing list of Nest devices, and a new VR headset. Granted, these products mostly will work with iOS devices as well, but they'll undoubtedly work better with Android phones, and some will work best or only with the Pixel. That makes the Pixel more attractive than the iPhone and motivates people to migrate to it. Extinguishing the iPhone Google already is pricing the Pixel at less than the iPhone, but Apple customers are exceedingly loyal to their company. However, Apple clearly has been cutting the cost of manufacturing its product while holding the price constant, and the user experience has been degrading as a result. All it would take would be a substantial number of Apple users seeing this cost-cutting as taking advantage of them, and if Google could give them a voice, then they likely could cause a stampede away from the platform. That is where Google Search likely comes in. Donald Trump recently accused Google of altering its search technology to favor Hillary Clinton (echoing a claim that surfaced this summer). You'd likely be able to toss this out, except the EU has accused Google of manipulating its search tech to favor its own offerings over those of competitors, and it is considering the imposition of historic fines against the company as a result. That's enough smoke to suggest there really is a fire, given the level of EU interest. In the end, the combination of a very strong product that more than matched the iPhone 7 (which is being pounded for its lack of headphone jack rather than praised for its solid advances), a massively growing ecosystem of products, unique technical enhancements (even I'm interested in a phone that will charge to 7 hours in 15 minutes), and the most powerful manipulation tool on the planet (Google Search) adds up to the potential to eliminate the iPhone. Granted, Google still would need to execute, and it has the attention span of a 4-year-old on sugar, but all of the ingredients to take out the iPhone are there. Wrapping Up: Embrace, Extend, Goodbye iPhone This is the first time that a firm has put together all of the elements of an Embrace, Extend, Extinguish strategy since Microsoft introduced in the 1990s. As always, the success of this strategy hinges on the firm's willingness to execute, but it does represent the most powerful threat to Apple's iPhone yet. That said, the part not yet addressed is what happens to the other Android phones. The low-end phones likely are safe, as this is clearly a high-end offering, and most can't afford it. However, given its massive phone problems at the high end, Samsung in particular should be concerned. Long before Google's Pixel takes  take an even bigger chunk out of the other high-end Android phones. To them, this is Microsoft Surface on steroids, and Microsoft pretty much cornered the market on Windows tablets with that offering. Yes, Google definitely will hurt Apple, but it may wipe out a few of its Android phone partners long before Apple feels a pinch. There could really be no other choice this week. I just saw 15-minute charge for 7 hours of battery life (total battery life around 13 hours), and I instantly fell in love. Granted, given Samsung's battery problems, I wouldn't want to be the first one with this phone -- it would be kind of embarrassing to have an airline tell you that you couldn't use it anywhere near an airplane -- but once vetted, this appears to be an impressive bit of kit. Google Pixel It has arguably the best camera in market, and it actually has a headphone jack -- who knew that would be so important? It has Qualcomm's very impressive quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor, a gorgeous FHD or QHD AMOLED screen wrapped with Gorilla Glass 4, a glass aluminum case, and MIMO support for stunning, cutting-edge WiFi performance (though it will require a MIMO router). Among the phone's downsides are that it isn't highly water resistant (it will stand up to sprays of water), and presently it runs only on the Verizon network in the U.S. Given the carrier issue and the fact that it is a brand new and as-yet-untested phone, I will wait to buy it -- but for that 15 minutes to 7 hours charge time, the Google Pixel Phone -- and particularly the XL version -- is my product of the week.

Many have certain features that draw consumers to use them over others and most are a far cry from the old days of Microsoft IM (Instant Messenger). Google has released the preview edition of Allo on Google play  which comes preloaded with Google Assistant. We downloaded it onto a Oneplus 3 and tried it out. First impressions were quite good to be honest. IT is easy to use, straightforward and seems to work without fault. That being said it does have a few creepy undertones, for example: So, what can Assistant do for you? Well, quite a lot actually.: Show me photos of… What is the weather doing in… Set reminders. Search through Gmail for reservations etc. Do Math if you are lacking on that front. Be your personal DJ. Bring up the current, most recent news . Tell you directions, distance to location etc. Play a number of different games within the app. Search out poems when prompted for a welcome break from the grind. Need a pub or restaurant close to where you are staying? Assistant can look for you. Find out whats showing at the local cinema Can tell you info from your emails and calendar. The app does all these tasks for you at a price though, it intelligently works out what you need to know from your previous chat. This means it reads and stores all of your chats, all of them! Google CEO Sundar Pichai was quoted as saying: “We think of this assistant as an ambient experience that extends across devices; It’ll be on their phones, the devices they wear, in their cars, and in their homes.” Google Assistant is also available with Google Home Bear in mind this is probably not the polished article as it is the preview edition, it will probably change a little for final release. Things are about to change, AI is coming and it is not going to go away anytime soon, welcome to your future!

During the event, Apple VP of product marketing Susan Prescott announced a major update to iWork — a significant foray into the enterprise.  Apple’s iWork applications (including Pages, Numbers and Keynote) now enable real-time collaboration, a game-changing move that makes Apple products far more relevant for the digital workforce and pits it squarely against Google G Suite.  But will Apple’s bid to become an enterprise collaboration provider prove successful? What It Will Take for Apple to Compete in Collaboration Enterprise collaboration doesn't just mean sharing documents.  The projects and files that professionals collaborate on is the digital core of their business, and services like Google Drive become the foundation for all of a company’s daily activities.  From that perspective, choosing a collaboration solution is a major business decision. If Apple wants to become a platform of choice for enterprise audiences, it will need to prove its ability to support corporate needs. Enterprises run on ecosystems, which means integrations are key to the success of any company making business software. For a networked enterprise, collaboration means being able to work with customers, partners and other external organizations, as well as internal systems.  A large part of Google’s success thus far is because of its universal accessibility. If Apple wants to truly compete, it will need to support the software that business people already rely on and give them the flexibility to interact with other solutions and aspects of the collaboration ecosystem. In Enterprise Collaboration, Value Comes From Accessibility One of the most important assets of any collaborative platform is its universal accessibility: its ability to facilitate work between co-workers, customers and partners. This is especially important for businesses that regularly interact with their customers.  When collaborating externally, enterprises need to make the customer experience as seamless as possible, which often means working with customers on their terms. Forrester predicts that within the next few years customer-activated communication and collaboration (CACC) (paywall) will replace traditional unified communications and traditional internal collaboration strategies as the “glue” for customer experience.  Allowing customers to dictate their technology of choice helps companies address their needs as painlessly as possible. If iWork fails to integrate with other solutions, companies who rely on it will risk alienating their customer base — a risk not many will be willing to take. Other collaboration platforms have already grasped this. Integrations make shifting between Google G Suite, Box, Dropbox and Huddle frictionless for customers.  These ostensibly competitive solutions support one another because doing so enables users to interact with their customers more easily — which drives success of the entire ecosystem. Apple hasn’t always played nicely with its competitors.  Its products’ incompatibility with various popular software and services (such as Adobe Flash) have been notoriously frustrating for consumers, though never particularly devastating for the brand.  Enterprise audiences, however, won’t afford the company the same flexibility. Big businesses aren’t willing to ostracize customers or partners — nor will they be willing to abandon their existing IT solutions, which many companies have invested in heavily and rely on for business processes. The Evolving Function of Collaboration Technology IDC anticipates that the enterprise collaboration market will grow to $6.2 billion by 2019. The reason for the uptick is largely due to the shifting role of collaboration software, which has evolved to become a foundation for business operations.  Companies have started building processes around their collaboration solution, and many have invested significant resources into building these programs.  A recent Accenture study found that companies that build digital collaboration into their business processes save millions of dollars a year. A subsequent McKinsey survey found that companies using this networked approach improve customer and partner benefits by 600 percent. The number of enterprises taking this approach is climbing steadily every year.  Given the amount of dependency companies have on their existing collaboration platforms, iWork will find the most success by supplementing these platforms, becoming a welcome addition to the enterprise ecosystem. The Collaboration Industry Must ... Collaborate Faced with the challenge of maintaining its staggering growth, Apple has already made the enterprise a key area for market expansion.  In recent years, Apple has announced new partnerships with Cisco and IBM to make the proliferation of its devices grow among enterprise customers. These partnerships appear to lay the foundation for an Apple strategy that embraces the open ecosystem of enterprise collaboration. The company has also demonstrated its willingness to support outside services by increasing compatibility with other business software. In an interview last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “We've turned up the volume on collaboration ... because it's so clear that in order for us to be incredibly successful we have to be the best collaborators in the world. The magic of Apple, from a product point of view, happens at this intersection of hardware, software and services. “  If Apple advances that drive to collaborate externally as well as internally, there might just be a place for the consumer giant in the enterprise after all.

Amy Gesenhues on October 10, 2016 at 2:15 pm More Google Analytics desktop UI is getting a refresh, according to today’s post on the Google Analytics Solutions blog. The new updates, which will be rolling out over the coming weeks, include simplified navigation with customization tools now consolidated in one tab at the top of the new navigation menu (Previously, customization options had been spread across the “Dashboards & Shortcuts” menu, Customization tab and Intelligence Events). Here’s a look at the new navigation updates, which Google says it based on its Material Design standards. (Note: The “Home Customization Admin” option previously in the subheader bar has been removed and is now pinned to the bottom of navigation.) Within the updated navigation menu is the new Customization tab, where all the Google Analytics customization features are now located. In addition to the new navigation and customization tab, the Google Analytics UI now has a new drop-down menu that makes it easy to switch views from any GA page. Other updates include a new “login flow” so that users are taken to the last Google Analytics page they reviewed when they log in, an adjustable default date range and the removal of two pages: Intelligence Events and In-Page Analytics.

(Ravi Kaiknaware via AP) Previous Next PORTLAND, Ore. –  An Oregon teenager has invented a bandage that can tell doctors when it needs to be changed, impressing Google judges and securing a $15,000 scholarship. Anushka Naiknaware, 13, placed in the top eight in an international science contest run by Google. She won the Lego Education Builder Award, which included the scholarship, a free trip to Lego world headquarters in Denmark and a year of entrepreneurship mentoring from a Lego executive, reported the Oregonian/OregonLive. Large wounds must be kept moist to promote healing, but changing bandages too often to check moisture levels can make things worse. To solve that problem, Naiknaware, a seventh-grader at Stoller Middle School in Portland, designed and tested a bandage that is embedded with tiny monitors. They can sense moisture levels and allow medical workers to determine whether the dressing has dried out enough that the bandage needs to be changed. Naiknaware created the sensors by printing a fractal pattern using ink containing graphene nanoparticles. The particles can accurately detect when moisture levels have dropped. More on this...

Naiknaware was the youngest person to win one of the global prizes. She told the Oregonian that being able to interact, debate and play with 19 other curious teen scientists from across the world was one of her favorite life experiences. Another, she said, was the moment she saw her bandage prototype work. "My idea became a physical, tangible reality," said Naiknaware. She said she hopes to use her Lego mentor's advice to figure out how to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for her bandages so a company can produce them at scale. ___ Information from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Advertisement Trending in Health 1 How to get rid of canker sores and prevent them from coming back 2 13 cases of mumps now confirmed at SUNY New Paltz 3 Man gets chopstick lodged in penis 4 Vitamin D levels tied to breast cancer survival 5 Constipation linked to risk of kidney disease, new study finds See all Trends Top Health Centers View All Back Pain Cancer Depression Heart Disease Pain Management Sexual Health Beauty & Skin Cold and Flu Digestive Health Nutrition Pregnancy Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Trending Newsletters Alerts Blogs Mobile Podcasts Radio Fox News Store Apps & Downloads About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Contact Us Email Newsroom FAQ Media Relations Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2016 FOX News Network, LLC.

SUBSCRIBE Does finding that micro-moment feel like chasing fireflies? Here are 9 data points that will help you catch them. Consumers are searching, doing and buying on their mobile devices, yet the challenge to reach them seems greater than ever. Columnist Wesley Young of the Local Search Association takes a look at 9 stats that suggest ways to improve your capture rate. Wesley Young on October 10, 2016 at 11:35 am More Getting the attention of today’s consumer is harder than ever before. They are on multiple devices, accessing numerous forms of media. Their paths to purchase are as varied as flavors of ice cream. And many use ad-blocking technology to run from attempts to reach them. It’s like chasing fireflies that light up and disappear in the dark just as you swing your net. This is a reality that won’t be changing anytime soon. As consumers’ digital experiences are increasingly interrupted by pop-up ads, pre-roll videos and banners that obscure their view, ads and unsolicited content seem to generate more irritation than interest. While more are trying to improve marketing and ROI through targeting, that still doesn’t always solve the problem of timing (i.e., serving up the content at the right moment). The ultimate goal is not just to serve up an ad or coupon to the right person, but also to time it to the moment when that information is needed or desired. Google coined the term “micro-moment” to capture that instant when a person is open to discovery — looking for information or searching for products or services. Micro-moments, according to Google Google VP of Marketing Lisa Gevelber, who conceived the micro-moments concept, explained that in today’s mobile climate, “intent is more important than identity and demographics, and immediacy is more important than brand loyalty.” Google has identified four distinct moments every marketer should know: I-want-to-know moments I-want-to-go moments I-want-to-do moments I-want-to-buy moments Each represents a distinct consumer action, and together they cover the full range of user needs across all stages of the consumer journey. Graphic from Google’s “Micro-Moments: Your Guide to Winning the Shift to Mobile“ The challenge and potential return of micro-moments With micro-moments by definition being short, and the amount of data required to predict when they might occur seemingly voluminous, it’s clear that companies struggle with trying to manage the concept. Forrester reports that only 26 percent of marketers have the data and analytics necessary to identify customers’ moments of need. Only 27 percent have a system in place that can effectively deliver ads or marketing when the moment is identified, and just nine percent can measure them.  Combined, that means only two percent of marketers have all the necessary pieces in place to fully take advantage of the micro-moment. Yet having even some pieces in place can be very profitable. That same Forrester report states that just being able to identify micro-moments makes it 65 percent more likely a marketer will report very profitable mobile ROI. Having an infrastructure to deliver on moments of intent makes it 33 percent more likely, and measuring moments with analytics tools makes it 43 percent more likely. These micro-moments are also great equalizers for local businesses. According to Google, 65 percent of smartphone users look for the most relevant information, regardless of company or provider, which levels the playing field for local businesses that compete with more recognizable brands. Capturing those micro-moments may seem to local businesses like trying to create the perfect storm. But being aware of some consumer behavior and utilizing new technologies can help you get there. Following are nine data points and corresponding tips that may help you adjust your local search and marketing strategy to take advantage of the consumer shift to micro-moments and boost your ROI. 1. 33% of mobile users switch to a competitor who provides helpful information Draft content that helps consumers make decisions. The internet has changed the way we think. As the volume of information increases exponentially, and access becomes easier, we no longer retain information in our memory as before. According to research covered by Harvard Magazine, instead of remembering the content itself, we’ve adjusted to remembering where to find it. In other words, we search for it online, using search terms and platforms where we believe the answer lies. But those who have trouble remembering distinct facts may struggle to use those facts in critical thinking (like decision-making). Today, consumers rely more on content found to provide relevant information that will help them make decisions, which means they go into the process with less bias. That is reflected in statistics from Google that 51 percent of smartphone users have discovered a new company or product when conducting a search on their smartphone — and that one in three users purchased from a company or brand other than the one they intended to after discovering information in the moment they needed it. Further, 69 percent of users are more likely to buy from companies that help them easily find answers to their questions. So, create content that is helpful or educational and that answers questions consumers may have about your product or service. Address attributes that consumers shop for — such as functionality, durability and expertise — and use anecdotes and images to illustrate the quality of your product or service.  Reference or incorporate reviews into your content that others have voted as being helpful to their decision-making process. For example, in response to a search for “best sounding acoustic guitar strings,” an article that compares the various types of strings, the materials they are made of and the pros and cons of each will both attract an interested buyer and help him or her make a decision. Having a link to your related product page or prices and an add-to-cart button will assist with converting that lead into a sale. And use different forms of media designed to be informative. Videos, blogs or articles all are ways to serve informative content, and they can include a call to action to contact, visit or buy from you. 2. 43% of consumers ignore companies that serve irrelevant content Customize relevant search results with local inventory ads. The opposite is also true — unhelpful content is bypassed or can even have negative returns. Consumers just don’t like content that isn’t relevant to what they are looking for. In a survey by Gigya, 67 percent of consumers unsubscribed from email lists when targeted with irrelevant emails, and 43 percent ignored future communications from the company. Thirty-two percent went further and boycotted the company’s sites or apps, and 20 percent stopped buying from the company. Graphic — LSA Insights Paid search, with its ability to respond to high-intent keywords, is great for identifying micro-moments and consumer needs. But the opportunity is wasted if intent-responsive content isn’t served in return. There are some services that can tolerate a single ad that is responsive to most or all searches. For example, a plumber might be able to have a single landing page that touts his or her excellent plumbing experience with reasonable prices, no matter whether the search is for water heater repair, leak detection, fixture installation or other plumbing services. However, if I search for “chew-proof dog beds,” I shouldn’t get the same landing page as when I search for “orthopedic dog bed for older dogs.” I also don’t want to see listings for or pictures of delicate, lacy, pillow-top dog beds. Google recognizes the explosion of such micro-moments happening on its search platforms, especially on mobile devices. Mobile shopping on Google increased by 30 percent in the last year; and in 2016, 34 percent of online retail purchases are made on mobile devices. Google’s response to requests from retailers for help with micro-moments? Local inventory ads. While it’s not a new service, Google has been working on improving local inventory ads. The ads allow brick-and-mortar stores that sell tangible goods to customize results by labeling each product with descriptive attributes. Those might include brand, size, color, material, pattern, pricing and a description of any other relevant attributes or special features. Google also recently added the ability for users to search an advertiser’s inventory in the local Knowledge Panel and include a store pick-up link. It has also expanded shopping ads to image search. The level of detail that may be added to the “product feed specification” provides rich information that will make results relevant and satisfy in-the-moment consumers. Facebook has launched its own version of local inventory ads, Dynamic Ads for Retail. With consumers spending more time on apps (such as Facebook’s) than ever before, this is a serious challenge to Google and an opportunity for local businesses. 3. Companies report over 2X CTR using custom audiences on Facebook Utilize the rich data of social media networks. Another way to meet consumers in the moment is to push unrequested marketing to them that is customized to their needs in the moment. The problem has always been having sufficient data to adequately identify the when and what of that push. But today, social media use captures rich data at an unprecedented depth that can help determine intent and vastly improve the relevance and timing of the push. Even smaller advertisers can leverage the immense resources and computing power of powerhouses like Facebook to identify and target those micro-moments. Not only does Facebook know its users’ demographics, it knows their interests, their behavior, what they like, what they don’t like, what affiliations they have, where they’ve been, what they’ve bought, what they do, what their tastes are, what’s important to them, life events that are happening, their stance on political issues, their income level and many other factors that can be profiled. Facebook also is expanding their Custom Audiences tool to use non-Facebook information to target consumers, as if it didn’t have enough on its own.  New targeting options include frequency of a particular behavior, time spent on content, date ranges of engagement, money spent and devices used. Reports regarding the success of customized targeting with Facebook data seem highly positive. Constant Contact reported a click-through-rate (CTR) of 2.5 percent for the targeted ads compared to 1.12 percent for all Facebook ads. And Kenshoo reported a CTR of 1.7 percent for dynamic ads on Facebook compared to 1.0 percent across all of its clients’ social network ads. 4. 18% decline in time spent per website visit in the past year Keep your content snackable. The internet affects another way we think. Our attention spans are shorter, and we ingest content in less depth. The Atlantic cites Maryanne Wolf, a developmental psychologist at Tufts University, explaining, “We are not only what we read, we are how we read.” And she recognizes that the style of reading of online content puts “efficiency” and “immediacy” above all else. The way we access online content on mobile devices is also affecting reading style. Google reports that 91 percent look up info while in the middle of a task, and 82 percent consult phones while standing in a store deciding what product to buy. Mobile phones allow us to look up anything at any time, and we’re squeezing more into shorter times and spare moments. For example, 69 percent of leisure travelers who are smartphone users search for travel ideas during spare moments. These shorter moments translate into the 18-percent decline Google reports on time spent per website visit this past year. It’s important that you keep information concise and highlight the most important information first. Use headings, lists and bullet points to break up lengthier content, and incorporate graphics when you can to convey information visually and quickly. Also, segregate or categorize content that can be accessed more directly, and label sitemap sidebars and navigational links clearly so that users can easily find information they need. 5. 70% of consumers who abandon websites do so because it takes too long to load Make sure your content is served quickly. Those micro-moments are short, and they need to be sweet. That snackable content needs to be served quickly. Consumers today are in a rush, with 40 percent saying they are always or usually in a hurry when looking for instructions on mobile and over 33 percent saying they are in a rush when searching for a local business. As a result, most of those who abandon websites (70 percent) do so because it takes too long to load, according to Google. Thirty-three percent of all mobile shoppers head to a competitor if they have a negative mobile shopping experience, which might be page speed or poor mobile design. Thus, it’s critical to make sure your mobile site is fast and provides a seamless experience. How long is too long for a mobile website to load? Several years ago, it was reported that 40 percent abandon a mobile site if it takes more than three seconds to load. I’d expect that consumer patience is even shorter today. Yet in 2013, the top 100 retail mobile site load time was 4.33 seconds, and it’s actually getting slower. The number increased to 5.5 seconds in 2015 due to heavier content such as video, heavy fonts and other weighty formats. Check out those numbers and some tips to improve performance using new formats and by removing speed-killing weight here. 6. Offline conversions get up to a 79% lift by using programmatic advertising Categorize your data so you can use programmatic ads to capture micro-moments and focus on end of funnel strategies. I reported on a study by Accordant Media on LSA’s (Local Search Association) blog that showed programmatic advertising overall provided a boost to offline sales. Overall, the campaign resulted in an incremental increase of 35 percent more offline sales, representing a 55-percent lift in conversion rate. In the transaction phase, however, those numbers were 44-percent incremental increase and 79-percent lift. Programmatic advertising seems built for our micro-moments society in which ads can be served instantaneously in response to specific conditions or user activity. This is reflected by the increase in volume of “trading” in the programmatic marketplace by over 150 percent in just the last year. In order to take advantage of programmatic advertising (and many other targeting strategies that help find consumers in those micro-moments), local businesses need to analyze and categorize their customers by those filters used in these platforms. Some broad targeting categories within which there will be a number of specific data filters include site visitation data such as keywords, interest or lifestyle data, behavior, geography and demographics. When properly targeted, the data shows users will visit offline stores and buy at offline locations as a result of these online moments. Red Roof Inn executed this perfectly; it was able to track real-time flight delays that triggered targeted search ads to stranded passengers looking for accommodations. That campaign resulted in a 60-percent increase in bookings across non-branded search campaigns. 7.  58% of mobile users are more likely to buy if they can do so quickly Make sure calls to action are seamless. Amazon recognized early that friction in the checkout and payment process was contributing to the approximately 70-percent cart abandonment rate. It was granted a patent for its 1-Click transaction concept using stored customer credentials to immediately complete a purchase. That concept facilitates an estimated billions of dollars’ worth of annual revenue. Apple felt it was important enough to license and pay for Amazon’s patented idea, allowing its users to instantly download a song on iTunes and make purchases from its App Store. The patent expires in 2017, so that technology will be readily available to local businesses through third-party providers that design their own single-click platforms. Yet it is important even before then for local businesses to find other ways to make the checkout process seamless — Google found that 58 percent of mobile users are more likely to buy if they can do so quickly. Further, the idea can be applied to many other calls to action. Making action easy and instant will boost engagement, traffic and sales. So find ways to reduce friction for actions such as click to call, click to text, directions, bookings, reservations and appointments and other actions that a consumer might take. 8. 35% of Amazon’s revenue comes from product recommendations Invest in high-ROI retargeting. Another Amazon boon is product recommendations. McKinsey reports that Amazon attributes 35 percent of its revenue to recommendations, while Netflix reports that 75 percent of what subscribers watch comes from product recommendations. Other retargeting or predictive marketing includes follow-up from the aforementioned abandoned carts and dynamic ads that retarget users triggered by expressed interest from search, clicks and other intent-based action. ROI numbers like those of Amazon and Netflix have some analysts forecasting widespread adoption of predictive marketing — and technology is making such predictive marketing more accessible to small businesses. Google’s local inventory ads and Facebook’s newly launched competing product, dynamic ads for retail, both accommodate predictive marketing. 9.  50% of local visits are made within 24 hours after local search Keep your retargeting timeline short. While retargeting is effective, I’m sure we’ve all experienced being retargeted long after we’ve already made a decision or a purchase. Micro-moments compress the times between exploration, search, discovery and conversion. Today, Google reports 60 percent of users make purchase decisions more quickly now than they did a few years ago, and 50 percent of local visits are made within 24 hours of a local search. Don’t waste your precious marketing dollars. Keep your retargeting efficient and your ROI positive by limiting the lifespan of a retargeted ad. Of course, the time will vary depending on the product or service. A search for “coffee shop near me” may have a window of 10 minutes; research for a big-ticket item like a car may have a window of several weeks. Final thoughts Micro-moments are here to stay. Those who figure out how to reach consumers at the moment in time when they are looking or doing, or going or buying and can provide helpful, relevant information within a fluid user experience will no doubt be successful.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 AM, October 11, 2016 BRUSSELS - EU regulators who are investigating whether Alphabet unit <GOOGL.O> Google is abusing its market power have has not extended their scrutiny to its tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the EU's antitrust chief said on Monday. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple <AAPL.O> to pay up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks <SBUX.O> up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($160 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticized as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favoring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

SUBSCRIBE Google puts RGB-Hex color converter in search results for “RGB to Hex” queries Often used for web design and graphic design work, an RGB color conversion tool determines exact color values. Amy Gesenhues on October 10, 2016 at 11:25 am More In a continued effort to keep more eyes on itself, Google is pointing their efforts toward web designers by placing an RGB-Hex color converter at the top of search results for “RGB to Hex” queries. An RGB-Hex color converter is often used for web design and other graphic design work to determine exact color values. Spotted this weekend by the Android Police site, Google’s RGB-Hex conversion tool shows up for both desktop and mobile searches. It appears the tool only shows up for the exact “RGB to Hex” query. Searches for “RGB-Hex color conversion” and other variations like “convert RGB to Hex” — or even “Hex to RGB” — did not return the same result.

In a new paper, three Google researchers note that there is no existing way to ensure—as the White House calls it—“equal opportunity by design,” but they have an idea. “Despite the need, a vetted methodology in machine learning for preventing this kind of discrimination based on sensitive attributes has been lacking,” wrote Moritz Hardt, a research scientist with the Google Brain Team and co-author of the paper, in a blog post. Hardt throws out two seemingly intuitive approaches, “fairness through unawareness” and “demographic parity,” but dismisses them for their respective loopholes. By learning from the shortcomings of the aforementioned methods, the team came up with a new approach. The core concept is to not use “sensitive attributes”—race, gender, disability, or religion—so that “individuals who qualify for a desirable outcome should have an equal chance of being correctly classified for this outcome.” “We’ve proposed a methodology for measuring and preventing discrimination based on a set of sensitive attributes,” wrote Hardt, whose co-authors are his colleagues Eric Price and Nathan Srebro. “Our framework not only helps to scrutinize predictors to discover possible concerns. We also show how to adjust a given predictor so as to strike a better tradeoff between classification accuracy and non-discrimination if need be.” In the diagram above, dark dots represent people who would pay off a loan, and the light dots those who wouldn't. In an ideal world, we would work with statistics that cleanly separate categories as in the left example. Unfortunately, it is far more common to see the situation at the right, where the groups overlap. Photo: Google The researchers call this method of not including sensitive attributes equality of opportunity. “When implemented, our framework also improves incentives by shifting the cost of poor predictions from the individual to the decision maker, who can respond by investing in improved prediction accuracy,” wrote Hardt. “Perfect predictors always satisfy our notion, showing that the central goal of building more accurate predictors is well aligned with the goal of avoiding discrimination.” The equality of opportunity principle alone cannot solve discrimination in machine learning, as Google calls for a multidisciplinary approach. “This work is just one step in a long chain of research,” says Google. “Optimizing for equal opportunity is just one of many tools that can be used to improve machine learning systems—and mathematics alone is unlikely to lead to the best solutions. Attacking discrimination in machine learning will ultimately require a careful, multidisciplinary approach.” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

 A former Facebook exec is now running the company taking on Google’s Android Matt Weinberger Oct. 10, 2016, 1:34 PM 4,795 facebook linkedin twitter email print Cyanogen CEO Lior Tal LinkedIn Cyanogen, a well-funded startup creating an alternative version of Google's Android, has shaken up its executive team just a few months after laying off 20% of its workforce amid a strategy refocusing. Lior Tal, a former Facebook executive who joined Cyanogen as its Chief Operating Officer since June 2016, has been promoted to CEO. Former Cyanogen CEO and cofounder Kirt McMaster will be staying on as Executive Chairman of the Board.  Under Tal, Cyanogen will shift its attention away from what had been its core business and towards the company's ambitious longer-term vision. Where before the company had built its business on CyanogenMod, a customized version of Android that doesn't rely on Google's services, the company will now focus in the "short term" on a new "Modular OS" strategy that will let phone manufacturers build pieces of Cyanogen technologies into Android itself, Tal tells Business Insider. It's a stark contrast to Cyanogen's roots as a company that saw its mission as "[taking] Android away from Google." But from Tal's perspective, it would be folly to ignore the fact that Android is the most popular operating system in the world, no matter how much competitors may wish it weren't so. "Android is this huge continent that everyone lives on," Tal says. "That's just how it is." Cyanogen has raised $185 million in funding from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Rupert Murdoch. And while it's had some limited success partnering with companies like OnePlus to preinstall its operating system on new phones, and a close relationship with Microsoft, manufacturers were hesitant to ditch Android entirely for fear of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Modular From Tal's perspective, the "Modular OS" play is a necessary step to achieve the proper scale for the business, without sacrificing the goal of improving Android — even if it means that it won't focus as heavily on building a "full-stack" operating system for a while. Indeed, it's a reconciliation of Cyanogen's "rebellious child" hacker spirit with its need to grow as a business, Tal says. They can keep working on improving Android, without having to worry so much about chipping away at its titanic market share. Cyanogen Executive Chairman and Founder Kirt McMaster Flickr / Web Summit "I think we can achieve the same mission within Android today," Tal says. All or nothing By providing its tech as a series of modular pieces, it means phone manufacturers can combine the bits of Cyanogen they like with the bits of Android they like. That potentially opens the door to new partners who may have been shy about looking at Cyanogen, which in turn could mean more money for the company.  "You don't have to take all or nothing," Tal says. Johan Larson via Flickr McMaster says that it's a new challenge n 2011, he sold his startup Snaptu to Facebook for an estimated $60-70 million. Snaptu provided a bundle of customized, low-bandwidth apps to smartphone manufacturers in the developing world. That technology is the cornerstone of Facebook Lite, one of the social network's main efforts to connect emerging markets to the web. Plus, McMaster says, by putting Cyanogen's technology into more phones and tablets everywhere, it builds out the company's master plan of building out its artificial intelligence capabilities, meaning any phone manufacturer would ba able to take advantage of Google-like AI without needing to incorporate Google tech. "He's the guy to take this to the next level now," McMaster says.   SEE ALSO: Cyanogen CEO on layoffs: We're not pivoting and we're stronger than ever NOW WATCH: 5 wild uses for your old Android smartphone Loading video...

FCA Google is adding some Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its test fleet of autonomous vehicles. Wheego A Wheego EV, based on a Smart Car. As long as it ditches that terrible semiautomatic gearbox it's bound to be an improvement on the original! Baidu Baidu was granted a self-driving test permit at the end of August. It appears the roads of California are about to get even more crowded with self-driving cars. The Wall Street Journal reports that Valeo (a tier-one supplier to the auto industry) and Wheego (an electric vehicle powertrain engineering company) have each been granted permits by the state's DMV to begin testing a single autonomous vehicle on public roads. And over at electrek, there are some grainy spy shots of Google's new fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans, the first fruits of Google's partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. By being one of the first states in the nation to allow for the testing of autonomous vehicles on its roads, California has become quite the hotbed for self-driving car research. The addition of Wheego and Valeo now brings the total number of testing permits issued up to 17. At the end of the summer, Chinese tech firm Baidu gained permission to begin testing autonomous vehicles in the state as well. Those tests appear to be going quite well as of late. As part of the conditions of being granted an autonomous vehicle testing permit, each company must report any accidents to the DMV along with a report of what happened. In the past two years, only 19 such incidents have occurred, the most recent happening at the beginning of September 2016 when a Google test vehicle was rear-ended by a human driver. California isn't the only state in the country to allow for autonomous vehicle testing, however. Pittsburgh is the home of Uber's Advanced Technology Center, and the ride-sharing company has even begun using self-driving vehicles to ferry customers around. According to Quartz, that process has not been entirely problem-free. The news outlet has reported a few minor accidents and at least one case of an Uber test vehicle driving the wrong way up a one-way street. On Monday, HERE (the mapping company now owned by Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz) and the Iowa Department of Transportation announced their own project to develop an autonomous vehicle and freight movement corridor on I-380 between Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Outside of these areas, the rest of us will probably have to wait another few years before we get to ride in driverless vehicles. 2021 has been set as a target for autonomous ride-sharing cars by a number of companies, including Ford and BMW. Listing image by FCA Expand full story Promoted Comments demonbug Ars Centurion jump to post The direct link to the DMV incident report page doesn't look like it works, you have to go here and then click on the link for Autonomous Vehicle Accident Reports (even though the URL is correct). Interesting that the last two incidents were the same situation at the same intersection. Sounds like maybe even if the Google car is behaving the way it should, it is doing something that drivers don't expect. Maybe being exceptionally conservative in waiting for cross traffic, or fooling people into thinking it is going to make the right turn as it creeps forward and abruptly stops? 203 posts | registered 7/30/2010 Reader comments 17 You must login or create an account to comment.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS BRUSSELS EU regulators who are investigating whether Alphabet unit (GOOGL.O) Google is abusing its market power have has not extended their scrutiny to its tax deals with national authorities across Europe, the EU's antitrust chief said on Monday. Margrethe Vestager, who in recent months ordered Apple (AAPL.O) to pay up to 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes to Ireland and Starbucks (SBUX.O) up to 30 million euros to the Dutch tax office, said Google was not on her radar for now. "So far, no, we have nothing formal on that one," Vestager told reporters. She said she had not received any formal complaint from the Scottish National Party which in January sent a letter to the European Commission concerning Google's 130-million-pound ($160 million) back tax deal with British tax authorities which some British politicians criticized as a derisory amount. Vestager also defended the slow pace of the Commission's antitrust cases against Google, saying she wanted the shopping case to be water-tight. This first case has dragged on since 2010 when her predecessor kicked off the investigation. "I am as sorry as you and everyone else that antitrust work is taking a lot of time," she told European lawmakers earlier on Monday. "But it is also a sign that this is a case that is building in its strength as well as a case which is of course strictly following our procedures to make sure that also here we build up the rule of law." Vestager said she did not know when she would issue a decision but the case was a very high priority for her. In the shopping case, Google has been accused of favoring its shopping service over those of rivals in internet search results. It has also been charged with blocking rivals in online search advertising and doing the same with dominant Android mobile operating system. The Commission has warned the company of hefty fines in both the shopping and Android cases and changes in its business practices if it is eventually found guilty of wrongdoing.

It's not too great a leap: according to a Wall Street Journal report, comedy and joke writers from Pixar movies and the Onion are already working on making Google's upcoming Assistant AI voice service feel more loose and vibrant. The development of compelling voice AI will need to start drawing from deeper, more entertaining wells, especially as these home hubs try to have conversations all day long. Current voice AI like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa on the Echo try to engage with personality, and they even tell jokes (usually, bad ones). But, as these services aim to be entirely voice-based, like the upcoming Google Home hub, they'll need to feel more alive and less canned. Google Home debuts this November, and the upcoming Google Pixel phone, arriving in stores and online on October 20, is the first Google product featuring the new Assistant voice service.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us System images for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL leaked By John Hoff - October 10, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Well that did not take long at all. We’ve just had Google launch their new smartphones in the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL, and just barely a week after, we have a leak of the system images – which of course contains all the working software for both the Pixel and the Pixel XL – in our hands. This was leaked by serial leakster LlabTooFeR, source of many high profile leaks before. He swears that these system images will be the final builds mounted on the Pixel and the Pixel XL when they start shipping. Of course testing these images is another matter altogether, since we don’t even have hardware which these images will run on. LlabTooFeR says that these images are for “developers only, as you cannot install them on any existing devices.” That is one hundred percent true, of course. But that doesn’t mean that this leak is totally useless. Developers will be able to start ripping system apps and trying to port them to other devices. They will also be able to start studying how the new APIs work, and then maybe update their apps so that they will work with the Pixel and Pixel XL when these start shipping. If you are interested in these, check out the source link below. The links for downloading the images should be easy to find.

In some cases, even more significant savings could be observed. The improvements will make Chrome easier to use on low-end PCs. Chrome is known to be fairly resource-intensive, demanding more processor time and memory than rival browsers. Over the past year, Google has embarked on a major clean-up effort, bringing the sprawling browser into check and making it more accessible across the range of devices it's designed for. Last week, it detailed changes coming to Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine in December that will bring some much-needed improvements to the browser's memory management. Google has made a series of optimisations that have enabled it to dramatically cut Chrome's RAM requirements, creating a smoother experience on budget devices that have limited amounts of memory. The most noticeable improvements will be on websites that make heavy use of JavaScript. The usual candidates are modern sites and web-apps that have a lot of interactive elements such as video players, adverts and animated transition effects. The vast majority of websites now use JavaScript in some way. Chrome's sped-up processing reduces the time needed for this code to run, making the site more responsive and giving your computer some extra space to breathe. On its test sites, Google observed the new Chrome release using an average of 50 percent less RAM than the current stable version of the browser. It assessed JavaScript performance on a selection of the most popular websites, including YouTube, The New York Times and Reddit, to determine the scores. Not all sites will benefit from the changes in the same way. Many are unlikely to see tangible improvements but others could experience even greater reductions. When looking at the New York Times' mobile site, a 66 percent decrease in RAM usage was experienced. The improvements will make Chrome easier to use on devices that have limited memory. Tabbed browsing will also be faster while consuming less resources. A browser's memory usage can quickly increase once you've got a few tabs open, leaving your PC without enough RAM to handle other apps and services you might be using as well. Many low-end Windows devices have 1GB or 2GB of RAM. A 50 percent reduction in Chrome's usage will be especially noticeable to users of these tablets and laptops. The improvements will ship with Chrome 54, set to be released to the public on December 6th. If you want to reduce your device's RAM consumption today, you can switch to the Chrome Beta channel which already includes the new memory optimisations. Running pre-release software does come with risks though. You may face unexplainable bugs when using a beta release. Google plans to make further changes to Chrome's RAM management over the coming months, this time focusing on mobile devices. Chrome is used by millions of smartphone users each day on devices that may have as little as 512MB of RAM. Google's next round of improvements will target these devices, making mobile browsing less frustrating by boosting performance on modern sites.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion HTC Smartwatch Rumors, Leaked Photos and Specs: Is the Wearable Device Worthy to Compete with Other Smartwatches? By Neal A. Lasta Oct 10, 2016 | 10:18 AM HTC, the tech company based in Taiwan, will unveil the company's first ever Smartwatch product after releasing their flagship smartphone the HTC 10. The HTC 10 is actually one of the best smartphones this year, but unfortunately, the company isn't doing well in sales; at least relative to Apple, Samsung and other tech giants. Aside from the HTC 10 and the new smartwatch, HTC is also actually in charge of producing the new Google Pixel devices which are generating lots of buzz, with some fans calling it the iPhone killer. The HTC Smartwatch is codenamed Halfbeak, and has been in the rumor mill since two years ago. Back then, HTC was rumored to release a wearable device to match the Apple Watch. The HTC Smartwatch was involved in many rumors that point to delayed releases. It was previously suggested that this smart wearable will be released early in 2015, but that obviously didn't happen. With the released photos, however, the Smartwatch might become a reality sooner than later. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Leaked Photos A couple of photos of the HTC Smartwatch have been leaked through Weibo. The photos show HTC is joining Motorola, Huawei, LG and Samsung in creating devices running on Android Wear. HTC Smartwatch Features and Specs HTC's Smartwatch has long been in the rumors, but it's only been recently that a leak of the actual device in photos has been released. It is a circular watch with a metallic surface and a 360 x 360 resolution. At the back of the Smartwatch, the Under Armour logo could be seen on top, with the HTC logo at the bottom part. Under Armour is an accessories and sports clothing company which has recent ties with HTC. Under Armour also partnered with HTC over its first fitness wearable called Grip. Aside from the circular design, the Smartwatch also has a rubber or silicone band. This gives the watch a sporty look and provides evidence that the device is primarily targeted towards health and fitness enthusiasts. On the right side, two physical buttons can be seen. One of these buttons are probably the switch button to power on or off the HTC Smartwatch. At the back of the watch are pogo pins which may connect to a charging cradle. Some rumors also say that the device will have an AMOLED display, and have Android Wear for its operating system. Despite the leaked photos, nothing is ever certain until we hear from the company itself.

Samsung continues to experience problems with Galaxy Note7 batteries overheating, but Google's grand re-entrance into the smartphone market could be a bigger problem. By Conner Forrest | October 10, 2016, 8:04 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: CNET When it comes to smartphones, Samsung has a very public problem on its hands. Replacement Galaxy Note7 devices, exchanged for original models that overheated, have also begun catching catching fire and creating a plethora of problems for their users. In Kentucky, a man claimed that his replacement Galaxy Note7 caught fire while he was sleeping and caused him to seek medical help for smoke inhalation. Another replacement Note7 caught fire on a Southwest Airlines plane (also in Kentucky), which led to an evacuation of the entire flight. On Monday, Samsung officially confirmed that it would be suspending production of the devices until it could get the battery issue under control. This is after the US government issued its own formal recall of the devices in mid September. While some have called this issue a nightmare, and some carriers have considered ending sales of the device, a bigger threat to Samsung's dominance in the smartphone market is Google's Pixel Phone. SEE: BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy Template (Tech Pro Research) Make no mistake, the exploding battery problem is a serious issue, and Samsung must address it properly. However, if they do so, they should be able to survive what it has brought about. Even in recent history, there are a plethora of examples of major corporations dealing with critical issues brought about by their products. Exxon survived the Valdez oil spill and Ford survived exploding Pintos. Even Apple, one of Samsung's biggest competitors, made it through Antennagate and will likely make it through the controversy caused by its decision to eliminate the traditional headphone jack on the iPhone 7. According to research firm Gartner's latest numbers, Samsung holds 22.3% of the worldwide market share for smartphones. Since that number includes iOS and Windows, it would likely grow in the context of the Android market exclusively. And despite the problems caused by the Galaxy Note7, Samsung's stock recently hit an all-time high. Enter the Pixel A bigger problem in front of Samsung is Google's re-entering the smartphone market with its Google Pixel phone, announced on October 4, 2016. The Pixel phone presents an impressive feature set that could grab the attention of undecided users. The biggest issue, though, isn't about the hardware specs. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be the deciding factor for which company comes out on top, and the Pixel is predicated on that premise. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, went as far as to say that the next evolution of computing is moving from "mobile-first to AI-first," with its new Google Assistant.

Here's the catch: Google may not necessarily be providing Google Assistant to all of its Android OEM partners. And even if it does, update complications may delay their ability to bring Google Assistant to market with their phones. Samsung recently acquired Viv Labs in order to build its own AI-powered conversational interfaces, but only time will tell if they stack up to the Google Assistant. Some analysts, like Gartner's Tuong Nguyen, have argued that the Pixel phone isn't a threat to Samsung. Google products aren't about selling massive volumes, and the Pixel phone is currently limited to Verizon, Nguyen said. So it may attract some Verizon Note7 users, but there are many other high-end options available right now from companies like LG and Huawei, and even other options from Samsung. "I don't think threat is the right word for this situation," Nguyen said. "It's one of the many devices that may benefit from Samsung's misfortunes, but it's not the single device/brand that will cause an impact on Samsung's sales/share—the Note 7 did this by itself without 'help' from the competition." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Samsung Galaxy Note7 replacement devices began overheating recently, sending one man to the hospital and causing the evacuation of a Southwest Airlines plane. Despite its problems, Samsung maintains a strong market share and its stock price has risen to new heights even with the Galaxy Note7 debacle. Google's Pixel phone is a greater threat to Samsung's Android dominance because of its integration with Google Assistant and its top-shelf feature set.

Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3: Which is best? by Joe Roberts 10 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3: Can the Chinese firm's top-specced phone hold its own against Google's latest flagship? After months of waiting and leaks (mostly leaks), Google has finally unveiled its new Pixel phone, which comes in the form of both the Pixel and Pixel XL, and it looks to be an impressive device. The big G has crammed a load of top-end hardware into this one, taking on the big boys with a serious handset. But OnePlus has already debuted its flagship with some similarly impressive hardware at a much lower price. So, is it worth spending the extra on Google's own smartphone? Or will you get just as good an experience with OnePlus' alternative? Read on to find out. Related: Pixel vs Pixel XL WATCH: Google Pixel hands-on Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Design Google (with a little help from manufacturer HTC) has gone for metal and glass design this time around, with a two tone finish on the back, no camera bump, chamfered edges, and a generally pretty standard-looking phone. The Pixel comes in two sizes, a 5-inch version and a 5.5-inch version, and features a fingerprint scanner on the back, just above an antenna line which wraps around bottom of the backplate. Overall, it looks a lot like the HTC One A9. Related: Pixel vs iPhone 7 As does the OnePlus, with its dual antenna lines on the top and bottom of the backplate. Around the front, things are a little different, however. The elliptical home button makes for a more conspicuous navigation tool than on the Pixel, which eschews the home button in favour of navigation buttons built into the software. OnePlus' home button does double as a pretty fast fingerprint scanner though. In terms of size, the OnePlus comes in at 5.5 inches, matching the Pixel XL, and weighs 158g – 15g more than the 5-inch Pixel and 10g less than the Pixel XL. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Display Of course, with two different size phones, you're going to get two different size screens. But if your were expecting the same resolution on both Pixels, think again. The smaller version packs a Full HD screen, while the XL comes with a Quad HD offering. And while the difference won't be all that noticeable, when using the phones for VR (these are the first handsets that will work with Google's new Daydream VR platform) the higher resolution will be noticeable. Related: Galaxy S7 vs Pixel So, has OnePlus managed to match the Pixel XL? Put simply, no. The Chinese handset comes with the same 1,080 x 1,920 resolution as the smaller Pixel. It's also not going to work with Daydream VR. It's still a great screen, however, as is the 5-inch Pixel's. Both companies have used AMOLED tech in the displays – meaning you'll get deeper blacks and much better energy efficiency than you would with an LCD panel. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Hardware OnePlus prides itself on providing top-end hardware at a reasonable price, and the third of the company's flagships certainly delivers in that department. Under the hood of the OnePlus 3 lies a Snapdragon 820, the same chip powering the HTC 10 and many Galaxy S7 models, and a whopping 6GB of RAM. It makes for speedy performance, even if the phone does get a tad warm under pressure. Google, for its part, has gone a step further and stuck a new Snapdragon 821 processor in its Pixel phone. The new Qualcomm chip reportedly comes with a 10% boost in performance speed over the 820 – a claim we're yet to test out. When it comes to RAM, however, there's 2GB less than on the OnePlus. Related: Pixel XL vs Galaxy Note 7 Still, we're expecting Google's devices to be some of the best performing phones you're able to buy when they eventually launch. Until we're able to get a full review done, then, we'll have to wait to pass judgement. In terms of storage, OnePlus gives you a decent helping of 64GB while Google offers either 32GB or 128GB on its Pixel phones. Unfortunately, neither handset comes with expanadable storage, so you won't be able to whack a MicroSD card in your phone whether you go with OnePlus or Google. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Software Both these handsets run on Android, but there are some notable differences. The most obvious of these is that the OnePlus 3 is still on Android Marshmallow, while the new Pixels come with the latest Android Nougat already installed. That means Google's handsets can take advantage of new features such as a split-screen mode and better power efficiency. However, it won't be long until OnePlus 3 owners get an upgrade, so the playing field will be somewhat levelled very soon. We say somewhat as the OnePlus still won't be 'Daydream-ready' even after the upgrade, so Google will still have a slight edge. Related: Pixel vs Nexus 6P The good news is OnePlus 3 owners shouldn't have too long to wait for Nougat to land on their handsets. While there's no official date set just yet, the company revealed a launch would be happening soon in a recent Reddit AMA. Other software differences between the OnePlus 3 and Pixel include the skin which sits on top of the Android OS. Google is adding its new Pixel launcher to the stock version of Android, which doesn't change the overall look too much, adding new circular app icons and dispensing with the app drawer. OnePlus, however, uses its own OxygenOS skin, which makes a few more design changes. There's a built-in Dark mode, alongside a load of new customisation options that let you do things such as tweak the software soft keys. But overall the skin is one of the least intrusive available, which means the overall user experience isn't spoiled. It remains to be seen how well OxygenOS works with Nougat, however. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Camera Google made a lot of the camera it's provided with the Pixel phone. Both the 5-inch and 5.5-inch model come with a 12.3-megapixel offering that features a decent f/2.0 aperture with a 1.55µm pixel size. And while we're yet to test out the camera, it sounds like a suitably top-end setup that should ensure good shots. Whether it'll be able to outdo the Galaxy S7's stellar camera remains to be seen, but on paper it certainly doesn't look like it. And it's the same story for the OnePlus 3. Although the 16-megapixel camera sounds better than the 12-megapixels offered on the Pixel and the Galaxy S7, we found in our tests that the shooter, although excellent, wasn't quite up there with Sammy's offering. Still, it's a great camera that produces photos with natural colours and superb contrast. Both the Pixel and OnePlus 3 are also capable of shooting 4K video, and both come with an 8-megapixel front-facing camera – so your perfectly posed selfies should look magnificent. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Battery We found battery life on the OnePlus 3 to be a bit hit and miss. In tests the phone managed to last 17hrs 25mins playing a 720p MP4 movie on loop, which is very impressive. But in our experience some software will accelerate the loss of charge, and we often found the non-removable Li-Ion 3,000 mAhbattery would drain within a day. When it comes to the Pixel phone, we're yet to test the phone out, so don't have any real-world experience to go on. We'd expect the 2,770mAh cell in the Pixel phone, and 3,450 cell in the Pixel XL to do a decent job though, especially considering the energy advantages that come with an AMOLED screen and Android Nougat. We'll have more once we've tested the phones out. Both the OnePlus and Pixel phone use a USB Type-C port to charge, which adds an element of future-proofing to the handsets. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Price and release This is where OnePlus shines. The firm is offering all that high-end tech for just £349.99. While that's more than previous OnePlus flagships, it's still a hell of a lot cheaper than you'd pay for the same hardware in a phone from the big players such as Samsung or Apple. The Pixel phones are available to pre-order now in the US and UK. The Pixel will be £599 (32GB) and £699 (128GB) with the Pixel XL coming in at £719 (32 GB) and £819 (128GB). The phone will actually release on October 20. That makes it much more expensive than the OnePlus, making this section an easy one to call in favour of the Chinese firm. Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 – Summary Want an afforable phone that's as good at the Pixel (at least on paper)? Go with the OnePlus. If you want to get onboard with Google's serious smartphone push, and take advantage of all the Google Assistant stuff – go with the Pixel.

The price of the OnePlus is might tempting, however, and while we're impressed with the Pixel phones, we're not yet sure if they're worth the extra cash.

Wally October 12, 2016, 7:00 am Do you currently own a OnePlus 3? fbruce October 13, 2016, 6:11 pm Part-way into this article, I realized that you have not tested the Pixel phone at all! ("When it comes to the Pixel phone, we're yet to test the phone out, so don't have any real-world experience to go on.") So, at least from the Pixel's perspective, the comparison is very much "on paper". I think you should have stated up front that the following comparison is pure speculation... jebova2301 October 16, 2016, 10:42 pm Really, if you look at it, the pixel phone is actually slower(based on clock speed), even though it has the newer SoC. The Snapdragon 820 model number is the MSM8996, and has a factory clock of 2.2ghz on two cores and 1.6ghz on the other two. The 821 is model number MSM8996 PRO, and is capable of running two cores at 2.4ghz, and the other two at 2.0ghz. They are both the same architecture. The 821 is simply able to be clocked slightly higher. This is where the funny specs come in. The OP3 runs the 820 with two cores running at 2.2ghz, and the other two at 1.6ghz. The Pixel phones have their 821s running at 2.15ghz on two cores, and 1.6ghz on the other two. Based on those numbers alone, the OP3 should be able to outperform the Pixel phone in theory. Now, obviously this all comes down to how well the companies do with optimizing the phone to make the most of its resources. I am looking forward to trying a Pixel and a OP3 side by side and see how they both seem.

The Celebrating Arabic Reading initiative is offering readers up to 90 per cent off online Arabic-language books in the Google Play Books store. The offer is valid in nine countries across the region, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Emirates Group, said the initiative aims to encourage more people to read Arabic content in digital form. "Smartphones and tablets are increasingly a part of our daily lives, so it makes perfect sense to promote reading on these new platforms as well," he said. "People are hungry for content, especially Arabic digital content, and there isn’t a smarter investment for the future of this region than providing access to e-books to broaden the horizons of millions." Ronan Harris, Google’s vice president for large customer sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said he hoped the partnership with Emirates would make reading Arabic literature more accessible and enjoyable. "There is so much opportunity to build the digital ecosystem here and we’re happy to have partners like Emirates make it happen," he said. The initiative, which is supporting the UAE’s Year of Reading campaign, is set to last through the month of October and is available on both iOS and Android platforms. newsdesk@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related 2016 a ‘tough’ year says Emirates’ Tim Clark as Europe and Africa weigh on Dubai carrier Sharjah International Book Fair announces visiting authors for 2016 Parents show children importance of Arabic by taking lessons themselves Hundreds of Fujairah school pupils enter world of learning on book bus More UAE Dubai puts autonomous smart car through its paces on roads UAE Helping Hands: Working man who fell hard needs help to get back on his feet Dubai community farm is for all after apartment residents were initially excluded Emiratis in Abu Dhabi living with MS ‘more than double global average’ MOST VIEWED UAE | All Emiratis in Abu Dhabi living with MS ‘more than double global average’ Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Dubai puts autonomous smart car through its paces on roads Dubai community farm is for all after apartment residents were initially excluded Man arrested with Dh1 million worth of heroin in his stomach Dubai surgeon suspended after patient left brain damaged Two in five are cyber crime victims UAE Helping Hands: Working man who fell hard needs help to get back on his feet MS unpleasant but manageable Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 12 minutes?

Picture: Beck Diefenbach San Francisco - Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available... GOOGLE Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets - aiming to outdo Apple's Siri - enabling users to organise and use information on the devices and in the cloud - to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. SAMSUNG The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort to provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. AMAZON Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its “Alexa” artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called “Dot” and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. MICROSOFT Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name “Cortana” and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana - a name based on a character in its blockbuster game Halo - responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. FACEBOOK Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename “M”. The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of “Jarvis”, the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series Iron Man. For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered “bots” on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. APPLE Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with “Deep Blue” software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with “Watson” artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

The shares, which spiked last month following speculation of a takeover by companies including Google, fell $2.82, or 14%, to $17.03 in early trading after Bloomberg reported that Twitter was unlikely to receive any takeover bids. Google owner Alphabet, Walt Disney and Silicon Valley tech firm Salesforce have all been working with investment banks on a potential acquisition of the 140-character service. But Bloomberg reported over the weekend that all of the firms had decided not to press ahead with a bid. How would Salesforce, Google and Disney benefit from buying Twitter? Read more Twitter’s shares already had fallen heavily at the end of last week after Silicon Valley technology news website Recode reported Google and Apple had decided against buying the company, which has been struggling to attract new users and build revenue. Twitter’s stock market decline brings the company’s share price back below the level it was trading at before the takeover speculation was first reported on 23 September. The social media company, which floated on the stock market in November 2013 at $26 a share and whose shares reached a high of $69 soon after, had hired Goldman Sachs Group and Allen & Co to investigate a sale. Twitter’s chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey was opposed to a sale, but fellow co-founder and board member Ev Williams supported it. The company is reported to have hoped to conclude a sale before it reported its third quarter results on 27 October. Salesforce had been seen as the most likely buyer as its chief executive Mark Benioff had publicly expressed his interest in Twitter. However, he appeared not to have sounded out his investors in advance. Benioff was forced onto the defensive at a shareholder meeting last week after many investors publicly and privately expressed their doubts about the deal. “I read all of your notes; you probably know that,” he said at the meeting in San Francisco. “I also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.” Salesforce’s shares, which had been depressed following the Twitter acquisition speculation, rose by 5.4% to $74.70 on Monday – taking them back to roughly the level they were at before the takeover talk was first reported.

"When it comes to Google trends, we are seeing a great number of individuals heading to the web to become more informed," he said. "The tie-in searches proves that many still want to know why Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton are criticized from comments about women and what happened in Benghazi, respectively."

"Viewers wanted to see and hear his further reaction to those statements and how Secretary Clinton would respond," said Mollica.  "This debate had the makings of one that would see strong reactions. Twitter echoed that sentiment last night." Similar to the first presidential debate, Trump dominated Twitter conversations during Sunday’s face off, accounting for 64 percent of the conversation on the social media site.

Skip to content Double Jump A blog run by two geeky sisters sharing their love for video games. Menu Home About Us Contact Us HomeVR Pitfalls VR Pitfalls October 10, 2016October 10, 2016 Kris P. Home, Kristengames, google, headsets, pitfalls, pixel, video games, virtual reality Happy Monday, folks! Talking again about virtual reality, this post is mainly about my reservations about this section of the video game market. Virtual reality is amazing, but there is definitely room for improvement… Google has joined the smart phone race with their new Pixel phone. I think it looks pretty good, and I’m not ruling it out the next time I need to upgrade my phone, but I also realized that Google has a VR headset — called Daydream — to go with the Pixel. It made me realize that there’s quite a few VR sets out there on the market. The Vive, the Playstation VR, Samsung Gear VR, Google’s Daydream… As a kid, virtual reality was a distant dream. Now, we suddenly have all these options, all these companies vying for a piece of the action. Virtual Reality headsets are, more or less, special goggles that go right in front of your eyes. As a kid, Mom and Dad constantly told me not to sit so close to the television lest my eyes get ruined (and now I wear glasses for distance — coincidence?). The VR headsets just toss that piece of advice out the window. With that said, do these VR headsets have a time limit? Being immersed in a video game such as that for so long isn’t healthy at all. If the headsets have, say, an hour time limit, that may be good. Perhaps that’s why the Batman: Arkham VR is only about an hour long. The wires and set up can be dangerous as well. Virtual Reality games tend not to have the player move much, avoiding the danger of tripping over wires and speakers, but the immersion aspect is ruined. Maybe one day there will be a VR set that has a treadmill-like mat, one that allows the player to walk around in place. Overall, I would still love to try out virtual reality games, but I’m also eager to see how this particular corner of the video game market will improve over time.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Oct 10, 2016, 11:11am EDT share tweet Linkedin Last May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) signed a deal to make a fleet of self-driving Pacifica minivans — the first phase in a broader autonomous car deal between the two companies. On Sunday, the first prototypes were spotted in a San Francisco parking garage by the CEO of Enterprise Garage Consultancy, who sent some spy photos to Electrek. They show over a dozen plug-in hybrid Pacificas with cameras and LIDAR sensors mounted on their roofs. Google won’t say when it plans on deploying the minivans, or in what capacity. But it’s worth noting that the minivans were spotted around the same time that Google made two significant announcements: its self-driving Lexus SUVs have driven a combined 2 million miles on public roads; and the company is launching a new ride-sharing service centered on carpooling. You know what’s a good vehicle for carpooling? Minivans! You know what’s a good vehicle for carpooling? Minivans! (We’ve reached out to the Enterprise consultancy CEO for permission to use his photos, and will update this story when we hear back.) FCA’s chief, Sergio Marchionne, has made it clear he has grand plans for his company’s partnership with Google, but it’s not clear Google feels the same way, considering the deal is non-exclusive and the search giant has been on record about wanting to work with multiple manufacturing partners. It’s also up in the air how Google will make money from its self-driving efforts. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is close to spinning off its self-driving car division as a standalone business. And the project has lost much of its top talent, including chief technology officer Chris Urmson. Meanwhile, other companies have accelerated their self-driving efforts, including Uber, which launched a limited public run in Pittsburgh last month, and General Motors and Lyft, which have been testing driverless Chevy Bolts in San Francisco and Scottsdale, Arizona.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Access .onion Sites (Also Known as Tor Hidden Services) Website addresses that end in “.onion” aren’t like normal domain names, and you can’t access them with a normal web browser. Addresses that end with “.onion” point to Tor hidden services on the “deep web”. Warning: Lots of .onion sites contain very nasty things, and many of them are likely scams. We recommend staying away from “browsing” .onion sites–instead, use this only if you have a specific site you want to access for a good reason. What Is a .onion Site? RELATED ARTICLE How to Browse Anonymously With Tor Tor–short for “the onion router”–is an anonymizing computer network. It’s partially funded by the US government, and is designed to help people in countries where Internet access may be censored or monitored. When you connect to Tor, your internet activity is sent through the Tor network, anonymizing your Internet activity so it can’t be snooped on, and so that you can access websites that may be blocked in your country. So, when you access google.com through Tor, your request bounces from Tor relay to Tor relay before it reaches an “exit node”. That exit node then contacts Google.com for you, and it sends you back the data Google responded with. Google sees this as the exit node’s IP address contacting it instead of your IP address. RELATED ARTICLE Is Tor Really Anonymous and Secure? But that means that “last mile” of traffic can be snooped on by an organization monitoring or even running the exit nodes–especially if your traffic is unencrypted. A “.onion” address points to a Tor hidden service, which is a server you can only access through Tor. This means that your browsing activity can’t be snooped on by someone watching the Tor exit nodes. It also means that someone hosting a website can hide that server using the Tor network, so no one can find it–in theory. For example, Facebook maintains an official Tor hidden services address at “https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/”. This allows you to access Facebook through Tor, and your connection doesn’t ever leave Tor where it can be snooped on. This may be useful in countries that block Facebook, for example. You don’t necessarily want to use Tor all the time, as it’s slower than just browsing normally. But it’s a useful tool for anonymizing your Internet activity and bypassing censorship. How to Access .onion Sites with the Tor Browser To access a .onion address, you’ll need to access it through the Tor Browser. It’s a modified version of Firefox that’s configured to connect to sites through the Tor network. Download the Tor Browser from the Tor project’s website to continue. It’s available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Android phones and tablets, you can download the official Orbot proxy app or Orfox browser from Google Play. The Tor project offers no official Tor apps for iPhone or iPad. After launching the Tor browser, type the .onion address into its address bar. For example, to access Facebook’s hidden service, you’d enter the following address: https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/ Or, to access the DuckDuckGo search engine’s hidden service, you’d enter: http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ While using the Tor browser, you can click links to .onion addresses and they’ll load normally. But they’ll only work in the Tor browser, while connected to Tor. Don’t Access .onion Sites Through Proxies Like Tor2Web You can also access .onion sites without running Tor through proxies that connect to Tor for you. The proxy connects to Tor for you and then forwards you the traffic over the regular Internet. This, however, is a very bad idea! You’re losing the anonymity you normally have when you connect to a .onion site through the Tor browser. That’s the whole point of a .onion address, after all. The website you access maintains its anonymity, but someone monitoring your connection can see which website you’re connecting to. The service provider can also see what you’re connecting to and snoop on any passwords and other private information you provide over the connection. Tor2web functions in this way, but you shouldn’t use it. For example, if you attempt to connect to Facebook’s hidden service using Tor2web, Facebook blocks the connection and tells you it’s a bad idea. Looking for lists of .onion sites? Search the web for lists of .onion sites and you’ll find some places to start. Many of the directories of .onion sites are themselves stored on .onion sites, though, which you can only access through Tor. Again, beware: Lots of .onion sites contain very nasty things, and many of them are likely scams. We recommend staying away from them, if possible. This trick is best used when you want to browse to a specific .onion site.

The company has already spent $3.2 million on TV ads in two days, but ad executives expect Google and partner Verizon to spend hundreds of millions more. Google hasn’t openly discussed how much it will spend on advertising the Pixel, but Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz recently told Reuters that the Pixel would have a very significant marketing campaign and that the tech giant may be buying ads during Thanksgiving football games. Those are some of the priciest ads in the business, going for upwards of $1 million dollars for 30 seconds of air time. Google isn’t the only company going all-in on the Pixel series, though. Carrier partner Verizon is also planning on investing a significant amount into advertising the new phones on TV, digital marketing, and social media. Verizon’s campaign won’t kick off until the phone officially launches on October 20th, but it will last through the holiday season, according to Verizon’s vice president of device marketing. local_offer    Google   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (37) stars Further Reading Verizon launches BOGO deal Google starts selling OtterBox cases Exclusive: Project ARA specifications, design Google lists new live cases Buy the Daydream View today! stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 2 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.
