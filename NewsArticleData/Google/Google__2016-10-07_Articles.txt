The expectation and the hope is that Google probably would let bygones be bygones, but the messaging and texting app may not have a foot in the door in just a couple of months. In fact, on December 1, Google will actually remove Hangouts from the core Google Mobile Services package and replace the app with its new video chatting service, Duo. The “gapps” package is what gets pre-loaded from Google on all Android smartphones. The change was announced in an email obtained by Android Police. “Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products,” Google stated. That means that manufacturers can opt to have the app pre-loaded with the rest of the package, but, as David Ruddock points out: There’s also no guarantee that manufacturers will stop bundling the Hangouts app on their devices, but I would strongly assume that’s likely – OEMs and mobile operators want to push their own messaging solutions, or those of partners paying for placement on their devices, and Hangouts was competition. Interestingly, Allo is not required in the GMS package, though it may be more complicated to sell as a chat app than Google’s own barebones, SMS-based Messenger app — yet, it’s also not in gapps. Google claims that Hangouts for Android will still receive support as the product is right now, though we could see more changes that could suit it for business as opposed to general communications.

On the plus side, Google has made some fantastic (review pending) phones that can easily stand toe to toe with any flagship out there. With a premium look and feel and specs to match, Google has now joined the OEM community with a very strong entry. And with that strong entry comes a strong price tag. The Pixel phones are pricey. A base model costs the same as a base model iPhone, and a base model Galaxy S7. Gone are the days when Google could be counted on to release a good phone with a great price. But looking at the landscape these days, I’m not so sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. Now, it’s true that I wrote a few days ago that Google picked the wrong time to make an expensive phone. But that was based solely on the concept of price. Let’s look at the bigger picture. Stock or die Google has built a bit of a reputation for bringing good phones to the market to serve as a showcase of how Android “should be”. In a world of Android skins ranging from Touchwiz to EMUI, Google needs a showcase of Android as it is intended to be. Developers rely on a stock Android experience with fast updates to make sure their apps continue to function properly with updates as they’re released. There’s a reason Developer Previews are made available early – so when Android O comes out, the fit doesn’t hit the shan. So can developers really be expected to pick up hardware costing over $600 to develop their free face switcher app? That seems a bit much. On iOS, a developer can pick up an iPhone 6 for a couple of Benjamins. They can count on the fact that their app will run pretty much the same on it as it does on an iPhone 7. So what’s an Android Dev to do? Strong competition But more than that, and to be fair I’ve already made this argument in my other article so I’m not going to repeat every point here, but with so many great sub-$400 phones out there, why is Google suddenly upping its price game? The current crop of smartphones out there seems to be right in Google’s wheelhouse, but instead it’s swinging for the fences. That doesn’t make any sense And yet… Until you consider what Google’s ultimate goal might be here. Maybe Google isn’t competing against other midrange phones because it doesn’t want to compete against midrange phones. Maybe Google is focusing on developing a consumer product, rather than a developer product. If that’s the case, suddenly Google’s specs and price points make a heck of a lot more sense. Plus, let’s consider the fact that the Nexus line of phones hasn’t always been so low priced. Starting the with the Nexus 6 and moving forward to the 5X and the 6P, we haven’t really been seeing a lot of super low prices. The Nexus 5 may have been the last of that line. Anecdotally, when I look around, I see a lot more Nexus 5X and 6P phones around than I’ve ever seen previous Nexus phones. The consumer world has taken notice of Google’s offerings and started to buy them. It makes sense that Google would want to up its game in that arena. Going home Plus, the Pixel phone is Google’s first hardware showcase for Google Assistant, which is the direction Google wants to go. Sundar Pichai said he wants to create a personal Google for everyone in the world, and Google Assistant is a means to do so. With devices like the Google Home coming out to complement Google Assistant, Google’s initial offering to consumers has to be a consumer product – not a phone for techies and geeks, lest that the be extent of Google Assistant’s usefulness. Google Assistant is a mostly untested product, but Google seems to have a lot riding on it. To hamstring the service by offering it on a midrange phone when most people are running to Samsung and Apple, would make the service pretty much DOA. At least now with the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google can make a solid case to pick up its phone with Google Assistant, rather than the Note 7 which comes with a built in hand warmer. Oh no he didn’t. Oh yes he did. Sound off So what do you think? Is Google shooting itself in the foot with these lofty prices? Or is Google simply switching its focus from developers to consumers, and adjusting its strategy to match? Now, don’t be salty that the phone costs a lot – it’s easy to do. But focus on the big picture here, let me know what you think in the comments, and let’s see if we can figure this out. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

There’s nothing on the router’s spec sheet that just quite mentions what’s going on with the power adapter, — other than it has a 15W maximum, but the device only consumes 9W — but Leung announced that USB-C connectors are on the adapt. In fact, its configured to the same 5V, 3A spec that Google chose for the Pixel C. “You could just as easily use [the adapter] to charge one of your new Type-C phones,” Leung posted on his Google+ page, “and conversely, use your phone’s 15W power adapter to power Google WiFi.” Source: Google+, Google Via: juggly.cn (Google Translate) Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. I followed him into a spacious venue packed with nearly 400 people painting faces, filling in coloring books, and wrapping yarn around chopsticks. Despite the cheerful summer-camp atmosphere, the event was a reminder of the binary choice facing smartphone owners, who, according to one study, consult their device 150 times a day: Leave the WMD on and deal with relentless prompts compelling them to check its screen, or else completely disconnect. “It doesn’t have to be the all-or-nothing choice,” Harris told me after taking in the arts-and-crafts scene. “That’s a design failure.” Harris is the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience. As the co‑founder of Time Well Spent, an advocacy group, he is trying to bring moral integrity to software design: essentially, to persuade the tech world to help us disengage more easily from its devices. While some blame our collective tech addiction on personal failings, like weak willpower, Harris points a finger at the software itself. That itch to glance at our phone is a natural reaction to apps and websites engineered to get us scrolling as frequently as possible. The attention economy, which showers profits on companies that seize our focus, has kicked off what Harris calls a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” “You could say that it’s my responsibility” to exert self-control when it comes to digital usage, he explains, “but that’s not acknowledging that there’s a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job is to break down whatever responsibility I can maintain.” In short, we’ve lost control of our relationship with technology because technology has become better at controlling us. A “Hippocratic oath” for software designers would stop the exploitation of people’s psychological vulnerabilities. Under the auspices of Time Well Spent, Harris is leading a movement to change the fundamentals of software design. He is rallying product designers to adopt a “Hippocratic oath” for software that, he explains, would check the practice of “exposing people’s psychological vulnerabilities” and restore “agency” to users. “There needs to be new ratings, new criteria, new design standards, new certification standards,” he says. “There is a way to design based not on addiction.” Joe Edelman—who did much of the research informing Time Well Spent’s vision and is the co-director of a think tank advocating for more-respectful software design—likens Harris to a tech-focused Ralph Nader. Other people, including Adam Alter, a marketing professor at NYU, have championed theses similar to Harris’s; but according to Josh Elman, a Silicon Valley veteran with the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners, Harris is “the first putting it together in this way”—articulating the problem, its societal cost, and ideas for tackling it. Elman compares the tech industry to Big Tobacco before the link between cigarettes and cancer was established: keen to give customers more of what they want, yet simultaneously inflicting collateral damage on their lives. Harris, Elman says, is offering Silicon Valley a chance to reevaluate before more-immersive technology, like virtual reality, pushes us beyond a point of no return. All this talk of hacking human psychology could sound paranoid, if Harris had not witnessed the manipulation firsthand. Raised in the Bay Area by a single mother employed as an advocate for injured workers, Harris spent his childhood creating simple software for Macintosh computers and writing fan mail to Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple. He studied computer science at Stanford while interning at Apple, then embarked on a master’s degree at Stanford, where he joined the Persuasive Technology Lab. Run by the experimental psychologist B. J. Fogg, the lab has earned a cultlike following among entrepreneurs hoping to master Fogg’s principles of “behavior design”—a euphemism for what sometimes amounts to building software that nudges us toward the habits a company seeks to instill. (One of Instagram’s co-founders is an alumnus.) In Fogg’s course, Harris studied the psychology of behavior change, such as how clicker training for dogs, among other methods of conditioning, can inspire products for people. For example, rewarding someone with an instantaneous “like” after they post a photo can reinforce the action, and potentially shift it from an occasional to a daily activity. Harris learned that the most-successful sites and apps hook us by tapping into deep-seated human needs. When LinkedIn launched, for instance, it created a hub-and-spoke icon to visually represent the size of each user’s network. That triggered people’s innate craving for social approval and, in turn, got them scrambling to connect. “Even though at the time there was nothing useful you could do with LinkedIn, that simple icon had a powerful effect in tapping into people’s desire not to look like losers,” Fogg told me. Harris began to see that technology is not, as so many engineers claim, a neutral tool; rather, it’s capable of coaxing us to act in certain ways. And he was troubled that out of 10 sessions in Fogg’s course, only one addressed the ethics of these persuasive tactics. (Fogg says that topic is “woven throughout” the curriculum.) From Our November 2016 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe Harris dropped out of the master’s program to launch a start-up that installed explanatory pop-ups across thousands of sites, including The New York Times’. It was his first direct exposure to the war being waged for our time, and Harris felt torn between his company’s social mission, which was to spark curiosity by making facts easily accessible, and pressure from publishers to corral users into spending more and more minutes on their sites. Though Harris insists he steered clear of persuasive tactics, he grew more familiar with how they were applied. He came to conceive of them as “hijacking techniques”—the digital version of pumping sugar, salt, and fat into junk food in order to induce bingeing. McDonald’s hooks us by appealing to our bodies’ craving for certain flavors; Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter hook us by delivering what psychologists call “variable rewards.” Messages, photos, and “likes” appear on no set schedule, so we check for them compulsively, never sure when we’ll receive that dopamine-activating prize. (Delivering rewards at random has been proved to quickly and strongly reinforce behavior.) Checking that Facebook friend request will take only a few seconds, we reason, though research shows that when interrupted, people take an average of 25 minutes to return to their original task. Sites foster a sort of distracted lingering partly by lumping multiple services together. To answer the friend request, we’ll pass by the News Feed, where pictures and auto-play videos seduce us into scrolling through an infinite stream of posts—what Harris calls a “bottomless bowl,” referring to a study that found people eat 73 percent more soup out of self-refilling bowls than out of regular ones, without realizing they’ve consumed extra. The “friend request” tab will nudge us to add even more contacts by suggesting “people you may know,” and in a split second, our unconscious impulses cause the cycle to continue: Once we send the friend request, an alert appears on the recipient’s phone in bright red—a “trigger” color, Harris says, more likely than some other hues to make people click—and because seeing our name taps into a hardwired sense of social obligation, she will drop everything to answer. In the end, he says, companies “stand back watching as a billion people run around like chickens with their heads cut off, responding to each other and feeling indebted to each other.” A Facebook spokesperson told me the social network focuses on maximizing the quality of the experience—not the time its users spend on the site—and surveys its users daily to gauge success. In response to this feedback, Facebook recently tweaked its News Feed algorithm to punish clickbait—stories with sensationalist headlines designed to attract readers. (LinkedIn and Instagram declined requests for comment. Twitter did not reply to multiple queries.) Even so, a niche group of consultants has emerged to teach companies how to make their services irresistible. One such guru is Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, who has lectured or consulted for firms such as LinkedIn and Instagram. A blog post he wrote touting the value of variable rewards is titled “Want to Hook Your Users? Drive Them Crazy.” While asserting that companies are morally obligated to help those genuinely addicted to their services, Eyal contends that social media merely satisfies our appetite for entertainment in the same way TV or novels do, and that the latest technology tends to get vilified simply because it’s new, but eventually people find balance. “Saying ‘Don’t use these techniques’ is essentially saying ‘Don’t make your products fun to use.’ That’s silly,” Eyal told me. “With every new technology, the older generation says ‘Kids these days are using too much of this and too much of that and it’s melting their brains.’ And it turns out that what we’ve always done is to adapt.” Google acquired Harris’s company in 2011, and he ended up working on Gmail’s Inbox app. (He’s quick to note that while he was there, it was never an explicit goal to increase time spent on Gmail.) A year into his tenure, Harris grew concerned about the failure to consider how seemingly minor design choices, such as having phones buzz with each new email, would cascade into billions of interruptions. His team dedicated months to fine-tuning the aesthetics of the Gmail app with the aim of building a more “delightful” email experience. But to him that missed the bigger picture: Instead of trying to improve email, why not ask how email could improve our lives—or, for that matter, whether each design decision was making our lives worse? Harris gives off a preppy-hippie vibe that allows him to move comfortably between Palo Alto boardrooms and device-free retreats. (Olaf Blecker) Six months after attending Burning Man in the Nevada desert, a trip Harris says helped him with “waking up and questioning my own beliefs,” he quietly released “A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention,” a 144-page Google Slides presentation. In it, he declared, “Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25–35) working at 3 companies”—Google, Apple, and Facebook—“had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention … We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.” Although Harris sent the presentation to just 10 of his closest colleagues, it quickly spread to more than 5,000 Google employees, including then-CEO Larry Page, who discussed it with Harris in a meeting a year later. “It sparked something,” recalls Mamie Rheingold, a former Google staffer who organized an internal Q&A session with Harris at the company’s headquarters. “He did successfully create a dialogue and open conversation about this in the company.” Harris parlayed his presentation into a position as product philosopher, which involved researching ways Google could adopt ethical design. But he says he came up against “inertia.” Product road maps had to be followed, and fixing tools that were obviously broken took precedence over systematically rethinking services. Chris Messina, then a designer at Google, says little changed following the release of Harris’s slides: “It was one of those things where there’s a lot of head nods, and then people go back to work.” Harris told me some colleagues misinterpreted his message, thinking that he was proposing banning people from social media, or that the solution was simply sending fewer notifications. (Google declined to comment.) Harris left the company last December to push for change more widely, buoyed by a growing network of supporters that includes the MIT professor Sherry Turkle; Meetup’s CEO, Scott Heiferman; and Justin Rosenstein, a co-inventor of the “like” button; along with fed-up users and concerned employees across the industry. “Pretty much every big company that’s manipulating users has been very interested in our work,” says Joe Edelman, who has spent the past five years trading ideas and leading workshops with Harris. Through Time Well Spent, his advocacy group, Harris hopes to mobilize support for what he likens to an organic-food movement, but for software: an alternative built around core values, chief of which is helping us spend our time well, instead of demanding more of it. Thus far, Time Well Spent is more a label for his crusade—and a vision he hopes others will embrace—than a full-blown organization. (Harris, its sole employee, self-funds it.) Yet he’s amassed a network of volunteers keen to get involved, thanks in part to his frequent cameos on the thought-leader speaker circuit, including talks at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society; the O’Reilly Design Conference; an internal meeting of Facebook designers; and a TEDx event, whose video has been viewed more than 1 million times online. Tim O’Reilly, the founder of O’Reilly Media and an early web pioneer, told me Harris’s ideas are “definitely something that people who are influential are listening to and thinking about.” Even Fogg, who stopped wearing his Apple Watch because its incessant notifications annoyed him, is a fan of Harris’s work: “It’s a brave thing to do and a hard thing to do.” At Unplug SF, a burly man calling himself “Haus” enveloped Harris in a bear hug. “This is the antidote!,” Haus cheered. “This is the antivenom!” All evening, I watched people pull Harris aside to say hello, or ask to schedule a meeting. Someone cornered Harris to tell him about his internet “sabbatical,” but Harris cut him off. “For me this is w‑talk,” he protested. Harris admits that researching the ways our time gets hijacked has made him slightly obsessive about evaluating what counts as “time well spent” in his own life. The hypnosis class Harris went to before meeting me—because he suspects the passive state we enter while scrolling through feeds is similar to being hypnotized—was not time well spent. The slow-moving course, he told me, was “low bit rate”—a technical term for data-transfer speeds. Attending the digital detox? Time very well spent. He was delighted to get swept up in a mass game of rock-paper-scissors, where a series of one-on-one elimination contests culminated in an onstage showdown between “Joe” and “Moonlight.” Harris has a tendency to immerse himself in a single activity at a time. In conversation, he rarely breaks eye contact and will occasionally rest a hand on his interlocutor’s arm, as if to keep both parties present in the moment. He got so wrapped up in our chat one afternoon that he attempted to get into an idling Uber that was not an Uber at all, but a car that had paused at a stop sign. An accordion player and tango dancer in his spare time who pairs plaid shirts with a bracelet that has presence stamped into a silver charm, Harris gives off a preppy-hippie vibe that allows him to move comfortably between Palo Alto boardrooms and device-free retreats. In that sense, he had a great deal in common with the other Unplug SF attendees, many of whom belong to a new class of tech elites “waking up” to their industry’s unwelcome side effects. For many entrepreneurs, this epiphany has come with age, children, and the peace of mind of having several million in the bank, says Soren Gordhamer, the creator of Wisdom 2.0, a conference series about maintaining “presence and purpose” in the digital age. “They feel guilty,” Gordhamer says. “They are realizing they built this thing that’s so addictive.” I asked Harris whether he felt guilty about having joined Google, which has inserted its technology into our pockets, glasses, watches, and cars. He didn’t. He acknowledged that some divisions, such as YouTube, benefit from coaxing us to stare at our screens. But he justified his decision to work there with the logic that since Google controls three interfaces through which millions engage with technology—Gmail, Android, and Chrome—the company was the “first line of defense.” Getting Google to rethink those products, as he’d attempted to do, had the potential to transform our online experience. Snapchat’s tactics for hooking users may make Facebook’s look quaint. At a restaurant around the corner from Unplug SF, Harris demonstrated an alternative way of interacting with WMDs, based on his own self-defense tactics. Certain tips were intuitive: He’s “almost militaristic about turning off notifications” on his iPhone, and he set a custom vibration pattern for text messages, so he can feel the difference between an automated alert and a human’s words. Other tips drew on Harris’s study of psychology. Since merely glimpsing an app’s icon will “trigger this whole set of sensations and thoughts,” he pruned the first screen of his phone to include only apps, such as Uber and Google Maps, that perform a single function and thus run a low risk of “bottomless bowl–ing.” He tried to make his phone look minimalist: Taking a cue from a Google experiment that cut employees’ M&M snacking by moving the candy from clear to opaque containers, he buried colorful icons—along with time-sucking apps like Gmail and WhatsApp—inside folders on the second page of his iPhone. As a result, that screen was practically grayscale. Harris launches apps by using what he calls the phone’s “consciousness filter”—typing Instagram, say, into its search bar—which reduces impulsive tapping. For similar reasons, Harris keeps a Post-it on his laptop with this instruction: “Do not open without intention.” His approach seems to have worked. I’m usually quick to be annoyed by friends reaching for their phones, but next to Harris, I felt like an addict. Wary of being judged, I made a point not to check my iPhone unless he checked his first, but he went so long without peeking that I started getting antsy. Harris assured me that I was far from an exception. “Our generation relies on our phones for our moment-to-moment choices about who we’re hanging out with, what we should be thinking about, who we owe a response to, and what’s important in our lives,” he said. “And if that’s the thing that you’ll outsource your thoughts to, forget the brain implant. That is the brain implant. You refer to it all the time.” Curious to hear more about Harris’s plan for tackling manipulative software, I tagged along one morning to his meeting with two entrepreneurs eager to incorporate Time Well Spent values into their start-up. Harris, flushed from a yoga class, met me at a bakery not far from the “intentional community house” where he lives with a dozen or so housemates. We were joined by Micha Mikailian and Johnny Chan, the co-founders of an ad blocker, Intently, that replaces advertising with “intentions” reminding people to “Follow Your Bliss” or “Be Present.” Previously, they’d run a marketing and advertising agency. “One day I was in a meditation practice. I just got the vision for Intently,” said Mikailian, who sported a chunky turquoise bracelet and a man bun. “It fully aligned with my purpose,” said Chan. They were interested in learning what it would take to integrate ethical design. Coordinating loosely with Joe Edelman, Harris is developing a code of conduct—the Hippocratic oath for software designers—and a playbook of best practices that can guide start-ups and corporations toward products that “treat people with respect.” Having companies rethink the metrics by which they measure success would be a start. “You have to imagine: What are the concrete benefits landed in space and in time in a person’s life?,” Harris said, coaching Mikailian and Chan. Harris hopes that companies will offer a healthier alternative to the current diet of tech junk food—perhaps at a premium price. At his speaking engagements, Harris has presented prototype products that embody other principles of ethical design. He argues that technology should help us set boundaries. This could be achieved by, for example, an inbox that asks how much time we want to dedicate to email, then gently reminds us when we’ve exceeded our quota. Technology should give us the ability to see where our time goes, so we can make informed decisions—imagine your phone alerting you when you’ve unlocked it for the 14th time in an hour. And technology should help us meet our goals, give us control over our relationships, and enable us to disengage without anxiety. Harris has demoed a hypothetical “focus mode” for Gmail that would pause incoming messages until someone has finished concentrating on a task, while allowing interruptions in case of an emergency. (Slack has implemented a similar feature.) Harris hopes to create a Time Well Spent certification—akin to the leed seal or an organic label—that would designate software made with those values in mind. He already has a shortlist of apps that he endorses as early exemplars of the ethos, such as Pocket, Calendly, and f.lux, which, respectively, saves articles for future reading, lets people book empty slots on an individual’s calendar to streamline the process of scheduling meetings, and aims to improve sleep quality by adding a pinkish cast to the circadian-rhythm-disrupting blue light of screens. Intently could potentially join this coalition, he volunteered. As a first step toward identifying other services that could qualify, Harris has experimented with creating software that would capture how many hours someone devotes weekly to each app on her phone, then ask her which ones were worthwhile. The data could be compiled to create a leaderboard that shames apps that addict but fail to satisfy. Edelman has released a related tool for websites, called Hindsight. “We have to change what it means to win,” Harris says. The biggest obstacle to incorporating ethical design and “agency” is not technical complexity. According to Harris, it’s a “will thing.” And on that front, even his supporters worry that the culture of Silicon Valley may be inherently at odds with anything that undermines engagement or growth. “This is not the place where people tend to want to slow down and be deliberate about their actions and how their actions impact others,” says Jason Fried, who has spent the past 12 years running Basecamp, a project-management tool. “They want to make things more sugary and more tasty, and pull you in, and justify billions of dollars of valuation and hundreds of millions of dollars [in] VC funds.” Rather than dismantling the entire attention economy, Harris hopes that companies will, at the very least, create a healthier alternative to the current diet of tech junk food. He recognizes that this shift would require reevaluating entrenched business models so success no longer hinges on claiming attention and time. As with organic vegetables, it’s possible that the first generation of Time Well Spent software might be available at a premium price, to make up for lost advertising dollars. “Would you pay $7 a month for a version of Facebook that was built entirely to empower you to live your life?,” Harris says. “I think a lot of people would pay for that.” Like splurging on grass-fed beef, paying for services that are available for free and disconnecting for days (even hours) at a time are luxuries that few but the reasonably well-off can afford. I asked Harris whether this risked stratifying tech consumption, such that the privileged escape the mental hijacking and everyone else remains subjected to it. “It creates a new inequality. It does,” Harris admitted. But he countered that if his movement gains steam, broader change could occur, much in the way Walmart now stocks organic produce. Currently, though, the trend is toward deeper manipulation in ever more sophisticated forms. Harris fears that Snapchat’s tactics for hooking users make Facebook’s look quaint. Facebook automatically tells a message’s sender when the recipient reads the note—a design choice that, per Fogg’s logic, activates our hardwired sense of social reciprocity and encourages the recipient to respond. Snapchat ups the ante: Unless the default settings are changed, users are informed the instant a friend begins typing a message to them—which effectively makes it a faux pas not to finish a message you start. Harris worries that the app’s Snapstreak feature, which displays how many days in a row two friends have snapped each other and rewards their loyalty with an emoji, seems to have been pulled straight from Fogg’s inventory of persuasive tactics. Research shared with Harris by Emily Weinstein, a Harvard doctoral candidate, shows that Snapstreak is driving some teenagers nuts—to the point that before going on vacation, they give friends their log-in information and beg them to snap in their stead. “To be honest, it made me sick to my stomach to hear these anecdotes,” Harris told me. Harris thinks his best shot at improving the status quo is to get users riled up about the ways they’re being manipulated, then create a groundswell of support for technology that respects people’s agency—something akin to the privacy outcry that prodded companies to roll out personal-information protections. While Harris’s experience at Google convinced him that users must demand change for it to happen, Edelman suggests that the incentive to adapt can originate within the industry, as engineers become reluctant to build products they view as unethical and companies face a brain drain. The more people recognize the repercussions of tech firms’ persuasive tactics, the more working there “becomes uncool,” he says, a view I heard echoed by others in his field. “You can really burn through engineers hard.” There is arguably an element of hypocrisy to the enlightened image that Silicon Valley projects, especially with its recent embrace of “mindfulness.” Companies like Google and Facebook, which have offered mindfulness training and meditation spaces for their employees, position themselves as corporate leaders in this movement. Yet this emphasis on mindfulness and consciousness, which has extended far beyond the tech world, puts the burden on users to train their focus, without acknowledging that the devices in their hands are engineered to chip away at their concentration. It’s like telling people to get healthy by exercising more, then offering the choice between a Big Mac and a Quarter Pounder when they sit down for a meal. And being aware of software’s seductive power does not mean being immune to its influence. One evening, just as we were about to part ways for the night, Harris stood talking by his car when his phone flashed with a new text message. He glanced down at the screen and interrupted himself mid-sentence. “Oh!” he announced, more to his phone than to me, and mumbled something about what a coincidence it was that the person texting him knew his friend. He looked back up sheepishly. “That’s a great example,” he said, waving his phone. “I had no control over the process.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Art of Interviewing Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg on his conversations with the controversial American statesman Leah Varjacques Nov 11, 2016 About the Author Bianca Bosker is the author of Original Copies and the forthcoming Cork Dork.

Author’s note (November 10, 2016): Over the past several months, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, numerous times on the subject of America’s role in the world. Our conversations took place before this week’s election, but were informed by the foreign-policy differences between the candidates. The December 2016 issue of The Atlantic includes my article on these conversations, which you will  find published below. In addition, a full rendering of our several interviews, on subjects including the future of Russia, the rise of China, and the chaos of the Middle East, can be found here. On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction).

In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U.S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families, mixed-race families, minorities, and same-sex couples. Our sports teams are multi-cultural, diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success—however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t—many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out—and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news.” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary; I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have—and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams.

The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadn’t meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasn’t new for me. A few weeks earlier, I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office, and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep, the same tiredness that came on when, as a child, I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But he had a clue it might. Four years ago, Arnade traded in a Wall Street job for a life of semi-transience, photographing addiction and poverty in the South Bronx. After a few years, he decided to take his project national. “I wanted to see if what I saw there was true across the rest of America,” he told me on the phone this week. Over the past two years, Arnade put over 100,000 miles on his car traveling through “overlooked” American towns with names that sound nearly fictional: Kingsport, Tennessee; Natchitoches, Louisiana; Mingo, West Virginia. He photographs and tweets about the people he meets, begetting a mosaic of a divided and frustrated country during the rise of Trump. “It was almost accidental that I got into the Donald Trump thing,” he says with a laugh.

The Watergate Babies—as the recently elected Democratic congressmen were known—were young, idealistic liberals who had been swept into office on a promise to clean up government, end the war in Vietnam, and rid the nation’s capital of the kind of corruption and dirty politics the Nixon White House had wrought. Richard Nixon himself had resigned just a few months earlier in August. But the Watergate Babies didn’t just campaign against Nixon; they took on the Democratic establishment, too.

So outside organizations are lending a hand. John Locher / AP Most Popular Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Will Grow, and Grow, and Grow Andrew McGill Nov 12, 2016 The U.S. Media Is Completely Unprepared to Cover a Trump Presidency Adam Serwer Nov 11, 2016 The Lessons of Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg Nov 10, 2016 The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams May 16, 2016 ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner Nov 11, 2016 Priscilla Alvarez Oct 8, 2016 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The Latino population in the United States reached nearly 57 million in 2015 and according to U.S. Census Bureau projections, it’s expected to increase to 119 million by 2060. But just how much influence Latino voters will bring to bear on future elections is hard to assess. Latinos have historically been the least likely group of voters in the country to cast a ballot, but this year’s contentious election might serve as a turning point in their turnout. A number of organizations are hoping to capitalize on increased interest in the election by launching initiatives specifically designed to help Latinos register to vote.   In 2012, 48 percent of eligible Latino voters cast a ballot, compared with roughly 66 percent of black voters and 64 percent of white voters. But their voting habits may be changing: Latino voter registration is reportedly climbing in Colorado, Florida, and Nevada, three important swing states. And on the night of the first presidential debate in September, the search term “registrarse para votar”—translated to “register to vote” in English—spiked on Google, reaching the highest level ever seen in the United States. Areas with a high concentration of Latinos—like California, Texas, and Florida—saw the biggest jump in searches for “registrarse para votar.” Latest from Politics The Tech White Power Used to Go Viral Ahead of next month’s election, voter organizations are promoting registration in ways that are catered to the Latino electorate and their proclivities. One such group is Phone2Action, a civic engagement platform that launched an app on Voter Registration Day, September 27, that capitalizes on Latinos’ dependency on mobile devices. A Pew Research Center survey released in July found that 94 percent of Latinos said they access the Internet through a mobile device—a higher percentage than among white users—and a 2015 Nielsen report found that Latinos use “more mobile minutes than average device users.” The Phone2Action tool, also available on desktop, allows users to check their registration, find information about early voting and polling locations, and learn more about presidential and down-ballot candidates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Consumer Technology Association, and National Association of Manufacturers are among those who have partnered with Phone2Action to offer the app on their websites. Recent data seems to affirm Phone2Action’s strategy: Since National Voter Registration Day—which was heavily promoted on Google, Facebook, and the nation’s largest Spanish-language network, Univision—searches for “registrarse para votar” have been largely conducted on mobile. According to Google trends data, 87 percent of searches were on a mobile device, compared with 13 percent of searches on a desktop computer. Meanwhile, search interest for “register to vote” stood at 76 percent on mobile and 24 percent on desktop. Other voter organizations are also working to mobilize Latinos. Voto Latino, a nonpartisan group that focuses on engaging young Latinos, announced this month that its outreach efforts have so far resulted in 101,720 voter registrations. President and CEO Maria Teresa Kumar said in a statement that the group’s “digital-first strategy of engaging young Latinos has led to more than 5,000 voter registrations per day in the last weeks.” National Council of La Raza and Mi Familia Vota, two organizations that focus on Latino voter participation, are also deploying efforts to increase turnout. Latino outreach efforts could have a lopsided benefit for Hillary Clinton, whose opponent has used inflammatory language about Latinos and proposed policies that would directly impact the immigrant community. Donald Trump launched his campaign calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. More than a year later, after the first debate, he doubled-down on his past criticisms of Venezuelan-born Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe. Trump’s campaign has ostensibly tried to land Latino voters through his National Hispanic Advisory Council, but even that effort has come with its hiccups. Following his recent speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona—where he demonstrated a continuing hardline stance on deportations and border security—some members decided to leave the group. Clinton’s Latino outreach has also fallen short, though, when compared with President Obama’s strategy in 2012—and these initiatives could help compensate for any deficiencies. The Clinton camp has been criticized, for example, for the rollout of its Latino targeting efforts; staffers waited until only recently to release ads directed toward Spanish speakers in some states. Still, as BuzzFeed reports, Obama may have spent more than Clinton on paid Spanish-language media, but he wasn’t facing Trump—a man whose rhetoric on the trail alone has alienated Latinos. Generally speaking, Democrats stand to gain more from increased Latino voter registration. According to a Pew survey from 2014, “half of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party has more concern for Latinos than the Republican Party.” In 2012, Barack Obama received overwhelming support from Latino voters: Seventy-one percent of Latino voters cast a ballot for Obama compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. The dismal showing for the then-Republican nominee alarmed the GOP. After the election, the party released its so-called autopsy report, which called for a greater emphasis on minority outreach. Years later, Trump’s candidacy appears to have hindered those efforts, as he trails behind Clinton among Latino voters. In a Univision poll released last month, the Democratic nominee held a commanding lead among Latino voters in battleground states. A Fox News Latino poll showed Clinton 46 points ahead of Trump among Latinos nationwide. Across the board, private, seemingly apolitical companies are assisting in voter registration this year. Facebook, for example, launched its first voter registration drive in September. Uber, in partnership with Google, has pushed out registration information via email and social-media campaigns. “This is a historic election and we plan to spend the weeks leading up to Election Day making sure every eligible Uber rider and driver has the opportunity to get involved,” the company said in a statement. Despite low Latino voter turnout in the past, the NALEO Educational Fund projects the number of Latinos expected to go to the polls in November to increase by 17 percent, up from 8.7 percent in 2012. Google-search spikes and an uptick in some states’ voter registration could be early hints at increased interest among Latinos. But whether those searches and visits will translate to votes on Election Day is a whole different story.

Instead, Hillary Clinton failed to turn out liberal voters who had previously voted for Barack Obama. It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency. Continue Reading Joshua Roberts / Reuters The U.S. Media Is Completely Unprepared to Cover a Trump Presidency Adam Serwer Donald Trump and his surrogates have shown an uncanny ability to lie in the face of objective facts. They will now have the power of the federal government to help them. Saddam Hussein was allied with al-Qaeda, and helped finance the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The Hussein regime had sought uranium from Niger. Iraq had obtained aluminum tubes to be used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. All of those assertions turned out to be false. But they echoed throughout the press in the months-long run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and only after the war turned to disaster did the media engage in soul-searching and self-criticism. And even then, many sought to deflect blame. Judith Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter whose front-page story about the aluminum tubes bolstered the case for war in Iraq explained: “My job isn’t to assess the government’s information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of The New York Times what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.” Continue Reading Win McNamee / Getty The Lessons of Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg The legendary and controversial statesman criticizes the Obama Doctrine, talks about the main challenges for the next president, and explains how to avoid war with China. Author’s note (November 10, 2016): Over the past several months, I’ve interviewed Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, numerous times on the subject of America’s role in the world. Our conversations took place before this week’s election, but were informed by the foreign-policy differences between the candidates. The December 2016 issue of The Atlantic includes my article on these conversations, which you will  find published below. In addition, a full rendering of our several interviews, on subjects including the future of Russia, the rise of China, and the chaos of the Middle East, can be found here. On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction). Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Kena Betancur / AFP / Getty ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner None A Trump voter describes his worldview in great detail, and despite his blunt quote above, his note is more nuanced and perhaps more relatable than you think: I am Southern. I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U.S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families, mixed-race families, minorities, and same-sex couples. Our sports teams are multi-cultural, diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success—however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t—many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out—and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news.” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary; I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have—and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams. I voted for the wrecking ball—and I feel better about it now than I did in the booth.   Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight, or sleep Last month, my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests—the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships.

A shoplifter was caught and then prosecuted for stealing £60 ($104) of washing-up goods after she was photographed fleeing a store on Google Street View. Tammy McIvor, from Middlesbrough, can be seen running from discount store Savers in the town with a member of staff chasing her. Images of the robbery were stumbled across by an IT worker who saw McIvor sprinting out of the North Yorkshire shop while looking through the town online on the app. She was pictured by the camera which had been taking shots in the street, exiting from the store with her stolen goods in a Sports Direct carrier bag. Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing. She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images. 'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Continued below.

'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.' The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm. She pleaded guilty to theft at Teeside magistrates court last week and was given a year-long community order, which has a drug rehabilitation requirement. The court heard McIvor has a long history of offending and drug abuse including a stint in prison in 2013 for burgling two properties in one night. The women, who has been a heroin addict since 16, also took drugs in prison and used someone else's name to get out of trouble. After the case, a friend of McIvor, said: 'She's harmless but she gets into trouble for shoplifting quite a bit. 'A lot of the shops in Middlesbrough and Stockton already know her and look out for her, but she's never been caught like this before.

The search giant unveiled several products at its recent event in San Francisco, California, two of which are new smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event Google has “no plans” to produce another smartphone from its Nexus line, and that’s because the Pixel line marks the first time the device is completely “made by Google.” The smartphones feature tight hardware and software integration. If you have a Nexus 6P, you may be considering an upgrade to the Pixel XL. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the two Google heavyweight phablets, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new Pixel lineup. Performance Nexus 6P Google Pixel XL Size 6.27 × 3.06 × 0.29 inches (159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3mm) 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34 inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm) Weight 178 grams (6.28 ounces) 168 grams (5.93 ounces) Screen 5.7-inch AMOLED 5.5-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,440 × 2,560 pixels (515 ppi) 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (534 ppi) OS Android 7.0 Nougat (will receive Android 7.1 Nougat) Android 7.1 Nougat Storage 32GB, 64GB, 128GB 32, 128GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 3GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 8MP front Video 4K 4K Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Water resistant No No Battery 3,450mAh 3,450mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Silver, black, white, gold Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Availability Google Store unlocked Google Store unlocked, Verizon Price Starts at $500 Starts at $770 DT review Nexus 6P review Coming soon Yearly upgrades often don’t produce great differences in terms of hardware performance, and that’s reflective in the internals of the Pixel XL. It shares almost the same specs as last year’s Nexus 6P, except for a few improvements. The Pixel XL is a little smaller than the Nexus 6P, thanks to its 5.5-inch display. This means it’s a little lighter as well. The Nexus 6P has 3GB of RAM, but the Pixel XL adds an extra gigabyte. Both devices have 32 and 128GB storage options, but there is no 64GB model for the Pixel XL. Related: Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Hands on with Google’s latest and Android 7.1 The Pixel XL features the latest processor from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. In fact, it’s the first device in the U.S. to feature the processor, which is said to improve performance by 10 percent  over the Snapdragon 820. But the Nexus 6P is powered by the Snapdragon 810, an outdated processor by 2016’s standards. That’s not to say the Snapdragon 810 in the Nexus 6P doesn’t perform well. You won’t have any issues, but note that the Pixel XL features tight hardware and software integration. It’s unlike the Nexus line, where the software was designed by Google and the hardware was made by a third-party manufacturer. HTC is the manufacturer for the Pixel XL, with Google choosing the components to work with its operating system — similar to how Apple works with Foxconn to build the iPhone. You’re undoubtedly going to notice that Android performs better on the Pixel XL than on the Nexus 6P, thanks to these software and hardware integrations. Winner: Pixel XL Design, display, and durability Here’s the more subjective comparison. Personal preference applies to which smartphone looks the best, but we can say the Pixel XL felt a lot more comfortable to hold than the Nexus 6P. Its edges are more rounded and smooth. We like the “G” branding more than the large “Nexus” branding on the back of the device, and the half-glass back is certainly unique. The Nexus 6P offers stereo front-facing speakers, but the Pixel only has a speaker at the bottom edge. It also seems like the Nexus 6P may have slightly smaller bezels, but the difference is hardly noticeable. The 6P and the Pixel XL feature an AMOLED display with the same Quad HD resolution — 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. The 6P has a slightly larger display at 5.7 inches, as opposed to the 5.5-inch screen on the Pixel XL. You won’t notice much of a difference here, but we’ll have wait until we can review the Pixel XL for final judgment. Related: What smart home devices will work with Google Home when it debuts November 4? Both devices should have similar durability ratings thanks to the use of Gorilla Glass 4 — be aware  that there’s potentially more glass to crack on the back of the Pixel than on the 6P if you drop it. And they’re not water resistant, so don’t expect to take them swimming. In addition silver and black variants, the Nexus 6P comes in two more colors — gold and white. The Pixel has a black and silver option, but it also offers a unique “really blue” variant. It’s not often you see a blue phone, so a point goes to the Pixel. It’s a tough call, but we think the Pixel’s glass back looks better than the glass visor on the 6P. Winner: Pixel XL Battery Both smartphones have the exact same battery size, but Google claims the Pixel XL has longer battery life thanks to better control over hardware and software. The Nexus 6P has a standby time up to around 18 days, whereas the Pixel XL can go on standby for 23 days. Read More Internet use time for the Nexus 6P is around 10 hours on Wi-Fi, and 10 hours on LTE. For the Pixel XL, you can add 4 more hours on both Wi-Fi and LTE. Winner: Pixel XL Camera One highlight Google is pushing for the Pixel smartphones is the camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone camera. The experience was built from the ground up, with a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for video, improved HDR+ that processes incredibly fast, and one of the fastest capture times Google has clocked in its various tests. We tested the camera at the San Francisco event and it snapped pictures in succession at much faster speeds than the 6P. The Pixel also had a faster HDR+ processing speed. Google is also offering several Pro features in the camera, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. Related: Google Pixel vs. Apple iPhone 7: Can new Google phone take down its enemy? Pixel owners also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This is already an option in Google Photos, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. Both phones have the same megapixel count on both the front and rear cameras, but megapixels aren’t as much of a factor as software optimization. If anything, the unlimited, full resolution photo storage feature alone makes it a no-brainer to opt for the Pixel camera, rather than the Nexus 6P’s camera. Winner: Pixel XL Software The Pixel smartphones come equipped with the latest version of Android: 7.1 Nougat. The Nexus 6P is running Android 7.0 Nougat and will receive the beta version of 7.1 in November, when the Pixels launch. But that doesn’t mean the Nexus 6P is going to have the same software as the Pixel. There are several Pixel-exclusive features, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher are only on the Pixel. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. Related: What you need to know about Google’s Pixel software, and what’s in Android 7.1 Nougat Notably, there are a few features coming to other Android phones in 7.1: Night Light, a night mode; Launcher Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer and more; Daydream VR support, and other seamless updates. You can read more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here, but it’s always going to be a surefire win for the Pixel line. Winner: Pixel XL Pricing and availability Google is aiming for the big guns with its Pixel line — Samsung and Apple. Its devices are priced accordingly as well. The base 32GB Pixel XL costs $769 and the 128GB model costs $869. At the time of launch, the Nexus 6P was $500 for the 32GB model — markedly cheaper. Still, Google offers device financing from the Google Store, where you can pay off the phone in monthly payments over the course of 24 months. This was not available for the Nexus 6P, which is no longer for sale on the Google Store. You can pre-order the Pixel XL from the Google Store unlocked, and Verizon and Best Buy are selling the device as well.  The Nexus 6P is still available from third-party retailers like Amazon. Winner: Nexus 6P Overall winner: Pixel XL Sure, the Pixel XL’s price is quite a jump from the Nexus 6P, but strong software and hardware integration alone may be enough to warrant it. You’re getting the very best of Android, fast updates, 24/7 support, a much improved camera and internal specs, as well as unlimited, full resolution photo storage from Google Photos. You’re also getting a better battery life, though we’ll have to test Google’s claim once we get a review unit. Related: Friends? Not anymore. Google wants you to bow down and meet your master You should buy the Pixel XL if you’re deciding between the two, but if you’re thinking about upgrading, that’s a different question. You won’t see a huge increase in performance (except for the camera, maybe), but it depends if you want access to Assistant. You can still use Assistant via Google Allo, a messaging app, or by purchasing a Google Home. There is speculation that Google is looking to manufacture its own chips for its future products so that it won’t have to rely on HTC or other manufacturers. If that’s true, we may see even tighter software and hardware integration, and something truly special for Android in the next year or so. You can always hold out until then, but don’t expect the price to drop. Google’s aiming for the high-end market for sure, as Rick Osterloh, head of the hardware department at Google, says as in his interview with Recode.

It is part of the job. By Matt McCue Images courtesy of Sam Stubblefield 0 8 Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Amid a corporate arms race to attract talent, companies are building some pretty tricked-out offices these days. NBBJ architect Sam Stubblefield knows this well. He has helped design the headquarters for Google and Amazon. But as companies have added more OMG! amenities to their campuses, Stubblefield has developed into a bit of a contrarian. When someone asks him what is the next cool thing they can do to expand their office footprint, Stubblefield replies with, What is the last thing you can do to avoid building? “It’s so hard to go to Google and say, ‘You’ve got all of this land, but I wouldn’t build a building. I’d turn it into a nature preserve,” says Stubblefield. His recommendation to sprawling companies is to figure out how to get people working in shifts and largely from home. “That is basically talking our company out of projects, but, if that is the right choice, you have to do that,” he says.  The Seattle-based Stubblefield’s antithetical way of thinking extends to other topics as well, whether it’s establishing a killer design team with people from outside the field, turning city streets into public parks, or taking months off every year to focus on making art. We recently spoke with him about the need for creatives to look at the world from a different perspective than most. When you’re conceptualizing a building, where does your creative process begin? It goes way beyond architecture. I’m interested in how employees feel when they turn off their alarm clock every morning. What sort of head space are they in? What headspace are they in on their commute to work? I want to know what their entire day is like, every detail of it. How they feel when they walk out of their office building? Everything they associate with it. We need to think at that level. If we relegate it to space, I think we will be disappointed. Stubblefield had a hand in designing Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle. Your design teams are typically composed of people from diverse backgrounds, not just superstar architects. Why? We have a lot of doctors and nurses on staff here at NBBJ and it dramatically impacts our work. I love the idea of walking into a room where I have a badass technical architect, a nurse, and me and my background in fine art, and we’re going to go tackle an urban design problem for a civic project. You get outcomes that will be really different than if you had three people who studied similar architecture and graduated from similar schools. You have little or no chance of getting something really wild out of that group. It will get done, probably faster, probably easier, but it’s rare that you get something that is phenomenally different. If you have three people who studied similar architecture and graduated from similar schools, you have little chance of getting something wild out of that group. How does this approach impact how you hire? When we hire, we are looking for people who have two deep practices. Deep is admittedly a subjective term, but we think of it like Pi – have two good legs to stand on. For example, a former student of mine got a degree in both music and architecture at UC Berkeley, and then she decided to create music/sounds specifically for places. She has two deep practices, but she also has a squiggle across the top – the wavy symbol which says to me that that person can figure it out because they’re entrepreneurial, creative, and not too rigid. You can put any of those people against a problem, and you’ll often get a useful solution out of it.  If you don’t currently want to create buildings, where do you see the biggest opportunity for new work?  The biggest influencer to architecture right now will be human transportation. If you start to do the math, self-driving cars are going to happen. As we’re seeing people migrate to the cities, self-driving cars can reshape streets as we know them. What if pushing cars off the road gave our cities 20 percent of their streets back? How does that reshape a city? What if we turned it all into green space for a public park? It can be just trees. I walk around everywhere and my favorite thing to do is think, What if that was a strip of forest? It’s a fun thing to imagine. As we’re seeing people migrate to the cities, self-driving cars can reshape streets as we know them. Encouraging companies to use potential building space for green space and rethinking city streets as parks – how does it help a creative to look at the world from a different perspective? A creative cannot but look at the world differently. It is part of the job. But it is more than naturally having a different point of view. I think it is about actively searching for other ways, combining ideas, trying challenging approaches, generating visions, and finding other curious people to play with. I am fairly sure that it is a little bit of “bored kid” syndrome, too. The Seattle City Light, the world’s best-looking electrical substation. Tell us about your yearly work cycle, where you take several months off to make art.  I started taking a few months off every year because I had stuff that I wanted to do, but found that paying projects got in the way of more pure ideas. Nothing clever! It stayed fairly relaxed until a friend turned me onto Situationist International, a small group of artists and thinkers from Europe that emerged in the late 1950’s. This got me a little more serious about breaking patterns in work-life. The Situationists are a little extreme for my taste, but there is certainly something to learn. Alongside politics and economics, they get into architecture, film, wayfinding, graphic design, and urban design. I admire their ability to be influential without having any apparent linearity or framework. It encourages me to take time to explore the intersection of some of the things that I’m interested in, which requires time. A creative cannot but look at the world differently. It is part of the job. How do you make it work financially? The time is specifically set aside to do things that don’t need to make money, yet it is often my most productive (and sometimes most profitable) time of the year. It is normally spent planning, learning, teaching, and making. As the studio grows, it is becoming difficult to find the time. I’m just coming off a six-month artist residency here in Seattle. I was hoping to work two to three days per week in the studio, then be at the residency for the rest of the week. It ended up being five to six studio days and five to six residency days. It was 80-hour weeks for six months. Total disaster in terms of taking time to focus, but insanely productive. I know a lot more about robotics now. Really looking forward to finding more applications for that! As for how, I live fairly minimally, don’t own a car, and manage to keep things to a minimum. In lieu of higher education I decided to get some  great mentors and supplement that with the occasional class, so no school debt and an additional few years of earning. I’ve never had a credit card! Most of my money goes to travel and art projects. I don’t skimp on food. Good food is important. Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Close The Best Creative Career Insights, Delivered Weekly.

It appears that Google is actively removing the feature — I’m currently no longer seeing it on my Galaxy S7 edge — from the latest versions of the Google app… Holding down a combination (it varies by manufacturer) of the home, volume, and power buttons on most Android phones will capture a screenshot, but if you weren’t aware, Now on Tap added the ability to capture screenshots as well at some point last year. Holding the home button for Now on Tap and jumping straight to a share sheet was — in experience — the best part of the feature. But now it’s gone for many, I’m sad to report. I had it on an older version of the Google app on my Galaxy S7 edge, and it disappeared after I updated. Frankly, I don’t use Now on Tap very often, and I’m pretty glad that Google wisely decided to put the Assistant in its place on the Pixel phones (yes, I’m aware that the Now on Tap features are still there). But for those of us that are annoyingly without Assistant for a while (*cough* Nexus 6P users * cough*), it’s pretty odd that Google would remove this functionality. But I guess it is Google we’re talking about. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 8, 2016 Save for later Saved About video ads Google launches Noto, a family of fonts that covers over 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. View Caption About video ads View Caption of When your computer doesn’t recognize a language, a blank box is displayed on the screen – commonly known as a tofu. Seeing a tofu constantly is frustrating for those who find that they cannot share texts in their original scripts. Ali Eteraz, a Pakistani-American writer, wrote in a Medium post in 2013 about how nastaliq, a script from Urdu, which is a language spoken in Pakistan and India, is not supported in digital devices, so Urdu speakers must resort to pasting images of words to share texts, using other scripts, or simply writing with Western letters. “Constantly uploading image files to communicate maybe romantic (or it can make you feel like a second class digital citizen), but it is not practical,” he wrote. Recommended: Five times Internet activism made a difference On Thursday, Google announced their solution for the problem: Noto, named literally for “no more tofu,” a font family that covers more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. The project, five years in the making, is one of the biggest typography projects in recent times. It will be open source and free for download. Five times Internet activism made a difference Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we’re also very interested in keeping information alive,” Bob Jung, director of internationalization for Google said in a press release. “When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them. Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource.” Noto, a product of collaboration between Google and font company Monotype, aims to “enable global communications across borders, languages, cultures and time periods,” as stated in the press release. While some may be wary of Google’s motives – the project arguably plays right into the giant company’s ambitions for global expansion – the goal is fitting to a time when more people than ever are using the Internet. For global minorities to be welcomed to the Internet with a familiar language can be vital in encouraging accessibility. “I’m hugely excited about this because Noto is massive and it’s really an amazing public service,” Finn Bunton, assistant professor at New York University, tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview. “Companies have incentives for doing this, but this is a pretty amazing thing to be done by Google.” Professor Bunton says Noto is monumental because until now, text has been transmitted and displayed in screens only through limited codes, which means some fonts don't even offer accented characters. Since the 1990s, the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that sets standard code points for symbols, characters, and even emojis on the Internet, has worked to create unique identifiers for every glyph in written languages. “But that didn’t mean you would be able to translate that into something that you could rely on to look good, be readable and work appropriately across a huge variety of platforms,” Bunton explains. “This is what Noto has done which is so amazing.… They’ve made a consistent library where all the pieces are going to be visually harmonious and easy to read.” Figuring out the unique codes for different languages can be tough. As reported by NPR in 2014, Unicode ran into trouble when they  clumped Chinese, Japanese and Korean into one character set. “You’d get this mishmash of fonts,” Jung told WIRED in an interview. “That was always the complaint we got – fonts just don’t look good when you mix languages.” Monotype and Google worked with reviewers who are native readers of the language or experts in typography to refine the product, including a Buddhist monastery who critiqued the font and made adjustments for the Tibetan script. For some languages, this may be the first time the script has a digital presence, let alone a dedicated display font. "That in particular is something that many different language communities could not afford to do on their own,” Monotype linguistic typographer Kamal Mansour said in the press release. “Google has been the benefactor in funding this work, and in many cases, we’ve produced the first font ever to serve a particular language community. So to me, the aim is to serve that human community that would otherwise be deprived of the ability to have a digital heritage.” Next up Five times Internet activism made a difference How Saul Bass changed design Verbal energy: Going geeky over type fonts Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 An easy way to reform the Electoral College The president is commander in chief?

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleve, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

But all that is just a bunch of bluster if we can’t see actual results. Soon after Google’s event this week, Phandroid posted over 100 images taken with the search giant’s new Pixel devices. You can see all of them in the gallery above. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel camera featuring an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 micron pixels. “Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light,” Pichai added. “Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. Google’s Pixel also offers manual settings, giving users more control over exposure, white balance, and more. All of this adds up to the best smartphone camera Google has ever made. The images above certainly look impressive but as Phandroid notes a lot of them have been edited using Snapseed and VSCO Cam. We’ll get a better idea of what the pictures straight out of the Pixel when we get our hands on a retail unit later this month.

The creation of interactions will be done through the recently announced Actions on Google.  Google Assistant is an AI offering much like Amazon's Alexa. This makes Actions on Google the platform's version of Amazon's Skills.  Upon the opening of the Actions on Google program, developers will have access to Assistant's SDK. Developers will be able to create two types of requests: direct actions and conversational actions. Direct actions are suited for transactional requests such as home automation or requesting of media. Conversations on the other hand, are for tasks that require more of a back and forth interaction. Requesting an Uber, providing your destination and specifying which type of car you need would be an example. These interactions are powered by API.ai which Google acquired last month. Google Assistant is already featured in the Allo chat app and Google Home. With the opening of the platform developers will be able to integrate it into their own services and devices. Bots already built with API.ai will also be available to integrate into Assistant. It's worth noting however, that Assistant is currently only available for Pixel phones. A Google spokesperson confirmed this to TechCrunch stating, "Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year." Google has already lined up a number of parnters for the Actions on Google launch. These include Spotify and CNN for media, Uber for ride sharing, OpenTable for restaurant reservations and more. Interested developers can sign up for news and updates. About the author: Wendell Santos is the editor at ProgrammableWeb.com. You can reach him at wendell@programmableweb.com.

Tesla is opening a 65,000 square foot store, its largest retail center to date. The facility will offer sales and service of Tesla's electric car line. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Interbrand just released this year's Top 100 global brands, and Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola take this year's Top 3 spots again.  Newbies who entered the Top 100 are Tesla and fashion empire Dior. This list is based on consumer influence and brand presence. Advertisement Apple and Google have consistently been the top two global brands for the past four years, and they are still growing. Both companies respectively have seen a 5% and 11% percent growth respectively in the past year. The brand consultancy agency has been curating this list for the past 17 years, and CEO Jez Frampton says that based on the topnotchers on the list, it can be told that "the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it, They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." Tesla is a welcome addition in the respected list of the Top 100 global brands. They have proven that it's possible to grow into a super company from scratch. Especially in the auto industry, that's pretty much an impossible feat. With Elon Musk's lead, Tesla is now one of the leading brands in its sector. There are qualifications for companies to take a coveted spot on the list. According to their official website, a company must be operating in three major continents and they must have a roadmap in emerging markets. Thirty percent of the revenue must come from other countries, and fifty percent of it shouldn't come from just one continent. The Interbrand way of determining who makes the list is ISO certified as well. The qualifications are pretty strict, which makes being part of the list an even bigger privilege. Will Apple and Google still reign supreme on next year's list? With many industries going up and down, it's anybody's guess who'll be the next game changers.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google will open NY pop-up store for Pixel phone & other hardware Adam Westlake - Oct 8, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Now that Google has announced a pair of new smartphones and other additional hardware, it’s opening a similarly branded “Made by Google” physical retail location. The company has revealed it will open a pop-up store on 96 Spring Street in Manhattan, New York on October 20th, offering customers the chance to check out the hardware announced earlier this week, including the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the Google Home smart speaker, and the Google WiFi. The store listing was found on the new Made by Google website. Since it’s a ‘pop-up,’ it’s likely the location won’t be a permanent retail fixture, however there’s no details on how long it will remain open or if it will move to other cities. As the web and software giant is making a serious move into the hardware market, it makes sense for Google to have a physical retail presence. It’s a move that has been used to great success by Apple, which now has hundreds of permanent stores, and even more recently by Amazon, which has plans to open pop-ups in shopping malls to highlight its Echo and Kindle devices. This isn’t Google’s first experiment with retail stores, however. When the company was trying to launch its ill-fated Google Glass as the next big, trend-setting wearable device, it opened a handful of physical showrooms in cities like San Francisco, London, New York City, and Los Angeles.

It's been another exciting week across the tech world, with no shortage of big announcements, spicy rumors, and intriguing developments. As ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you're up to speed on what's been happening, walking you through the week's events. There's lots to get through, so let's jump right in. Things have gone from bad to worse for Yahoo in recent weeks. Last month, it announced that a massive data breach in 2014 had compromised the data of over half a billion of its users. This week, a report revealed that Yahoo had helped law enforcement agencies to monitor its users' emails en masse. Spotify users have reported that the ad-supported music streaming service has been distributing malware to devices through ads served in the app. Spotify is one of the best-known names in music streaming, but when it comes to streaming movies and TV, Netflix is often the first name that springs to mind. Netflix may soon become part of the Disney empire, as the media giant is said to be considering an acquisition. Amazon has built its own music and video services as part of its Prime subscription package, and this week, it launched another component to that offering. Amazon Prime Reading provides unlimited access to a 'rotating' collection of books, magazines and comics. Facebook relaunched an old feature this week, bringing back its long-lost Marketplace to allow users to post items for sale, and see what others nearby are selling. Facebook also launched Messenger Lite, a leaner, faster version of its popular chat app, designed for developing markets and lower-end phones. Last week, BlackBerry confirmed that it will no longer design and build its own handsets. The company had already shifted its development to Android, but it seems its older in-house BlackBerry 10 OS may live on, as it intends to license the OS to other manufacturers. Image: The Verge This stunning new handset from Sharp features a 'bezel-free' screen with curved corners that extend almost to the edge of the device. It's a first in display technology - but you won't be able to buy it just yet... Apple released its third macOS 10.12.1 Sierra beta to developers on Monday, followed by the latest developer betas of watchOS 3.1, tvOS 10.0.1 and iOS 10.1. It also rolled out iOS 10.1 Public Beta 2. Despite not supporting the third-generation Apple TV for almost a year and a half, it remained available to buy on Apple's website. Now, though, it's finally been removed from sale. Apple CEO Tim Cook seems to be a firm believer in augmented reality, saying this week that it "will happen in a big way". He said that mixed reality will eventually be as common and routine as "three meals a day". Ever feel lonely behind the wheel of your car? Toyota wants to solve that problem with a tiny robotic sidekick to accompany you on your journeys. It will be able to understand human speech and facial expressions, and interact with your car. O__O Google has been working on self-driving automotive technology for some time, but it said this week that it's not actually aiming to build its own autonomous vehicles. Instead, the company wants to develop the software that will be installed by other manufacturers for use in their self-driving cars. Google held a major launch event on Tuesday, at which it made a series of announcements, including the unveiling of several new products. Among them was the $69 Chromecast Ultra, a faster and more powerful version of its streaming device, with support for 4K resolution, HDR and Dolby Vision. The new Google WiFi router will set you back $129, or $299 for three units. The company says that it will provide optimal speeds and exceptional Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home. Google introduced its Home hub and smart speaker earlier this year at its I/O developer conference. On Tuesday, it opened pre-orders for its Amazon Echo competitor, priced at $129, offering a range of features and functionalities powered by its new digital Assistant. The Google Assistant made an appearance at Tuesday's event in a series of demos, in which the company discussed the improvements it's already made since the Assistant debuted at I/O in May. Google also announced the Daydream View, a $79 VR headset into which users will need to slot a compatible smartphone. At least 30 virtual reality games and experiences are on the way to the Daydream platform. But perhaps the most significant announcement at the event was the unveiling of Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, although most details about the two handsets had already leaked in previous weeks. They offer flagship-class specs - including what Google says is the "best smartphone camera ever" - but come with price tags to match; they cost the same as the equivalent iPhone 7 models, ranging from $649 to $869. Even so, they only have an IP53 rating for dust- and water-resistance, far less than that of the new iPhones. Google said they'd be offered in three colors - black, white and blue - but the blue option is only available in the US, and only in limited numbers. Google also promised automatic OS updates direct from the company itself, but those who purchase the new Pixels from Verizon will find that the carrier must first approve the updates before they roll out. The new phones will be the first with support for the Daydream View headset, the first to support the new Google Assistant, and the first to ship with Android 7.1 Nougat onboard. The first Android 7.1 Developer Preview is expected to arrive for other devices before the end of the year - but some software features on the new Pixels will remain exclusive to those handsets. Here's what's new in Android 7.1 Nougat. Google says that it will provide OS updates to the Pixel and Pixel XL for two years, and security patches for three years - an identical commitment to its Nexus devices - but again, far less than Apple's commitment on that front. But the launch of the new Pixel phones also signals the end of the line for Google's much-loved Nexus range. However, the company has assured users that it will "continue to support" its Nexus devices. While the Pixel and Pixel XL will ship with Android 7.1, the rollout of Android 7.0 has barely begun. Android 7.0 finally made it to the Nexus 6 earlier this week, followed by the Nexus 9 LTE a couple of days later. Google originally released Nougat back in August. Motorola announced the full list of devices that it will upgrade to Android 7.0 Nougat - but there's quite a few devices not on that list. LG's V20 will be the first device to ship with Android 7.0 onboard, and pre-orders are now available on AT&T in the US - but the $830 price tag won't appeal to everyone. ASUS' new flagship, the ZenFone 3 Deluxe, launches in the US this month too, with Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon 821 chip. The range-topper will cost $799, but less powerful ZenFone 3 variants will be available at lower prices. Sony launched its Xperia XZ flagship, and premium Xperia X Compact, in the US last month - but many potential buyers were dismayed that neither device has a working fingerprint sensor, despite that feature being offered on the two handsets in other markets. However, there is a way to work around that... It's been another bad week for Samsung, despite the company's efforts to put the saga of its fiery flagship behind it. Things started well enough as the new and improved Galaxy Note7 made its way to stores, while its recall program - to replace units potentially affected by a manufacturing flaw that causes the battery to overheat, and even explode - continues. Ongoing concerns about the safety of the Note7 led several major cruise lines this week to require passengers to keep the device switched off at all times onboard their ships. But on Wednesday, a Southwest Airlines jet was evacuated when another Galaxy Note7 caught fire onboard - and it quickly emerged that the handset involved was a replacement unit from the stock that Samsung had declared safe to use. US mobile carriers moved quickly to offer all Note7 owners - including those whose devices have already been replaced - the opportunity to swap their handsets for a completely different phone. But in a more troubling development for Samsung, AT&T is reportedly considering terminating all sales of the Galaxy Note7 after this latest incident. This is, without a doubt, a seriously hot mess for the Korean tech giant. Lenovo will launch the Phab2 Pro, the world's first Project Tango phone, next month. The device will feature Google's depth-sensing 3D camera technology, offering interesting possibilities for the development of mixed reality applications. Meanwhile, Lenovo's chief operating officer said this week that it "doesn't have Windows phones or any plans to introduce a Windows phone". That certainly raised a few eyebrows, given that a Lenovo Windows 10 Mobile phone was unveiled in July, and is due to go on sale this month. It looks like Alcatel is preparing to launch a new Windows phone with a VR headset: the 'Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10', destined for T-Mobile in the US. Coship, one of the largest ODMs building Windows 10 Mobile handsets, spoke of uncertainty surrounding the platform this week. Citing the end of Microsoft's Lumia range, and the continued decline in global market share for Windows phones - now just 0.6%, according to Gartner - Coship said it's now wondering if it should continue investing in Windows phone development. Microsoft is offering its entry-level Lumia 550 in the US with $40 off its usual price of $139 - but you'll have to be quick, as that offer ends this weekend. The Lumia 650 launched on Cricket Wireless in the US in May for $129.99 with no annual contract, but the carrier has been dropping its prices steadily since then. After falling to $109.99, $69.99 and $49.99 over the last five months, Cricket is now giving the Lumia 650 away free to anyone who transfers their number to the carrier. Over in the UK, the price of Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships have been falling since before they even went on sale there. After originally being listed at £549.99 last year, the range-topping Lumia 950 XL is now available for just £299.99. Microsoft announced this week that all customer support and device repair services worldwide for its Lumia smartphones, as well as its feature phones, will now be handled by German company B2X. B2X said that it will release a "self-help app" for Windows phone owners later this month. The joke pretty much writes itself there, so let's move on. With the end in sight for its Lumia Windows phone range, it looks like Microsoft is now putting the final nail in the coffin of its Band wearable devices too. The company has pulled the Band 2 from its Store, and confirmed that there's no Band 3 coming this year. It seems very strange to end sales months before a successor is announced, leading many to speculate that Microsoft has no plans to ever release a Band 3. Microsoft is expected to unveil new devices at an event that it announced this week, to be held on October 26. The company is likely to show off its new Surface all-in-one desktop PC... ...along with a new Surface Mouse, Surface Keyboard, and Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. However, it looks like the first two of those peripherals are just rebranded versions of Microsoft's existing Designer Bluetooth Desktop, which it launched last year. Unfortunately, it looks like the wait for the much-rumored Surface Phone - which some fans consider to be a potential savior for Microsoft's mobile efforts - may be much longer than expected. A report from a reliable source this week indicated that the Surface Phone won't arrive until late 2017, or possibly even 2018. Microsoft revealed that it will be hosting its third Connect() developer event in New York City next month. After numerous users reported problems with installing Microsoft's latest cumulative update for Windows 10, build 14393.222, the company released a script to fix those issues a few days ago. Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14931 to the Slow ring on Wednesday - the first build from the Redstone 2 branch to make its way beyond the Fast ring. It published an updated list of known issues for that build on Thursday. Coinciding with that release, it also made ISOs available of build 14931 - the first ISOs to be offered since the Anniversary Update (build 14393) officially began rolling out in August. And on Friday, Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14942 made its way to PCs in the Fast ring, bringing a range of new features and improvements - but as always, there are some fixes and issues to be aware of before installing. And by the way, the Windows Insider Program celebrated its second birthday last weekend - an excellent excuse to eat cake. Microsoft is planning to make an important change to its Edge browser, delivering future updates via the Windows Store. eBay became the latest major brand to kill off its Windows phone app last weekend. So far, it doesn't look like the company is planning to launch a new Universal app for Windows 10 devices. And after rebranding its Lumia Help+Tips app to Lumia Highlights just four months ago, Microsoft ended support for the Windows phone app this week. Microsoft Paint has received a few improvements over the years, but its overall look and feature set hasn't changed all that much from the versions that shipped in Windows decades ago. That all looks set to change, as Microsoft is apparently preparing to launch a radical new version of Paint, with an astonishing array of new features and capabilities. Check out the video here to see it in action. Microsoft released its latest Groove Music update for Windows Insiders, bringing improvements to the user experience, along with several new features. A new Office Insider for Mac preview build was released on Tuesday, along with the latest Office Mobile Insider Preview for Windows 10 on Friday - both bringing new features to users. Microsoft also released Visual Studio '15' Preview 5, which includes some "key performance gains" for developers. And on Monday, Microsoft launched... a book. A Cloud for Global Good discusses the rise in connected services, and the need for societies and governments to deal with the worldwide digital revolution. For the first time since the operating system's launch last year, Windows 10 showed a slight decline in usage on the Steam gaming platform. The latest Xbox One Preview build arrived on Monday, bringing support for 'Arena for Xbox Live', the company's new online tournament platform. Three more Xbox 360 games were added to the list of those playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility program. Oculus announced a new standalone VR headset, slotting in between its PC-tethered option, the Rift; and its mobile option, the Gear VR, co-developed with Samsung. Oculus also announced that the minimum PC spec requirements for its Oculus Rift headset have been lowered, thanks to a little bit of software magic. Nvidia rolled out new 'Game Ready' drivers for its GeForce graphics cards, delivering optimizations for Gears of War 4 and Mafia 3, along with various other improvements. But our odyssey around the tech world ends this week in the fictional US city of Los Santos, San Andreas, where Samsung's hot Galaxy Note7 flag has been turned into an explosive weapon thanks to a new Grand Theft Auto V mod. Burn! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight some other great content from around the site, which I hope you’ll enjoy reading. First up, Chris Schroeder published his review of Gears of War 4 on the Xbox One. The latest game in the series certainly impressed him with its stunning visuals and enjoyable gameplay - but there's definitely room for improvement. Rich Woods shared his detailed review of the iPhone 7 Plus, and left no doubt that Apple's latest flagship phone is a truly remarkable beast. It scored very highly indeed, but there were a couple of negative aspects to the review - including, unsurprisingly, the absence of the headphone jack. Usama Jawad reviewed the Xiaomi Mi VR Play, an ultra-affordable solution for those seeking a smartphone VR experience on a modest budget. That's definitely worth a look! Ben Moore reviewed the AUKEY KM-G3, a mechanical keyboard for budget-conscious buyers. There's a lot to like about it, including solid build quality and keypresses, and some pleasing lighting effects, but it's certainly not perfect. Steven Johns put the Vernee Apollo Lite through its paces. With a ten-core chipset and 5.5-inch display, and a price tag of just $215, the handset has plenty of appeal on paper - but is it any good? Steven also had a chat with Ali Miracle, a visually-impaired software developer and FOSS activist from Baghdad, Iraq, discussing his life, and his thoughts on Free and Open Source Software. And finally, we're eager to hear your thoughts on Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, which it announced earlier this week. Check out what some of our other readers think, and have your say! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including loads of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

The Amazon Echo, which listens to you, answers questions and carries out tasks like calling an Uber or turning on your lights, is finding a place in millions of living rooms. The Dot and the portable Tap give the Echo's Alexa software even broader reach. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Photo by AP NEW YORK — Does your home really need a “smart speaker” that can answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits atop a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the gadget's main purpose was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Now, the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so that third-party developers can create new features for it, much the way Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent, a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That's growing fast, although it's still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They're early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. One key to the Echo's success was Amazon's willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen so-called “skills” and now has thousands.) “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored with their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the United States by Forrester Research's Technographics found 57 percent of them had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as lights or thermostats designed for remote control. The Echo's hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don't need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. “I've never used Cortana. I don't use Google and my wife doesn't use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop from Texas said. “I couldn't really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, an advertising executive in Portland, Ore., tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home, and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking basically did the trick, he said. Google has a lot of catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April, the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot electronic stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It's also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot — which it sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room — and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach.

According to recently released data, the top 5 of the destinations searched on Google is: Reykjavik - As Iceland is the ideal destination for adventure travel and Northern Lights spotting, trips to Reykjavik were preferred by women in their 20s and 30s. Havana - With the renewed diplomatic relationships between USA and Cuba this year and the first Florida-Havana commercial flight launched in August, people began to show their interest in the Caribbean island nation. According to Google report, men in their 30s and 40s were the ones searching for this destination. Toronto – Easy to access from eastern USA, Toronto was preferred by hockey fans and Americans living in Michigan. Canada's biggest city, Toronto is the capital of the province of Ontario located along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. Famous for its skyscrapers as well as for its wide green spaces, Toronto offers vibrant tourist attractions, appealing for the most selective of travelers. Mexico City - Mexico's capital is currently drawing enthusiastic travelers because of its powerful history, unique architecture and delicious cuisine. One of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City abounds in museums, archaeological sites and historical buildings. Food diversity can also be overwhelming. If willing to discover the true spirit of a Mexican fiesta, than this is the perfect place for you! Tokyo – Since the country has just raised its tourism goals for the next 4 years, the tech-friendly Tokyo will probably not be the only destination in Japan that will appeal to travelers. For now, Google's data indicated that people searching for this destination are predominantly men, aged between 24-35. If you still can’t decide which new places to visit on your next holiday, Google Destinations can help you choose between amazing adventurous places, as well as the ideal peaceful destinations for the entire family.

Tech giants are hungry for artificial intelligence. In a race to create the best AI solutions in an increasingly hot sector, U.S. tech behemoths like Alphabet's Google and iPhone maker Apple have been quietly snapping up dozens of artificial intelligence companies over the last five years, according to a recent report from analysis firm CB Insights. The firm's data sheds new light on a trend that's been evolving for years. Nearly 140 private companies working to advance AI technology have been acquired since 2011, including 40 buyouts just this year, CB noted. From Google's Assistant to Apple's Siri; Microsoft's Cortana to Facebook chatbots, tech companies appear to be locked in a fierce competition to create autonomous technology that can understand users' needs, and provide information quickly and reliably, CB Insights noted. In addition, companies like AOL, IBM and Yahoo were also among the acquirers, CB said. The report comes as Silicon Valley makes increasingly aggressive inroads into AI, and last week, Microsoft created an artificial intelligence unit of its own. It's a hot market that research firm Tractica estimates will balloon from $643.7 million in 2016 revenues to $38.8 billion by 2025. show chapters <p>Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google</p> <p>The purchase will help the tech firm compete with Siri and Alexa in the world of artificial intelligence.</p> Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:50 Google has been the most prominent global player, CB noted, with 11 low-key acquisitions in the category. Most recently, the tech giant picked up Api.ai, a platfom used to develop chatbots. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company objective was to give each individual user their own Google. And last week, Google unveiled a high-end smartphone, Pixel, and home device installed with its AI software. Google said it believes that the next opportunity is building hardware and software together for better AI. The strategic move pitted the company against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Corporate giants following closely in purchasing AI companies include Intel and Apple. Apple, which is usually quite about its acquisitions and planning, acquired Turi and Tuplejump recently, according to CB Insights. Earlier this year, Apple acquired an start-up called Emotient which has developed technology that can detect emotions. Not to be outdone, Samsung snapped up startup Viv Labs, amid a growing controversy over reports that its premium Galaxy Note 7 battery was exploding.

Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming introduction and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Direct competition Google’s introduction of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who spoke on anonymity. Verizon investment Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 introduction through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.Creative ads But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said noting the white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

I can’t imagine the number of times his preschool teachers’ eyes rolled when he talked about Google as if she was a close friend of his who answers all his questions and plays his favorite music. But without getting ahead of ourselves, you’ll see hear the boy turn on the living room lights at first, then launch into a series of “Okay Googeeelll” questions with the super precise enunciation that you expect of a 4-year-old (read: nah).

You probably haven't heard a whole lot about the location-based photo service in the past few years, and that's because this is actually the second time that Google's tried to close down the platform, after ultimately relenting following a user petition in 2014. Now, this time the company really means it and no amount of protest is going to stop the service closing. That means you'll need to make sure your account is linked to your Google+ account if you the photos you've uploaded over the years copued across to a Google archive for downloading. "If you have linked your Panoramio profile with a Google account, all your Panoramio photos will be copied to the Google Album Archive at full resolution after Panoramio goes away. These copied photos will not use any of your Google storage quota. Your Panoramio photos that appear in Google Maps will continue to appear in Maps, unless you delete them later from the Maps Contributions panel," Google advises users. From Google's perspective, it makes a lot of sense as it has newer features attached to Google Maps that do a similar, if not the same, job. Specifically, the Local Guides option, which lets people upload photos, reviews and other information about a location. From the perspective of long-time users that spent years contributing to Panoramio, uploading images, levelling up their accounts and generally building a community, it feels more like a metaphorical kick in the teeth. While there's a substitute in the form of Local Guides, and Panoramio had a good run since its launch in 2005, it's unlikely that the platform's holdouts will make the jump to Google Maps due to a slightly different feature set and less of a community focus.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Polar M600 review: Top-notch smartwatch and fitness tracker fusion Chris Hall8 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended £269 For Solid design, sports takes priority over smartwatch, all of Android Wear's functions, Polar Flow does so much, respectable battery performance for a smartwatch, IPX8 waterproofing Against Design could be more exciting, swimming could be better served, heart rate can be a little erratic, price Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The explosion of smartwatches and fitness trackers has thrown up some real gems and thrown down some real turds, leaving us all to step carefully when choosing a new device. Polar is an established name in fitness devices, one of the oldest, perhaps, when dealing with heart rate monitoring. A widening portfolio from Polar has seen the birth of more lifestyle devices in the A family and stepping up in functions across the M (sport) and V (pro) devices, with a gradual increase in wider connectivity across the brand's offerings. The M600 is a rethinking, adopting a proper smartwatch platform and offering those fitness tracker functions the company is known for combined with a lot more on the watch side than you'd normally get. The result is one of the most considered sports devices we've seen and certainly one of the best Android Wear devices to date. Pocket-lint Polar M600 review: Design and build The Polar M600 mates the body module with a rubber strap and, like the TomTom Spark, the body slots into the strap meaning the two sections can be easily separated when you want to clean them. The design looks a lot like previous Polar watches, although it's pretty thick, meaning you need enough wrist for it to sit on. If you're of the thin forearm variety you might think it's too big, but we found it sat well on an average male arm. The chunkiness gives it some substance and it looks good, both from a sports point of view and as a smartwatch. Compared to other Android Wear devices, Polar's watch-making experience is apparent, as this is much nicer than something like the Moto 360 Sport and looks better and wears better than that previous attempt. As with other Polar devices the screen is square fitting Polar's family design. Pocket-lint On to the more serious stuff. There's proper waterproofing with an IPX8 rating so it supports swimming, the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass to avoid scratches and the metal detailing that frames the display left and right gives a premium look. There's the choice of black or white, although we'd like to see a choice of strap colours to give the design wider appeal. The rubber strap is easy to adjust and uses a conventional two pronged buckle, with two bands to stop the spare strap catching on things. Most importantly, the M600 is comfortable to wear and sweat through, and weighing 65g, it's not too heavy either. Polar M600 review: Sports features first Designed as a sports watch first, there are two buttons. The first button to the left side is the standard Android Wear button, letting you go home, wake the display or long press to access the menu. The second button on the front takes you straight to the sports side, opening the Polar app. This is very much sports territory and we really like that Polar hasn't been distracted by Android Wear: it's taken the platform and owned it, rather than skipping around Google's fancy smartwatch features. Pocket-lint The hardware tells a similar story. With an optical heart rate sensor onboard and its own GPS you're ready to run out the door and leave your smartphone at home. There is no compass or barometer, however, so direction and elevation is based on GPS. There's also support for accessories, so if you have an H7 Polar chest strap, you'll get the option of using that, which might be the preferred option for cyclists. One of the skills that Polar does adopt from Android Wear is the support for Bluetooth headphones and local storage for your music, meaning you can take your music with you on the run, again without your phone. TomTom Spark 3 offers this, as does Apple Watch 2, and it's a feature that is sure to be popular. The great thing is that this full feature set, supported by this hardware, makes for a great fitness device, before you even touch the smartwatch side of things.  Polar M600 review: Hardware specs and display The Polar M600 is powered by a MediaTek chipset with 512MB RAM and a standard 4GB of storage. The battery is 500mAh which is pretty good for this type of device and explains the thickness. Pocket-lint There's a 1.3-inch display on the front with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. This isn't the largest or sharpest Android Wear watch display, but as we said, the screen fits and we found it a good size for reading on the move. It supports always on functions, dimming in normal wear and brightening up when you move the watch to look at. As an LCD this is a backlit full colour display so it's illuminated, rather than using the lower power displays that some other sports watches offer. It looks great, which adds to the appeal, but does draw more heavily on the battery than the mono TomTom or Garmin displays, for example. It does have an ambient light sensor, however, so adjusts to the lighting conditions around you. Polar M600 review: Battery life and charging The 500mAh battery will give you about 2 days of use when connected to an Android device, including exercise time. You might be able to push it to a little more in casual wear. We've not tested the Polar M600 with an iPhone, but reports suggest this drops to about a day with Apple's phone. In reality, the Android Wear experience is much enhanced when paired with an Android phone and at least you have the option, unlike the Apple Watch. Pocket-lint Two days is good for Android Wear devices, but it does mean regular charging compared to many other sports watches which will often give you perhaps 5 active days or more - but without really offering any smart functions. That's the trade-off here: the Polar M600 doesn't have great endurance in sporting terms, but it offers a whole lot more in terms of functionality, meaning it does a lot more than just tell you the time when you're walking around.  Charging is via the magnetic connection point on the rear and over the past weeks that we've been using the M600, we've typically opted to charge every other day without it running flat. The charger neatly attaches to the rear of the watch without needing to clip anything on or fiddle around. Polar M600 review: Setup and connections To get the M600 up and running you need two things: the Android Wear app and the Polar Flow app on your phone. The first handles the connection to your phone, the second syncs with your Polar account and syncs the data from your watch. Using Android Wear on an Android smartphone makes for a fast and easy connection as the devices are designed for seamless cooperation. Once you're connected, you can use the Android Wear app to control many of the smartwatch functions, like deciding what notifications you want from your M600 and so on. Pocket-lint The Android Wear app will also then sync your apps, so anything you have on your device that's compatible with Wear will then move over - like Spotify, Play Music, Citymapper and even other fitness apps if you want to use them.  The Polar Flow app then handles everything else. This is where you'll view your stats and be able to get a good look at your activities you record using the M600. We like the Polar Flow app. It's very much a lifestyle app on your phone, firstly delivering a report on your daily activities, but it lets you dive into your runs, check out your heart rate and pace from an activity as well as your route and other essential details.  Taking things further, the Polar Flow app has a calendar in it too where you can schedule workouts, meaning you can tap the watch and dive into the workout that you've planned. If you're training against a plan, it means you've got the information on your wrist, ready to get going. You can setup intervals, distance or time targets. You can also sync Polar training results and targets into your Google Calendar if you want and share the data with a couple of other services - Strava and Training Peaks. Pocket-lint Information is synced from the app to the web version of Polar Flow which includes a few more options and has more in-depth information. However, you don't have to use the browser at all during setup: you can connect the Polar M600 to your phone and do everything there, without having to use a PC. There are a couple of bespoke Polar watch faces that will show you daily activity, so you can see where you are with your target at a glance, which help boost the fitness tracker side of the M600. Polar M600 review: 24/7 activity monitoring Before we get to actual sports tracking, the M600 wants to monitor what you're doing all the time. We mentioned that the Polar Flow has a lifestyle approach and this is has, breaking down your day into sleep, resting, sitting, low, medium or high activity. With this in mind, you're presented with your progress through your day on the watch face. One of the elements of this is steps, which we feel is a little too enthusiastic about awarding you a "step". It's a hard thing to measure, as when we measured physical steps, the results seemed accurate enough, but in an average day in the office, we seemed to accrue many more steps through other movements. Compared to Fitbit tracking, for example, it's a lot easier to hit your step target with the M600, suggesting that it's a lot more sensitive to movement than it perhaps should be. Steps isn't really an absolute measure, however, so if it's steps you're interested in, this probably isn't the device for you. If you're inactive for too long you'll get inactivity alerts and these aren't just reminders to move, they get logged in Polar Flow, so you'll feel the enduring shame. If that's not a motivator, we don't know what is. One of the nice aspects of Polar Flow is that it reports on your day, week and month assessing your activity and telling you what difference that has made to your life. Polar M600 review: Running and sports functions Press that button on the front and the Polar app opens on the M600. There are two sections, one to check your daily activity in more detail and the second to start recording a sport. Polar gives you freedom to choose your sport profiles to suit the activities. For many this will be running, cycling or swimming, but there's a full range of sports to choose from, like badminton, dance, football or plain old walking, for example. That's great, because you don't have to compromise on categorising your activity. Want to record your dog walking? No problem. Want to record your Friday rowing session? No problem. Pocket-lint For outdoor sports you have GPS tracking, so there are different profiles for pool and open water swimming for example, which we really like and you only have to have the sports on your watch that you actually need. Don't want "other outdoor"? You can remove it. Head into the Polar Flow website and you get to customise your sports profiles further, changing the information you see on your watch, which it really clever. Once you've selected your activity, the watch sensors fire up, looking for GPS and turning on the optical heart rate sensor on the rear. You can start the activity immediately, or wait for those things sensors to lock on, but again, with time being precious, it's sometimes good to get going without having to wait. We've found the GPS to lock on quickly, however, so there's never really been too much of a delay in getting started.  During your sport, you're presented with a number of screens with relevant information, based on the activity you're doing. For running you get a main screen that's similar to Polar's other devices, like the V800. The M600 has the advantage of colour, so as you move through different heart rate zones, the colour of the HR readout will change too, for at-a-glance information. There's also clear indiction of pace and distance when running. Swimming isn't as well served as it could be, with pool swimming lacking the option to detect lengths automatically like the Apple Watch 2 does. That leaves you with heart rate tracking and time, which is good enough. We also found that the flow of the water was able to swipe through screens, so we'd often stop a set in the pool with something different on the display. Pocket-lint With Android Wear automatically dimming the display, Polar has added the option to have the display always on. This means you can glance and see the stats without having to touch and avoids the problem of not being able to view the screen without an over exaggerated gesture. That will eat more battery, but if you're busting a gut trying to beat your 10k PB run, you won't care, you'll just need to keep an easy eye on your pace. If there was one thing we'd want to boost the watch's sporting credentials, it's another button. We'd love a start/stop button, rather than having to use the display, but that's a minor thing. There's also no automatic detection for your activities, but sitting closer to a serious running watch we think that's fine: it will differentiate between activity levels in the daily tracking anyway, so there's no harm in selecting the sport you're doing for detailed tracking. One of the great things is that the Polar Flow website provides a lot more information than you'll find on other platforms. It will give you an overview of your running progress, it will estimate how much fatigue you might be carrying over from earlier workouts as a guide to whether you're over or under training. You can also sign-up to training programmes, meaning there's a lot on offer, beyond your actual running stats. Polar M600 review: GPS and heart rate performance There's a wide degree of variation in performance with the latest crop of sports gadgets, something that's seen widespread reporting about accuracy. The Polar M600 performs well in tracking via GPS, with some really accurate route tracking and good distance recording. Polar has put six LEDs in the optical heart rate sensor on the back of the M600, aiming to ensure it's as accurate as it can be. Naturally, using the optional chest strap will give better results, but wrist measurement is all about convenience. The M600 performs fairly well, but we have seen some inconsistent HR results at times. Pocket-lint We've seen a fairly slow start at times, with the first 10 minutes or so seeing a slow build-up of heart rate, not quite reflecting the real rate increase. We've also had some runs where the watch would occasionally show a blank result, as though it wasn't recording, but it was. On checking the results afterwards, there's no sign of drop-out.  To verify what was happening, we tested it against a Garmin Forerunner 610 with chest strap. The Garmin was faster to respond to rate changes, more accurately reflecting the build-up of heart rate at the start of the run, as well as responding faster to some sprint sections we threw in. However, at the end of the run, both showed an average of 152bpm and both showed the same distance covered and same average pace. So, although there are some anomalies with the results, that overall doesn't have a huge impact on the bigger picture of runs when using the Polar M600. Outside of running we've found it to deliver some good results and we're impressed it manages to offer a consistent result when swimming, for example.  Polar M600 review: A full Android Wear experience That's where most sports devices would reach the limit of their functionality, but sitting on the Android Wear platform, the Polar M600 offers a whole lot more. You get a full range of alerts and notifications and if you have an Android smartphone, this really is a first class offering, especially compared to the arrangement on some other sports devices. It's something that's offered by other Polar watches and some Garmin devices, but here you're supported by the Android community for your functionality, not just Polar. Pocket-lint We've mentioned apps and one of the aspects that the M600 gets from Android Wear is Bluetooth headphone and music support. You can connect any Bluetooth headphones you like, but music support is limited to Google's Play Music service and you have to download and sync that from your phone, which is a bit of a faff so it's worth only syncing music for running, but we love not having to carry that vintage iPod on the run.  Expanding out into other Android Wear highlights, you have Google Maps for navigation while you're connected to your phone, support for Ok Google voice controls, so you can speak replies to messages and so on. Then you have all the fun stuff, like being able to pause your Spotify music from your watch, controlling Netflix over your Chromecast, or getting Citymapper directions right on your wrist.  Although Android Wear has a bad rep from lacklustre early devices, the Polar M600 isn't one of them. This is a sports watch that benefits from a huge range of extra functions enabled by Android Wear, resulting in something fun and functional. In many ways, the Polar M600 is currently without compare. Verdict The Polar M600 is a fusion of smartwatch and sports device. It takes Android's platform and laces in sports and fitness tracking functions, but maintains a balance that some devices don't manage. It succeeds in being both where others have failed. It feels like a proper Polar sports watch, boosted by the best of Android Wear. For an Android smartphone user, this is a device that's worth serious consideration. If you've been put off by Android Wear so far, this is how to do Android Wear right. It's not about bland presentation, it's about underpinning something more exciting. In this case, it's a fully-featured activity watch, especially good for running, that barely feels like Android Wear at all. The Polar M600 is currently rather unique. It's not only an effective sports partner, it's a great smartwatch too.

Store bosses were able to identify the 30-year-old from the Google Street View stills. Although, as per Google policy, her face was blurred they were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing.  She wore the same outfit when she was arrested. 'I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange,' said Peter Darby, an IT worker who came across the images.  'I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. Run! Store Bosses were able to identify her from her distinctive white top she was wearing for the robbery and when she was arrested. And she thought she got away with it. McIvor flees the store as caught on Google Street View with a worker in tow  'You could tell as soon as you looked at the pictures that something was up as she came out of there very angrily. 'She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.'  The images were filmed on June 19 in the town center at around 2.45pm.

The women, who has been a heroin addict since 16, also took drugs in prison and used someone else's name to get out of trouble.

Everything you need to know about Google's new Wi-Fi router The Daily Dot 10/8/2016 Amrita Khalid © Photo via Google Google Wifi If your Wi-Fi signal is slow or patchy in some areas of the house, Google may soon solve that problem.  Google previewed a slate of new products this week that includes Google Wi-Fi, a set of Wi-Fi points designed to be placed throughout your house. The concept is known as "mesh Wi-Fi." It uses multiple Wi-Fi points instead of the centralized router systems most of us are accustomed to. Google Wi-Fi points are expandable—you can buy as many as you need—and are designed to connect to each other.  Interestingly enough, Google only just released a Wi-Fi router last year, Google OnHub. According to Ars Technica, if you own a Google OnHub already, you don't need to pick one over the other. A Google OnHub router can be used as a node in your Google Wi-Fi network. © Provided by Daily Dot If you're a heavy gamer, love streaming video, or live in a house with people that fit those categories, mesh Wi-Fi is certainly an attractive prospect. Parents will no doubt love that Google Wi-Fi's app allows you to shut off the Wi-Fi during homework time or whenever else you choose.  But there are a couple of reasons that Google Wi-Fi may give you pause. Mesh networks have gotten a bad wrap in recent years for still being slow, spotty, and expensive. Mesh networks have traditionally been used in emergency and disaster scenarios.  Mesh networks are cheap to set up and require no centralized network for set-up. According to Wired, the only way to shut down a mesh network is to shut individually shut down every node in the network. Recent advancements in mesh technology have been faster and more consistent, but the jury's still out on how fast Google Wi-Fi will be when compared to a centralized Wi-Fi network.  Google Wi-Fi is priced at $129 for a single pack and $299 for a three-pack. It's being released in November. A single access point should cover a 1,500 square-foot home.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More Internet rallies behind genteel old man after death of beloved pet hamster The Daily Dot Hackers just infiltrated the Google Pixel phone in less than 60 seconds The Daily Dot These adorable 4-year-olds did the Mannequin Challenge, and it might be the best one ever The Daily Dot 'Silicon Valley' star Kumail Nanjiani tweets about Trump supporters harassing him The Daily Dot The Daily Dot View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, the search engine’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, in a statement on Saturday said that the application would be available on Google Play and the App Store. “Like most Nigerian parents, you love helping your kids learn new things about the world. For instance, you spend a lot of time with them on YouTube, watching videos that interest them. “You skip videos not meant for their age, just to explore the sing along songs on HooplaKidz, Sesame Street, history and science channels. The fun is catching, but your alertness is important! “With the newly introduced YouTube Kids App now available for download in Nigeria, your kids can enjoy more videos on every topic in the world; protected from adult-type content, while you do other things,” Kola-Ogunlade said. The Google manager said that the app, which had parental controls, would help the parent to control the kid’s experience, without meddling in their fun. “A parent can determine how much exploring their kids can do, by turning on the search or limit the child’s experience by turning it off. “The timer feature on YouTube Kids alerts your kids when time is up, by limiting screen time. “The sound settings allow you to turn off the sounds, so you can catch your breath while your kid watches in peace,” he said. According to him, the YouTube Kids App comes with a Pass Code, as there is ”no sneaking around watching when I am not there” and a logged-out experience. “The logged out experience enables one to enjoy the fun, no sign-in hassles, features like uploading, sharing, liking etc, linked to accounts have been removed,” Kola-Ogunlade said.

Does Google's new Pixel phone make it time to try Project Fi too? 0 Share: Mobile by Marguerite Reardon October 8, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @maggie_reardon Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Google has added its new flagship phone, the Pixel, to the device lineup for its Project Fi wireless service. But is Project Fi right for you? Google on Tuesday announced the Pixel and Pixel XL, two high-end smartphones meant to go up against Samsung's Galaxy devices and Apple's iPhones. It's Google's first attempt to market a smartphone to the masses. Along with getting your hands on the device through Verizon, you can also use the Pixel on Project Fi, the experimental wireless network Google launched in 2015. Up to now, the service worked only with three of Google's Nexus branded smartphones: the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I'll offer some more details on Project Fi and help one reader, curious about Google's new Pixel, decide whether to give Project Fi a chance too. Dear Maggie, I'm intrigued by Google's new Pixel phone. I read it will be available on Google's wireless network, Project Fi. I'm not really sure what Project Fi is all about. Is it a service I should consider? Or should I stick with Verizon or some other major carrier? Thanks, Curious About Google Dear Curious, The beauty of the Pixel is that it gives you lots of options. Even though the Pixel is being marketed as an exclusive to Verizon, the truth is that it's also sold through Google as an unlocked phone and can be used on any wireless network in the US, including Google's own Project Fi. Pixel Phone by GooglePhoto by James Martin/CNET The first question you need to ask yourself is whether you can even access Project Fi. Once you've figured that out, you can start comparing it to services from other carriers. Refresher on Project Fi Let's start with the basics. Google's Project Fi is a service that uses a combination of cellular coverage from Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular as well as local Wi-Fi networks. This means you need to make sure you live and work in an area where at least one of these carriers offers strong coverage. A key aspect of Project Fi's service is technology that determines which network offers the best connection, allowing it to seamlessly switch among these networks if one connection weakens, so having access to two or to all three of these networks is even better. The biggest benefit of Project Fi's Wi-Fi-first approach is that it can access more than a million Wi-Fi hotspots to provide inexpensive wireless internet connectivity. The idea is that if you can use less-expensive Wi-Fi infrastructure more often than a cellular network, you can keep service costs low. Plans start at $20 for unlimited talk, text messaging and access to Wi-Fi based data. The price increases by $10 for each gigabyte of data service you use on one of the three cellular networks Project Fi accesses when Wi-Fi isn't available. So if you want 1GB of data per month to use while roaming on a cellular data network, that will cost you $30 a month. With 2GB of data, you'll spend $40 a month, and so on. 7 Up close with Google's power-packed Pixel XL The pricing is pretty straightforward, but if you're using a lot of cellular data, those charges can add up quickly. For about the same price as that 4GB or 5GB of data on Project Fi, you can get unlimited talk, text and data on Sprint and T-Mobile. Some prepaid offers are also comparable in price. Wi-Fi-first competitor Republic Wireless, which will also support the Pixel, is one such option that's cheaper than Project Fi. Its basic service with unlimited talk, text and Wi-Fi data starts at $15 a month. It also offers a better deal for customers who need more data for cellular roaming. Its service, which works with either Sprint or T-Mobile, costs $45 a month for 4GB of cellular data, while Project Fi charges $60 for 4GB of cellular roaming. Still, Project Fi has its benefits. Because Project Fi doesn't charge hefty roaming fees for data service when you're abroad, it's a particularly attractive plan for international travelers. The service is available in more than 135 different countries. Phone calls while abroad if you're not using a Wi-Fi hotspot are 20 cents per minute and text messaging is free regardless of whether you're on Wi-Fi or roaming onto a local cellular carrier. The bottom line Project Fi is great for people who don't use much cellular data, because they're either light data users or they have access to Wi-Fi most of the time. It's also a great service for folks who travel abroad frequently. If this isn't you, you may want to consider prepaid or unlimited plans from carriers like T-Mobile and Sprint or other Wi-Fi-first operators, like Republic Wireless, which can offer you a better deal. The good news is that the Pixel can be used on just about any US carrier, so you can give Project Fi a chance and if you don't like it, you can switch to another carrier.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Johana Bhuiyan. Updated October 8, 2016 6:36AM SHARE ALSO SEE Automotive Google Uber Lyft Driverless Ford Fusion Self-Driving Car Autonomous Google -- which has been working on its self-driving cars since 2009 -- is not in the car-making business. Nope, Google is in the superhuman-driver-making business, according to Dmitri Dolgov, the company's head of self-driving technology. Driving is a social activity, Dolgov told Recode during a live walkthrough of the technology on Google's self-driving car. That means that the car has to not only be able to detect and recognize humans and other objects, it also has to be able to interact with, understand and react to their behavior. To that end, the company's self-driving software has developed to be able to detect and understand things like hand signals -- a uniform method of symbolic communication that pedestrians and human drivers often use on the road -- and react appropriately. So, when a bicyclist, for example, signals left using his or her hand, the car will react as a (generous) human might. For Google, developing an ideal driver also means creating a suite of sensors and software that can be used to drive everywhere, no matter the make or model of the vehicle. "It doesn't matter," Dolgov said. "We're building a driver. We've been on Prius, Lexus; we have our own prototype, and we're now working with Fiat Chryslers on a new platform. "As far as the software is concerned, it's the same thing," he continued. "It's like you getting into another car. You get a rental - maybe it's a little bit bigger, and it doesn't quite handle the same way as your own car - it takes you time to get used to, but the core tasks transfer." Unlike a human driver, however, Google's cars use a combination of maps and long-range laser and regular radars that enable the car to see at least 100 meters around it, while also knowing what turns, traffic lights and roads to expect well before it detects them. The cars also communicate with each other via the cloud. While humans can't automatically download driving experience from a more experienced driver, robot cars learn new skills as soon as one car learns it. That, of course, opens up the risk of hacking - a risk Google took into account from the inception of the project. Dolgov described how, to prevent hackers from being able to access all of the cars connected to each other, Google engineers separate the interface that cars use to communicate from the one that is used to control the car. "We limit the amount of information that can be shared, and how that affects other cars," Dolgov said. "If you have complete control of one vehicle, maybe you can create a construction zone that doesn't actually exist in the world, but that's the extent of it. There's no way to control the local driving behavior." © 2016 Re/Code syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsGoogle Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google Didn’t Hold Back on the iPhone 7’s Camera Performance (GOOG) Google-parent Alphabet Inc. says its flagship smartphone has the best camera ever made. October 8, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its newest flagship smartphone, the Pixel alongside Pixel XL, and boy, did the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made some bold claims. According to Google exec Sundar Pichai, the Pixel has the single best phone camera ever made. And to erase all doubts that Google is coming after the iPhone 7, the event was filled with savage burns directed at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is all about camera performance and it’s been one of the key features that’s consistently improving with every reiteration of the iPhone. To illustrate how deeply Apple cares about camera performance, execs say that over 800 engineers worked on the iPhone 7’s camera, piecing together over 200 components within the teeny tiny camera modules. And because of the improved hardware, the iPhone 7 featured a bump that most users are unhappy about. Google execs made not-so-subtle digs at the iPhone 7 camera bump during the launch. In a live demo, the bump has been mentioned one time too many, highlighting the fact that the Pixel does not have this much-maligned design. The execs added that Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC assembled the Pixel smartphones. Google also bragged about the Pixel’s camera performance, highlighting the fact that its newest smartphone scored 89 out of 100 in a DxOMark Mobile test. On the same test, the iPhone 7 scored an 86. DxOMark is known for rating cameras and lenses for smartphones and high-end DSLRs alike using sophisticated analysis software. However, it’s worth noting that DxOMark has yet to review iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. Google also slammed one of most common sources of frustration among iPhone users, the limited storage. As you know, photos and videos eat a lot of space and if you’re using an iOS device, then you might be familiar with the annoying storage full popups. According to Brian Rakowski, Google’s vice president of product management, Pixel and the Pixel XL users can kiss these “painful” Storage Full popups goodbuy because their flagship smartphones will come with “free unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.” Moreover, both the regular and the XL Pixels share the same features, which means, Google is not putting a premium on extra/special features, something that’s been a tradition at Apple. To top it all off, the Pixel smartphones will be the first to feature Google’s newest digital assistant, the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri. Other notable Pixel camera features include the ability to edit photos. Google’s Pixel smartphone features a sleek, aluminum and glass form factor. The smaller, 5 inch model – priced at $649 – comes with a storage of 32 GB, while the larger XL, features a 5.5-inch screen with up to 128 GB storage, just like the iPhone 7 Plus.

It seems unlikely, and here's why. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Google.  Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Google could probably do it Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). One major hurdle that Google would undoubtedly face in trying to build its own custom chip is the fact that it could not easily license a cellular modem to integrate into such a chip. Google would either have to spend a lot of time, money, and effort to even hope to build a reasonably competitive cellular modem or it would need to use stand-alone modems from the likes of Qualcomm or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the two suppliers of modems into the latest iPhone.  The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using.  In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. Would it be worthwhile? The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. If Google were a major smartphone vendor and its core revenue/profitability depended on selling large volumes of ultra-premium smartphones, then there might be a case to spend all of the time and effort to build in-house applications processors, though there's no guarantee that it'd be as good as, let alone better than, what Google could buy from Qualcomm. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. I'm not betting on it My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul.

Farhad: Hello, Mike! How’s it going? I’m preparing for a trip to Hong Kong and Singapore to talk to some people about the growing divide between Asian and American tech companies. But now that I think about it, maybe I should just pull a Fox News and visit New York’s Chinatown instead. What do you think? Mike: I’m going to go with, uh, no on that one. Unless you want the whole internet to come down on you like they did that reporter. Also, man, I need to get some Southeast Asian writing gigs. Can you at least bring me back a souvenir? Farhad: No, I can’t. Anyway, let’s talk tech. So remember how Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 phones were exploding because of a battery flaw, and after a whole lot of foot-dragging, the company recalled and replaced them? Well, you’ll never guess what happened. The replacement phones may be exploding, too. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That’s according to The Verge, which reported that a Southwest Airlines flight had to be evacuated this week because a Note 7 started spewing a “thick grey-green angry smoke.” The phone’s owner told The Verge that the model had been declared safe by Samsung. The company says it is investigating the incident. Oh, also, Samsung’s washing machines might explode. Let me put on my tech pundit hat and spin some commentary on this issue: This seems bad. Like, really bad. If your products start exploding, you’re in trouble. Mike: If I were a public relations guy over there, I’d try to spin this as a marketing tactic. “Our new phones are so hot, hot, hot that they will literally blow you away!” That, or Samsung should make a large investment in a fireproof pants start-up. Farhad: There was also news about Twitter this week. Well, kind of. What we really saw was a lot of smoke — rumor after rumor that several companies were in hot pursuit of the troubled social network. Twitter’s stock price shot up on the possibility that Salesforce, Google and Disney would engage in a fierce bidding war to acquire and remake it. Mike: A lot of short-sellers had to do some quick juggling. I will play the world’s tiniest violin for ruining their weekends. Farhad: But then the whole thing fizzled. Recode reported that Google and Disney weren’t interested. At a developer conference in San Francisco, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, seemed to throw cold water on the idea of buying Twitter. On Thursday, Twitter’s stock price plunged.

Privacy Policy So what’s the deal? Is anyone interested in buying this service? And if not, what happens next? Mike: We’re working on that. I will stand mute for now, but more to come. Farhad: O.K., a few other things. A couple of weeks ago, we were talking about how Yahoo suffered an enormous security breach that compromised the accounts of 500 million people. This week we learned of another black eye for the company — apparently the Justice Department obtained a warrant that forced Yahoo to scan incoming email for a digital signature tied to a terrorist organization. It’s a terrible string of bad news for a company that was already on the ropes; now, according to The New York Post, Verizon is seeking to renegotiate the $4.8 billion sales price it recently agreed to for Yahoo. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I mean, that makes sense, right? Mike: For my money, there is no bargaining chip better than “your security is Swiss cheese and you compromised the digital safety of more than half a billion people” to sweeten the terms of an acquisition. What a flaming garbage fire of a situation. That said, at least Yahoo email accounts are not literally exploding on Southwest Airlines flights. Just figuratively, I guess. Farhad: Finally, Google. The search company unveiled a grab bag of new stuff this week, signaling a new interest in building hardware — an on-again, off-again effort for Google. The company’s new phone, the Pixel, is intended to show off all of Google’s artificial intelligence smarts, including the talking assistant creatively named … the Google Assistant. Also, the company put out some more details about Home, its coming competitor to Amazon’s Echo home assistant. I haven’t gotten to use either of these things yet, but I have to say, I’m kind of excited about them. Are you? Mike: I’ll tamp down my expectations for the moment, considering that first-generation products are usually terrible. Also, I happen to be one of the people who scoffed at the Amazon Echo when it came out. A few hundred bucks for what essentially amounted to a neat dinner party trick — “Alexa, play some Blink 182 for us.” — was not something I could afford. I was probably looking at it wrong. If you believe in the kind of future envisioned by Google, Amazon and Apple, search and interaction will probably be governed by a persistent, semi-omniscient entity that sits inside our living rooms. That’s the locus of our home lives right now, where we convene with the family after work or school. Where we watch TV or listen to music or, dare I say it, read a book on the couch. These companies are focused on that one place where speaking out loud to an assistant makes the most immediate sense. Advertisement Continue reading the main story I hardly see these assistants staying confined to the living room. Eventually, after getting used to the creature scheduling comforts that Alexa and Assistant afford us, these persistent bots will be put into more common use outside of the living room: the kitchen, the shower, the garage, even our cars. It’s already happening in fits and starts on our mobile devices. I imagine it will go far beyond even that. Think of it as HAL 9000, but with significantly less murder involved. I mean, at least I hope so. Farhad: Huh. Dark, but hopeful. Mike: That’s an apt description of my general worldview, Farhad. Farhad: I’ve already told you many times before: I’m not your therapist. Till next week! Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

We have compiled a list of beautiful looking, productivity yielding Calendar apps for Android users.  ( Tapir Apps | Google Store ) Advertisement Facebook recently launched its Events App for iOS, and users can plan their attendance to nearby events and sync with their friends to enjoy some quality time together. Events App also features a neat integration with Apple's proprietary Calendar app, making it easy to keep track of the conferences, concerts, and parties that users might want to attend. However, Facebook Events is only available on iOS at the moment, so users of Google's mobile OS might miss out. That is why we listed some of the best calendar apps for Android users. aCalendar (Free or $4.99 for full features) Ranking first on many reviewers' lists of calendars, aCalendar surely deserves its place at the top. The app features a solid assortment of features, such as many types of views, multiple widgets and more. To those who can get by with basic tools, it comes at zero additional cost. Productivity oriented users might want to fork out $4.99 for the full version, which comes with more control features and gesture controls. Users who downloaded aCalendar from Google Store gave it a 4.4/5, which is the highest mark on our list. CloudCal ($2.50 for full features) Android users get one of the most intuitive and easy-on-the-eyes ways of showing how busy they are on any given day. ClouldCal uses a system dubbed Magic Circles, which depicts days as clock faces, with each activity corresponding to a circle (or slice) of a different color. The app features a neat integration of customizable views, calendar import and gesture support, and it plays nice with apps such as Google Maps, Uber, and Waze. Keep in mind that in order to use the transportation apps you need to shell out $2.50 for the Pro version. Download CloudCal from Google Store, where it scores 4.3/5. Google Calendar (Free) Google's proprietary Calendar app delivers a clean, bright interface and a multitude of views: traditional month and week views alongside schedule-focused views. Integration with your Gmail account lets you automatically sap information about flights, hotel accommodation, and restaurant reservations from your emails and create events based on said info. You may also use it for reminders and to-do lists. Users may download Google Calendar from Google Store, where it ranks 4.1/5. DigiCal (Free) DigiCal is a versatile Android calendar that offers a myriad of view modes and widgets. Users can have an overview or a detailed breakdown of their schedule, thanks to the day, week, month or year-based view mode. The app plays nice with Exchange, Outlook and Google Calendar. What is more, DigiCal lets you know when to pack an umbrella thanks to its embedded weather forecast, and its invitation management and time zone features are quite useful, as well. Get DigiCal from Google Store, where it sits at 4.3/5. TAG Calendar app, Facebook Events App, Android Apps, Calendar, Google Calendar © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Events added to your Google Calendar -- either manually or automatically via Gmail -- will be viewable in Google Maps for quick access to directions to your upcoming events. For now, these updates will only be available within the Google Maps app on Android. How to view your Google Calendar events in Google Maps There is no special setup to start using the new feature. Calendar entries will automatically begin to populate within the Google Maps app, so long as they have location data, as will events, reservations and invitations from Gmail. Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET To view your events in Google Maps, you will first need the latest update for the app, version 9.38.1, which rolled out to most users on September 30. You also need to be signed into Google Maps and Google Calendar with the same Google account, and you must have Web & App Activity turned on in Google Maps settings. To ensure this is on, open Google Maps, go to Settings > Personal content. If under App history it reads Web & App Activity is on, the feature is already enabled. If not, tap to open the menu and tap the toggle switch to enable it. Once some calendar entries with location data have been added to your calendar, give Maps some time to populate the data. Then, you can view the entries in a few different ways. Your places The most direct way is to tap the hamburger button in the upper left corner of the Google Maps app to expand the side navigation panel. Tap Your places and tap the UPCOMING tab. This tab shows all the events that have been populated into Google Maps from both Gmail and your Google Calendar. Tapping on any of the entries will take you to the pin drop in the map view so you can quickly get directions and navigate to the event. Map view Enlarge Image Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET Alternatively, you can locate events in the map view simply by scrolling and panning around. Events will be denoted by the name of the location (not the event name) and the time and date of the event. Search You can also find events by searching for things like my reservations or my flights within the Google Maps app. Directions Events will also appear in Directions. Just open the Google Maps app and tap the blue Directions button (the blue circle with a white diamond and rightward facing arrow in the middle) in the lower right corner. Not all events will appear here, only those happening soon. How to opt out If an event is showing in Maps and you don't want it to, you can easily hide it. Go to Your places and tap to open the UPCOMING tab. Tap the action overflow button to the right of any event and select Dismiss to hide it. If for any reason you don't want Google Maps to show your calendar entries at all, you can opt out of the feature altogether by opening the Google Maps app and going to Settings > Personal content > Web & App Activity is on and toggling the feature off. Photo by Screenshot by Taylor Martin/CNET Get directions to events without the update If this integration doesn't sound entirely new, that's because it isn't. Calendar entries have appeared in other places -- such as Google Now (and you notification shade) -- for years now. If the new Maps integration isn't working for you yet, you have another option. Events happening in the near future should appear under the Upcoming section of the Google app and in your notifications. If your events have a location set, Google will tell you when you need to leave to make it to the event on time. Event cards in the Google app also provides a dropdown menu to allow you to select your transportation method, your starting location and how early you want to arrive. After you've made your selection, tapping in the area that tells you when you should leave will open navigation to the event.

If you did, you should go check it out. The post is Explore important insights from your data — automatically. I have access to a number of Google Analytics accounts, and I can say this about the suggestions shown in this new feature from Google Analytics – they are worth looking at and thinking about. A couple of the accounts I looked at offered 10 suggestions for changes. Some of these suggestions simply point out that some content on the site you are looking at saw increases in traffic recently, pointing out the URLS of that content. Frankly, that is what inspired me to write this post – it seemed to be a topic related to other posts on my site that had been drawing lots of traffic. If you haven’t been paying much attention to the analytics related to your website, it can be a helpful thing to do. I also recommend spending some time on the Website of Google’s Analytic’s evangelist Avinash Kaushic, reading articles such as The Biggest Mistake Web Analysts Make… And How To Avoid It! I like how he focuses upon business insights, which is something that most site owners want to see. Your analytics program can do more than just tell you how many people are visiting your website – it can offer you suggestions and ideas on how to improve you site and provide a better experience to visitors of your site. The automated assistant suggestions can provide some ideas for changes you can make from the data collected by your analytics program. The blog post tells us that Google Analytics will keep on offering new automated assistant suggestions over time, so it’s worth revisiting those and seeing if they update over time. Please note that this feature of Google Analytics is available only in the mobile app, so that’s where you should look. It’s something that I will now be looking at on client’s sites, and something I recommend that everyone look at. I do think it’s worth using Google’s machine learning to see if it can offer actual business insights that can make a difference to your business. If you give it a shot, and it provides you with a helpful suggestion, please let us know. Thanks.

Bill Slawski says: 09/10/2016 at 6:15 pm Hi Calgary SEO Solutions, Whether or not you agree with the suggestions in this new automated assistant or not; the chance to receive suggestions that might be founded upon actual business insights is a good opportunity. The Occam’s Razor website is definitely a thoughtful one, worth spending some time at. Dave Durden says: 09/11/2016 at 3:20 am Hi Bill, This was a real eyeopener, thank you! It’s interesting to see how automation and AI are turning simple data into actionable insight. I’m intrigued to see the extent to which automation will evolve in the future – perhaps fully automated consultancy companies? Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 11:50 am Hi Dave, I don’t know if we will see fully automated consulting; but it is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Soti says: 09/11/2016 at 12:52 pm Hi Bill, i just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes. The new analytics of google, that’s similar what i searched for. Thank you. Bill Slawski says: 09/11/2016 at 6:03 pm Hi Soti, You’re welcome. I thought this was interesting enough so that as many people as possible should hear about it – it provides all of us a boost when it comes to analytics, even those of us who don’t know how to take advantage of the statistics associated with our sites. Adrian says: 09/12/2016 at 4:26 am I came across this new feature yesterday and my first reaction was …. blah another Google trick to try to get me to commit to bigger spending on their ad network, but then i checked again and noticed that some of the reports are very insightful and after all tips coming from the horses mouth are always to be given some consideration ! Ashish says: 09/13/2016 at 12:58 pm I have been using Google analytics for quite a while now, Although it provides the good information but times to times it is not always correct if we compare it to other premium services. Beside that I really loved your article. Keep posting Thanks Chris says: 09/13/2016 at 8:56 pm I’m glad I came across this tonight. I didn’t even realize there was more insight and advice coming straight from Google that I could use for my business and clients sites. Thank you! Jack says: 09/15/2016 at 8:58 am I second that. Though the data is not accurate, and I personally find some number being listed wrong there. But the thing is, those are just estimates, of the past month’s trend. And the are just precise approximations. I often study Google trends along with that, make a guess on the exact search volume which a potential keyword might fetch. What do you think about this method, Bill? Hussain Omar says: 09/16/2016 at 1:32 am Hey Bill, This is my first visit to your blog and I really loved it. And yes, the analytics software should provide more than just visits figures, I think Moz and SEMrush do provide suggestions on the paid subscriptions, but if Google will provide it, that will be a nice feature to try. Thanks for sharing! Regards Hussain Stephen Love says: 09/16/2016 at 3:56 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for the information and the heads up, having just passed my analytics exam i will certainly follow up on some of the links you have provided to get a better understanding of how this could benefit us. Matthew says: 09/16/2016 at 10:54 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for sharing the articles within your post. I’m still relatively beginner level in understanding Google Analytics and I took the advice you shared on this article which has helped my understanding greatly so I appreciate it. These were things I never knew to think about until I read here so I look forward to many more of your posts. Am going to experiment with the automated assistant suggestions in the mobile app. Abdul Waheed says: 09/19/2016 at 10:20 am Great info about analytics, thanks for sharing that, Bill says: 09/19/2016 at 1:07 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for pointing this out. The suggestions provided by Google Analytics helped me identify a couple of new topics to write about. Interesting that it is only available on the mobile app. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:11 pm Hi Bill, I wondered about the availability of this feature only on Mobile, too. I guess they wanted to see if they could influence more people to use the mobile app, by making this feature exclusive to mobile. Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:13 pm Hi Abdul, You’re welcome. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/19/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Matthew, I hope it goes well. The suggestions I’ve been seeing look interesting. I think implementing those would be helpful in getting you to learn more. teddy slim says: 09/19/2016 at 6:14 pm Clearly, Google is trying to own the web and I’m not with Google monopolizing the net Candice S says: 09/19/2016 at 8:52 pm Bill thank your your post! yes google analytics is not very accurate and everytime a customer enter by mobile and change to view in desktop it simply count as two! but the view duration keep underestimate! yet the good thing about analytics is they can filter bots access.will check the automated assistant and get back again here after testing. hope google can do a better job! Harish Negi says: 09/20/2016 at 6:21 am Google is making Life easy for bloggers. Will definitely use this. Thanks for bringing into knowledge. Chicago SEO Pros says: 09/21/2016 at 2:56 pm Any help from Google, in any form, is much appreciated. Sometimes my brain gets so wrapped up in knots trying to decipher what little reliable data there is. Thank you for the tips. faran says: 09/23/2016 at 6:36 am first i wouldn’t know what to do with my writing but google makes it easier, and also word press gives direction. thank you for you information sharing David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 3:56 pm Thank you for your enlightening article, I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to installing the mobile app. I will also share my thought about considering any suggestions coming from this Google Bot. (i.e. Automated Assitant) It has been my experience that the G-Bots all support and follow the same Google Guidelines. Just saying… David S. Freid says: 09/24/2016 at 4:04 pm Great Post! I was unaware of this feature and will look forward to the app. I also would like to share that personally, I would have to consider any suggestions coming from a G Bot. It has been my experience that all G Bots support and follow the same Google Guidelines. I should add, this coming from one that considers himself a “Google Guideline Junkie”. “Real SEO has no ending… you can always something to optimize, better. Jim says: 09/24/2016 at 5:12 pm Hi Bill, do you agree if google analytic will track all your data and decrease your position in SERP ? I need your reason.Thank you Bill Sara Mazher says: 09/25/2016 at 2:58 am It is interesting that Google is offering these suggestion. I guess we will learn how helpful they are by keeping an eye upon them, and seeing what they suggest. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:27 am Hi Jim, This new feature from Google on the Mobile Google App provides machine learned insights for you to apply to your site and has nothing to do with affecting your position in Search results. Take a look at the suggestions that it offers, and see if they are something that you want to apply to your site; you don’t have to, but it’s possible that they might help you site. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:33 am Hi Teddy, I’m not sure that this GA assistant is aimed at Google monopolizing the Web. Take a look at the suggestions, and if you want to follow them, try them out. If you think they may cause a problem, then don’t. I do think they are worth looking at, though. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:36 am Hi Candice, I hope it offers you some helpful suggestions. I’ve been noticing the suggestions have been updating, but the Assistant was right that I should write a post like this one, geared towards providing some suggestions and advice the way this one has. Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:38 am Hi Harish, I hope it is helpful for you. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/25/2016 at 10:55 am Hi David, I hope the suggestions it may offer you are helpful ones. Wade Cockfield says: 09/25/2016 at 8:50 pm Thanks for the article looks like I will have to start using the app rather than desktop. Alisha says: 09/27/2016 at 12:46 am Thanks for sharing these useful informations regarding google analytics. It is really helpful for people like me. Lakhyajyoti says: 09/27/2016 at 9:48 am I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for the awesome share. Kettletop Tea says: 09/27/2016 at 10:49 am Great blog. Fully informative. I am also seo executive , so thank for blog. David says: 09/27/2016 at 6:57 pm Not gonna lie, I didn’t even know there was a mobile app for Google Analytics (though it doesn’t surprise me). I’ve never really found the need to check my analytics when I was somewhere I couldn’t access my computer, but I guess I’ll have to download it now if only to check out this apparently mobile-exclusive feature! Mike Mallery says: 09/29/2016 at 8:38 pm Hi Bill. I stumbled upon your blog, and I can say that I am happy I did. Great information to be found here. More on the subject, though – I always find it interesting that so many businesses are looking for the answers found within GA; however, they always seem to be terrified of anything technology related. As you pointed out, there is a great deal of information to be found within GA. With a little effort and understanding, so many business owners could have a much better grasp on the performance of their site(s) and how they can improve. However, I suppose that ignorance keeps some of us in business. Not to drag this out too much longer, but thank you for the links to these articles I have missed. They are on my ‘to read’ list over the weekend. Keep churning out the great content. patel vaishali says: 09/29/2016 at 11:23 pm Yes, I am using Google Assistant by the first day of its launch. It is awesome. Machine learning goes beyond its expectations. Google is back with the bang. seo service says: 09/30/2016 at 3:49 am Nice post Bill. Nice informative post.I knew about the Google Analytics toll which is available on PC but didn’t know about the mobile version of it. I’ll definitely try it. Noman says: 09/30/2016 at 8:23 am Really good news for us.This time we will get a lot of valuable data.but what about desktop user? I think this service must be available for desktop user too.thanks for your informative post. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:31 am Hi Mike, Google Analytics contains some useful information, but the suggestions that it offers can sometimes be missed by people when they use it. The value of this automated assistant is in its ability to make clear suggestions that are easy to follow. It suggested that I write a post that was similar to other ones based upon information that was very actionable, which lead me to write this post. I’m glad I listened to it – it was good advice, and a lot of people seem to have missed the Google blog post announcing the GA assistant, which I wouldn’t have seen because I hadn’t been using the mobile version of the app. I need to go look now, and see if it has any updates. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:33 am Hi Patel, I’m happy with the suggestions that I’ve been seeing from the automated assistant. Yes, it’s analytics and not SEO, but it is helping me improve my website, and there is value in that. 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:37 am Hi SEO Service, I can only guess that Google wanted to see if they could get more people using the mobile version of Google Analytics if they offered the Assistant exclusively through that mobile version. It forced me to give it a try, and it was worth trying, I’m liking what it is suggesting. Going to try it out again right now. Bill Slawski says: 09/30/2016 at 11:46 am Hi Noman, I’ve taken to working with my phone and tablet next to my desktop computer – the notifications from those tell me about whether I have new messages on social media. I suspect that Google might make that Automated assistant available on desktop versions of Google Analytics some time soon. We’ll see when they do. Matt says: 09/30/2016 at 4:04 pm It is honestly sad that I am an SEO and didn’t know this. I’m goinfor such informative article. Really most of the internet user not aware about this new automated assistant. Marbella says: 10/16/2016 at 12:47 pm I have been using GA Assistant for last few weeks. Really love the features of the new tool. Thanks for share ,it is awesome. Ascendant SEO says: 10/21/2016 at 1:14 pm Thanks for your time in sharing this article. Analytics have definitely yielded a few helpful nuggets over the years for us. Obviously, it’s always helpful to be open to solutions and opportunities wherever they appear from. This topic relates in my mind to the basic issue of whether or not to become a Google Partner and go through the Adwords and Analytics training and certification. It’s interesting to meet people in the SEO space that write off the whole opportunity because they see Google as an opponent. In my experience with the program, I’ve learned a ton and am always reminded that Google has created a huge opportunity for us. Indeed, we need to be careful not to overlook the opportunities right in front of us. Analytics is one of those. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:45 pm Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. InfoCreeds says: 11/06/2016 at 11:31 pm Yeah, that’s great. Google new automated assistant is great and also in India it is released in Local language (Hindi). It is improved after you are using it.

One minute a giant bid battle is brewing for Twitter, the next, all but one of its supposed suitors are running for the hills. With Google, Disney and Apple all reportedly ruling out a takeover of the struggling social network, only Salesforce is left in the running, with no guarantee it will come forward with a genuine offer. Twitter has been struggling since its early days as a public company, and some critics would argue that its mistake was joining the stock market in the first place. Now, with its options dwindling fast, it faces a bleak future. Certainly the market thinks its prospects as an independent company are pretty dismal: Twitter’s share price plunged more than 20pc after the news that the number of potential bidders had dropped to one. What a dramatic change in fortunes for a company that burst onto the stock market amid huge fanfare just three years ago. At the time, investors thought they were backing the next Facebook or Google and ploughed into its shares, leaving its founder and early backers sitting on huge fortunes. It floated at $26 a share and by the end of the first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Twitter’s stock price had hit nearly $45: the listing was hailed as a slam-dunk on Wall Street. However, within months, several analysts had downgraded the company, and the blue bird has been back-pedalling ever since. Its shares are now languishing at less than $20. Wall Street is notoriously bad at valuing tech companies, but Twitter is in danger of being remembered alongside other over-hyped ventures that left shareholders with badly burnt fingers, such as Zynga and Groupon. The bidding debacles raises fears that Twitter could have been overvalued like Groupon Twitter’s problems are well documented: it has yet to make a profit and its user numbers have ground to a halt. Management, including founder Jack Dorsey, who has returned as chief executive, seem unsure about how to reverse its fortunes. Its biggest problem perhaps is that Twitter wants to be a real business yet no one has worked out whether one exists. It’s traffic doesn’t generate transactions, like with Google, and users don’t spend long periods on the site, like Youtube or Facebook, so its prospects are uncertain. Maybe a very different future awaits? Some critics think it is best suited to becoming another online public service, along the same lines as Wikipedia. It may sound fanciful but unless Twitter’s management come up with a proper plan soon, the social network’s days may be numbered. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey returned to the floundering social network Credit: Bloomberg Cautionary tale The fate of Twitter should provide a cautionary tale for UK investors as they ponder the forthcoming return of Misys to the stock market this month. The software giant’s boss insists that it has been transformed. He would say that, of course. Nadeem Syed and senior management are sitting on shares worth a staggering £330m, as we reveal today. The company’s private equity backer, Vista, and a long list of investment banks working on the float, also stand to profit handsomely. However, a cynic might argue that the biggest transformation that looks to have taken place is the jump in the company’s debt pile. In the four years Misys has been in private hands, its borrowings have ballooned from £107m to £1.3bn. Misys provides software for the world's biggest banks Credit: Bloomberg Vista points out that Misys has undertaken two big deals since de-listing, and revenue and earnings have also risen during its ownership, but at the relatively pedestrian pace of 0.7 times and two times respectively, against a 12-times jump in debt. This, then, has a strong whiff of the classic private equity flip, which were common before the financial crisis but looked to have been stubbed out after investors had their fingers burnt too many times. Boomerang floats, where companies go private, then return to the stock market, come with a particular health warning, because too often they have undergone little real change during private ownership.   In the case of Misys, there is even more reason to be sceptical, given its dubious record last time it was a public company. Its last couple of years were so uninspiring that when Vista swooped in 2012, some investors almost seemed relieved to see the back of it.

That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)   PCMag.com Compared with Amazon's Echo, Google Home -- a compact speaker you can ask to turn off the lights, check the weather, and play music -- might seem like a latecomer to the smart home party. It doesn't arrive until November, while the Echo has been conversing with connected home enthusiasts for nearly two years and has two spinoff devices, the Echo Dot and Tap. But the $129 Google Home has one huge advantage over the Alexa-powered Echo, Siri, and every other personal digital assistant on the market: Google already knows everything about you and pretty much everything that's on the internet. That omnipotence was on full display at Home's debut in San Francisco yesterday, where PCMag got to play with it. All you have to do is say is "OK, Google, tell me about my day," and the diminutive speaker launches into a monologue about your life. It will tell you the weather, how long it will take you to get to work, what's on your calendar, and a news briefing from a source of your choice. All of that is pulled from Google products you probably already use, like Gmail, Calendar, and Maps, though you can disable access to certain corners of the Google ecosystem if you want to. Of course, Google Home also has access to Google's Web search, which means instant answers to a huge variety of questions, from the New England Patriots' season record (3-1) to the name of the Canadian prime minister (Justin Trudeau). Google Home also works well as a music server, beaming songs from a variety of cloud sources. At launch, you'll be able to chose from Spotify, Pandora, YouTube Music, Google Play Music, and TuneIn. Like everything else, playing audio is customizable. You can simply tell Home to play some jazz, or you can ask it to play a curated Spotify playlist on your living room surround sound system, with Google Cast making the connection. To accomplish the latter, you'd say something like "OK, Google. Play Beyoncé on my speakers," assuming they're connected to a Chromecast Audio. Google Home is always listening, and you can say "OK, Google" any time you want it to respond. In the crowded demo room, with many journalists and Google employees all speaking at once, it only understood about half of the commands I tried. But Google says that its omnidirectional microphone is designed to filter out anything that's not a human voice, so it should work well in a quieter room. To adjust the volume, there's a touch interface on the top of the speaker that's reminiscent of an iPod click wheel or a rotary telephone. You slide your finger in a clockwise circular motion, and lights illuminate to indicate increased volume. The device's design is inspired by wineglasses and candles, so it looked great in the Martha Stewart-esque demo room. It will also likely bring a touch of class to your living room or kitchen whether or not you've hired an interior designer. The speaker grille, which takes up the bottom of the device, is interchangeable and snaps on with a magnet. Both metal and fabric grilles in various colors are available. If you want Google Home to temporarily stop listening, you can press the mute button on the rear of the speaker. It's the only physical button, which seems appropriate for a device that's designed for voice interaction. Google Home will come with an Android and iOS companion app, which is still under development. It can do things like adjust which news sources or music libraries are connected, as well as control your home's lights and temperature while you're away. (For automation, Home works with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT). I was only offered a brief glimpse of the companion app and wasn't allowed to take photos, but it appeared similar to the Alexa app, albeit with Google's trademark fonts and colors. The big question with Google Home, other than how it stacks up against Echo, is whether or not you're comfortable with giving it so much access to your digital life. Google says you'll be able to prevent Home from accessing certain information sources, but then you'd be robbing the speaker of much of its functionality. Google knows so much about your life anyway that allowing Home to offer that information to you in spoken form probably won't increase your risk of snooping or identity theft.

The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google chief executive Sundar Pichai proclaimed Tuesday that we're evolving from a mobile-first world to an "AI-first world" -- and, of course, that Google is going to be at the forefront of that evolution. But to do that, Google is investing heavily in mobile -- specifically, smartphones. The tech giant introduced two new phones, the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL, at a San Francisco keynote event. The phones boast a camera that Google said earned a top rating for a smartphone camera, an unlimited amount of online photo storage, and a battery that gives you seven hours of battery life from just 15 minutes of charging. The new Pixel phones carry branding that identify them as "Phone by Google," which is a departure from the old Nexus "partner" branding but a crucial turn in what the company is trying to do: owning the phones as its own. Despite the fact that both are made by HTC, Google takes credit for designing the phones around Google Assistant, the tech giant's answer to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. The idea behind Assistant is that Google wants to build a Google for each person, not just a Google for everyone, Pichai said. Users will be able to ask broad questions such as, "OK Google, what do I have to do today?" and more conversational queries that (ideally) won't have your so-called smart assistant flummoxed by your phrasing. "Why should we build hardware?" said Rick Osterloh, Google's newly appointed head of hardware. His answer was something we've heard from Apple for years: that building hardware and software together allows companies to take full advantage of both, by designing them for each other. Yet, while Osterloh borrowed some familiar phrases from Apple, Google's pitch came with a twist. The next revolution, Osterloh said, will take place at the intersection of hardware and software together -- with AI in the middle. "The technology needs to be smart and just work for you," Osterloh said. The Pixel phones start at $649, and will have either 32 GB or 128 GB of storage. It is also compatible with Google's new VR headset, the Daydream View. The phones will come in three colors -- which Google has oddly named "Quite Black," "Very Silver" and "Really Blue." In the United States, it will be a Verizon exclusive. Pixel will also be available unlocked on the Google Store.

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman Bloomberg     Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a yearlong odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company's retail efforts. What's more, it's inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies' in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google's digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa and Apple's Siri. "We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome," UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It's working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google's online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn't enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. "Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships," he said. Many of Google's past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google's target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, California headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google's sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn't want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product's complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google's new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a "journey," gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone's full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. "We're in it for the long run," he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can reabsorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company's sales aspirations. "In markets where we do business, we're definitely going to want meaningful share," he said. "But it's highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume." Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple's devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. "The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system," he said.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   PCMag.com     Google seems to think we live lonely lives. As it positions its Google Home as a flexible virtual assistant, it doesn't seem to know what to do if a Google home is full of different people with different tastes. This is especially key for Google, because its Assistant is dependent on assembling a profile of your lifestyle and desires based on your Google account. Yes, that's creepy; the idea that Google is surveilling you so intensely that it's constructing a profile of all of your tastes and preferences. But that's what it's doing. If you don't like it, don't buy a Google Home. Also, probably don't use Gmail. Setting that aside, at our house, we have three people with different tastes and opinions on things. We have different to-do lists and different sets of reminders, sure, but the more you get into the "intelligent assistant" world, the more answers are going to become different based on preferences. Take the ubiquitous "traffic to work" query that these assistants always like to show in their demos. Most American households have two people in them who go to work at different times, at different places. But that's just the least subtle tip of the iceberg. A smart assistant with knowledge of TV preferences, for instance, could deal with the query "put something on TV that's the next episode of something I was watching." My daughter doesn't want to unwind with Person of Interest, and Steven Universe is not my first choice in entertainment. It's good and all, just not my first choice. That said, folks in a single household shouldn't have their libraries and preferences held completely separate. If my daughter asks me to buy Steven Universe, I shouldn't have to worry about adding a payment method to her account. Google, Amazon, and Apple all have family sharing options on most of their products to solve this problem. Amazon allows multiple accounts on its Echo virtual-assistant products. Just say "switch accounts," and it'll change who it thinks is talking to Alexa. But Google confirmed that Google Home will only work with one account: @saschasegan Hi! Today, Google Home supports a single account on the device but you can use multiple accounts with your music services. This seems to be an early product issue. Google solved the multiple-accounts problem on Android in 2012. Since Google Home isn't coming out until November, hopefully it'll be solved by then. The Echo's "switch account" command is a little clumsy, true. Ideally, these voice interfaces should be able to tell the difference between the voices of different people in a household, and it would surprise me if that's not possible given the Skynet level of cloud computing going on at both Google and Amazon. And once you have a family set up, there are more interesting things Google Home could do. For instance, I could ask Google Home how many hours my daughter has spent watching Chromecast over the past week, and to tell me when that goes past 10 hours. Or my wife could leave a note for when I get home, that only I could hear. Google Home is going to need some sort of multiple-user function if it's going to be a working intelligent assistant in a family context. Hopefully, it'll come by launch.

Comments By Mike Elgan Follow Computerworld | Oct 8, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Artificial Intelligence Emerging Technology Search Mobile & Wireless Personal Technology Comments Star Trek got it right: In the future, we'll use computers by talking to them. Google held an event this week and new hardware got most of the attention. Google unveiled a couple of Google-built Pixel phones, Google Wi-Fi home mesh routers, the Google Home virtual assistant appliance, a new 4k Chromecast Ultra streaming media box and the Daydream View VR headset. Critics say Google is copying and competing directly with Apple with the Pixel phones and with Amazon with Home. But this misses the point. Google believes that artificial intelligence (A.I.) virtual assistants (VA) and the conversational user interface (CUI) will largely supplant search engines and mobile apps for many users. We're moving into an "A.I.-first world," according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Simply put, all that means is you talk to a computer. It "understands" what you say no matter how you say it. Then the computer does things for you based on those conversations. Google is betting the company on its own version of this interface, called Google Assistant. And it's a bet I think they'll win. The last user interface The artificially intelligent conversation agent is the last user interface. The entire history of human-computer user interfaces has been about applying ever increasing amounts of compute power to making the machines work harder to interact in a way that's easier for people. Humans are hardwired for talking to each other, so the most human-compatible interface is one that has conversations with us. Trouble is, people are able to converse the way we do because of a complex mixture of human psychology and knowledge. A.I. will need to simulate human psychology and gather massive knowledge in order to hold even the most basic conversation. But wait! What about Google Now? Google Now can be safely categorized as a non-A.I. virtual assistant. It's like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and other virtual assistants. Nice, but not A.I. Assistant is more adaptive. It learns, both to become more generally competent and also to personalize. With personalization, Assistant remembers facts about you. I typed in "My wife's name is Amira Elgan," and Assistant responded with: "OK, I'll remember that." You can use the command "Remember" to make Assistant your own repository of handy information. For example, you can say: "Remember my bike combo is 397." Five years from now, you can ask Assistant what your bike combo is, and it will tell you. The important thing to know about Assistant is that it learns and uses facts about you, personally. It accesses Google's Search and Knowledge Base information. And it will do things such as control your home appliances and make your dinner reservations. That omnipresent A.I. will do it all. Unlike Google Now (or, for that matter, Siri, Alexa and Cortana), Assistant should be able to "figure things out," even with a cryptic or vague request. The ability to do this should improve over time as users rank responses. Assistant should also make minor decisions. So if you're in your car and say: "Play 'Gold' from Kiiara," that song will play through your car's sound system. But if you say the same thing at home, it will play through either your Home device or your Chromecast, depending on which you tend to prefer. Another Assistant skill is that it pays attention to (or, depending on your views on privacy, "spies on") your conversations and interjects helpful information and links, such as restaurant recommendations. If you're doing this in Google's Allo, both parties see the recommendations. Assistant gets even more contextual with a Pixel phone. A long press on the home button while you're looking at a photo, for example, returns personalized search results based on the content of the photo (It's basically the Google Now On Tap feature extended to Assistant and the new phones). We'll always have other user interfaces -- virtual, mixed and augmented reality, for example. But these are for experience. For information, the interface will be conversation. You'll be able to stop worrying about devices, apps, platforms and all the rest. You just talk, and Assistant makes it happen. That's the vision, anyway. When A.I. chooses bots for you Google is planning to open up Assistant to developers via a platform called Actions on Google. Developers won't build "apps" or even "bots," according to Google's lingo, but "Actions." These "Actions" can be either Direct Actions or Conversation Actions. Direct Actions are simple query-response events. So an airline might build Direct Actions so that a question about when a flight lands returns the estimated landing time. Conversation Actions are harder to build but easier to use. They involve back-and-forth. So an airline's Conversation Action might enable you to ask: "Which weekend in October has the cheapest price for flying to Vegas"? In response, the Action might initially gather more information, asking "Do you mind a stop-over?" for example. With Conversation Actions, the interaction involves the "bot" not only giving answers and doing things for you (such as booking those tickets), but also asking you questions to get more information. Google last month bought a two-year-old Silicon Valley startup called API.ai, whose technology will be offered to developers for building Assistant Conversation Actions. (Awkwardly, API.ai has it's own app called "Assistant," which reportedly has some 20 million users.) A smattering of companies have already jumped on board to offer third-party additions to Assistant. These include news sources like CNN, CNBC, The Huffington Post, ABC News Radio, CBS Sports, CBS Radio News and others; music sites such as Tunein, Pandora, iHeart Radio and Spotify; food-related brands like Food Network, Vivino and OpenTable; and home automation companies like SmartThings. Intriguingly, crowdsourced information services Quora and Jelly have also signed up. Today, Amazon's Alexa is far ahead of other virtual assistants in the integration of third-party apps or bots -- or "skills," as Amazon calls them. Alexa now has more than 3,000 "skills," according to Amazon. While "skills" are great, Amazon's system doesn't work for mass adoption. "Skills" have to be discovered and installed using the Alexa phone app. Memorization is required by the user to call up a skill. This works well for a tiny number of skills. But once that number exceeds a dozen or two, most people will likely forget which "skills" they've installed, as well as the words that launch them. Because Assistant uses A.I., it should understand the result you want, then often choose -- or at least offer -- third-party integrations for you. Google hasn't announced this feature, and the company was unwilling to comment on it when I reached out to them. But I think the success of Assistant will depend on it. A.I.-selected third-party bots enable you to use thousands of bots, not just a few. You won't have to memorize anything. Just talk to Assistant like you would a person, and Assistant's A.I. should figure it out and make decisions about how to respond. I think it's clear that, despite coming from behind, Google's Assistant will gain far more and better support than Amazon's Alexa, in part because Google's hardware, software and online reach is far wider. Assistant will be everywhere. Why Home is so important A.I. virtual assistant apps and bots are free and easy. But when consumers buy a virtual assistant appliance like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, they're essentially expressing their brand preference, and that preference is likely to stick. That's why lots of companies will ship such devices. Samsung this week announced that it would acquire a startup called Viv Labs, which was founded by three members of the Siri team when Apple bought Siri in 2010. Viv is a Siri-like virtual assistant, but with multifaceted agency, meaning that it can combine services. You should be able to say things like "I'd like to go to a good Italian restaurant." In response to that simple, natural language phrase, Viv could take note of your location, use a service that ranks restaurants, make a reservation at the nearest good one and call you an Uber. In other words, like Google's plans for Assistant, Viv can use A.I. to choose the third-party integration that makes sense. Viv is the closest thing we have to Google's Assistant. Samsung unveiled an Amazon Echo-like virtual assistant appliance in April called Otto. I think Samsung will ship Otto, and it should be powered by Viv -- as should Samsung phones, TVs and other products. It's a near certainty that Microsoft will eventually ship a Cortana virtual assistant appliance. Facebook is a prime candidate to create a "social" virtual assistant appliance, one that might work with Messenger and Facebook's M virtual assistant bot. And Apple at some point will probably ship a virtual assistant appliance of some kind that runs Siri. Why Google Assistant should win With all this future competition, it's clear that Google is in the best position. The effectiveness and success of an A.I. virtual assistant depends on three factors. First, the quality of the A.I. The smarter the software -- and the better able it is to understand you no matter how you talk -- the more useful and usable it will be. Two years ago, Google acquired an A.I. startup called DeepMind Technologies, which makes A.I. so smart it beats humans in Atari Breakout and Go. The second factor is personal data. By leveraging Gmail, Searches, Contacts, Calendar, YouTube and other services, Google can easily have the best and most personal user data to apply to personal assistant relevance. The third factor is ubiquity. Consumers won't want to switch between virtual assistants. They'll want the one that's always present. Google is uniquely positioned to be everywhere, from phones to watches to TVs and even Apple's iOS. Google Assistant is already the most widely distributed. Alexa isn't available as a text-chat bot in a messaging app. Facebook's M is only available in Messenger. Siri isn't available on Android phones. Finally, there's a level of habit and trust with Google. To look something up on the Internet is to "Google" it. Assistant will change that to "OK Google" it. Talking to A.I. is the last user interface. The race is on. So far, it looks like Google is going to win.

The question is: Whose A.I.? Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 08 October, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Star Trek got it right: In the future, we'll use computers by talking to them. Google held an event this week and new hardware got most of the attention. Google unveiled a couple of Google-built Pixel phones, Google Wi-Fi home mesh routers, the Google Home virtual assistant appliance, a new 4k Chromecast Ultra streaming media box and the Daydream View VR headset. Critics say Google is copying and competing directly with Apple with the Pixel phones and with Amazon with Home. But this misses the point. Google believes that artificial intelligence (A.I.) virtual assistants (VA) and the conversational user interface (CUI) will largely supplant search engines and mobile apps for many users. We're moving into an "A.I.-first world," according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Simply put, all that means is you talk to a computer. It "understands" what you say no matter how you say it. Then the computer does things for you based on those conversations. Google is betting the company on its own version of this interface, called Google Assistant. And it's a bet I think they'll win.

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Edward Helmore in Pittsburgh Saturday 8 October 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.28 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh, some may have wondered why the tech company had chosen America’s former capital of steel for its road test into the future. But for those in the know, Pennsylvania’s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east – and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, pre-revolution forest trails. Then there are the city’s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at Carnegie-Mellon University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field. Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh Read more It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city’s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city’s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city’s premier boosters – many locals or returning natives – sought to describe the city’s upswing. The twin keys to the city’s current success, says the festival’s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine – eds and meds – that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that’s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh’s tech university departments have more options to stay. “Eds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,” says Law. “UPMC – University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.” Correspondingly, the city’s arts and culture are thriving. “The City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,” according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. There’s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime Read more “At the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,” say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche.com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a not-for-profit organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to early-stage startups. “When I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now it’s becoming fashionable to do so.” Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the city’s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the city’s streets. Many of Uber’s employees were hired directly from Carnegie-Mellon’s computer labs and the state’s approach to the technology – called greenlight governing – effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. “It’s not just about self-driving cars,” says Law. “It’s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities.” Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, “because if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, you’re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. It’s old, it was planned poorly, it’s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Uber car drives navigates one of Pittsburgh’s many bridges. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google – which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600 – and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the city’s easy-going regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for auto-automation, widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies. Google’s Mike Capsambelis explains the company’s explicit interest in Pittsburgh is machine learning, a sub-field of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In other words, learning without needing to be explicitly programmed. “It’s uniquely a collaborative place. We tend to work together even when there’s actual competition,” says Capsambelis. Pittsburgh water: expensive, rust-colored, corrosive, and high in lead Read more Rasu Shrestha, chief innovation officer at UPMC, says healthcare is a natural fit for machine learning. Healthcare, he says, is so muchabout billing and book-keeping. “We want to free the data, to empower patients and consumers to take charge of their own data with the right sets of systems,” says Shrestha. “So the question is, how do we do a better job of precision medicine, not just do a better job of billing and documentation? The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation.” Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcare’s copious resources of data – UPMC’s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months – with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: “Let’s create solutions that leverage machine learning and big-data-type technologies to create products we can then commercialize.” There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and tech’s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. “There’s a ton of connections and overlap,” says Capsambelis. “A lot of people will still need cars, but there won’t be as many drivers.” The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon. Not only has tech become a major employer of the university’s graduates, but much of the computational power that was once available only to universities or government laboratories is now available to research. “Having machine learning has really changed the way we do research because the things we used to do at the university, companies can do much better because of their access to huge computing power and big data,” says professor of computer science Lenore Blum. But the city and its promoters at Thrival and Thrill Mill are keen to show off the small entrepreneurs along with the grand-scale technology behemoths that are beginning to occupy the same psychic space in the culture that the robber barons Carnegie and Frick did here in the late 19th century. An app for artists to find spaces, for instance, or a machine-learning ECG device for early stroke detection. Another involves cooking recipes for the sight-impaired. They may not or ever be Google or Uber but they are nonetheless imbibing Pittsburgh’s spirit of innovation. “It looks more like a continuum to us,” says Thrill Mill’s Stephan Mueller, “because we all have this fatal love for Pittsburgh and want to do something for it.” More features Topics Pennsylvania Apple Uber Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

According to a report by Android Police, the search giant has sent an email sent to Google Mobile Services (GMS) partners on October 5th outlining a big change to the core GMS package. From December 1st, core GMS package apps will no longer bundle Hangouts with a new device. But this doesn’t mean that the Google is killing Hangouts, instead it will reportedly be replaced by Google Duo, and it will optional for OEMs to keep Hangouts in default app suite or not, as per the purported email statement by Google, which notes: Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016. This doesn’t come as a surprise because is Google is betting high on its cross-platform Duo, and Hangouts has never been a success. So far we do not see Hangouts been shut down soon, but it is still a possibility we feel.

The question is: Whose A.I.? Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 08 October, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Star Trek got it right: In the future, we'll use computers by talking to them. Google held an event this week and new hardware got most of the attention. Google unveiled a couple of Google-built Pixel phones, Google Wi-Fi home mesh routers, the Google Home virtual assistant appliance, a new 4k Chromecast Ultra streaming media box and the Daydream View VR headset. Critics say Google is copying and competing directly with Apple with the Pixel phones and with Amazon with Home. But this misses the point. Google believes that artificial intelligence (A.I.) virtual assistants (VA) and the conversational user interface (CUI) will largely supplant search engines and mobile apps for many users. We're moving into an "A.I.-first world," according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Simply put, all that means is you talk to a computer. It "understands" what you say no matter how you say it. Then the computer does things for you based on those conversations. Google is betting the company on its own version of this interface, called Google Assistant. And it's a bet I think they'll win. The last user interface The artificially intelligent conversation agent is the last user interface. The entire history of human-computer user interfaces has been about applying ever increasing amounts of compute power to making the machines work harder to interact in a way that's easier for people. Humans are hardwired for talking to each other, so the most human-compatible interface is one that has conversations with us. Trouble is, people are able to converse the way we do because of a complex mixture of human psychology and knowledge. A.I. will need to simulate human psychology and gather massive knowledge in order to hold even the most basic conversation. But wait! What about Google Now? Google Now can be safely categorized as a non-A.I. virtual assistant. It's like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and other virtual assistants. Nice, but not A.I. Assistant is more adaptive. It learns, both to become more generally competent and also to personalize. With personalization, Assistant remembers facts about you. I typed in "My wife's name is Amira Elgan," and Assistant responded with: "OK, I'll remember that." You can use the command "Remember" to make Assistant your own repository of handy information. For example, you can say: "Remember my bike combo is 397." Five years from now, you can ask Assistant what your bike combo is, and it will tell you. The important thing to know about Assistant is that it learns and uses facts about you, personally. It accesses Google's Search and Knowledge Base information. And it will do things such as control your home appliances and make your dinner reservations. That omnipresent A.I. will do it all. Unlike Google Now (or, for that matter, Siri, Alexa and Cortana), Assistant should be able to "figure things out," even with a cryptic or vague request. The ability to do this should improve over time as users rank responses. Assistant should also make minor decisions. So if you're in your car and say: "Play 'Gold' from Kiiara," that song will play through your car's sound system. But if you say the same thing at home, it will play through either your Home device or your Chromecast, depending on which you tend to prefer. Another Assistant skill is that it pays attention to (or, depending on your views on privacy, "spies on") your conversations and interjects helpful information and links, such as restaurant recommendations. If you're doing this in Google's Allo, both parties see the recommendations. Assistant gets even more contextual with a Pixel phone. A long press on the home button while you're looking at a photo, for example, returns personalized search results based on the content of the photo (It's basically the Google Now On Tap feature extended to Assistant and the new phones). We'll always have other user interfaces -- virtual, mixed and augmented reality, for example. But these are for experience. For information, the interface will be conversation. You'll be able to stop worrying about devices, apps, platforms and all the rest. You just talk, and Assistant makes it happen. That's the vision, anyway. When A.I. chooses bots for you Google is planning to open up Assistant to developers via a platform called Actions on Google. Developers won't build "apps" or even "bots," according to Google's lingo, but "Actions." These "Actions" can be either Direct Actions or Conversation Actions. Direct Actions are simple query-response events. So an airline might build Direct Actions so that a question about when a flight lands returns the estimated landing time. Conversation Actions are harder to build but easier to use. They involve back-and-forth. So an airline's Conversation Action might enable you to ask: "Which weekend in October has the cheapest price for flying to Vegas"? In response, the Action might initially gather more information, asking "Do you mind a stop-over?" for example. With Conversation Actions, the interaction involves the "bot" not only giving answers and doing things for you (such as booking those tickets), but also asking you questions to get more information. Google last month bought a two-year-old Silicon Valley startup called API.ai, whose technology will be offered to developers for building Assistant Conversation Actions. (Awkwardly, API.ai has it's own app called "Assistant," which reportedly has some 20 million users.) A smattering of companies have already jumped on board to offer third-party additions to Assistant. These include news sources like CNN, CNBC, The Huffington Post, ABC News Radio, CBS Sports, CBS Radio News and others; music sites such as Tunein, Pandora, iHeart Radio and Spotify; food-related brands like Food Network, Vivino and OpenTable; and home automation companies like SmartThings. Intriguingly, crowdsourced information services Quora and Jelly have also signed up. Today, Amazon's Alexa is far ahead of other virtual assistants in the integration of third-party apps or bots -- or "skills," as Amazon calls them. Alexa now has more than 3,000 "skills," according to Amazon. While "skills" are great, Amazon's system doesn't work for mass adoption. "Skills" have to be discovered and installed using the Alexa phone app. Memorization is required by the user to call up a skill. This works well for a tiny number of skills. But once that number exceeds a dozen or two, most people will likely forget which "skills" they've installed, as well as the words that launch them. Because Assistant uses A.I., it should understand the result you want, then often choose -- or at least offer -- third-party integrations for you. Google hasn't announced this feature, and the company was unwilling to comment on it when I reached out to them. But I think the success of Assistant will depend on it. A.I.-selected third-party bots enable you to use thousands of bots, not just a few. You won't have to memorize anything. Just talk to Assistant like you would a person, and Assistant's A.I. should figure it out and make decisions about how to respond. I think it's clear that, despite coming from behind, Google's Assistant will gain far more and better support than Amazon's Alexa, in part because Google's hardware, software and online reach is far wider. Assistant will be everywhere. Why Home is so important A.I. virtual assistant apps and bots are free and easy. But when consumers buy a virtual assistant appliance like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, they're essentially expressing their brand preference, and that preference is likely to stick. That's why lots of companies will ship such devices. Samsung this week announced that it would acquire a startup called Viv Labs, which was founded by three members of the Siri team when Apple bought Siri in 2010. Viv is a Siri-like virtual assistant, but with multifaceted agency, meaning that it can combine services. You should be able to say things like "I'd like to go to a good Italian restaurant." In response to that simple, natural language phrase, Viv could take note of your location, use a service that ranks restaurants, make a reservation at the nearest good one and call you an Uber. In other words, like Google's plans for Assistant, Viv can use A.I. to choose the third-party integration that makes sense. Viv is the closest thing we have to Google's Assistant. Samsung unveiled an Amazon Echo-like virtual assistant appliance in April called Otto. I think Samsung will ship Otto, and it should be powered by Viv -- as should Samsung phones, TVs and other products. It's a near certainty that Microsoft will eventually ship a Cortana virtual assistant appliance. Facebook is a prime candidate to create a "social" virtual assistant appliance, one that might work with Messenger and Facebook's M virtual assistant bot. And Apple at some point will probably ship a virtual assistant appliance of some kind that runs Siri. Why Google Assistant should win With all this future competition, it's clear that Google is in the best position. The effectiveness and success of an A.I. virtual assistant depends on three factors. First, the quality of the A.I. The smarter the software -- and the better able it is to understand you no matter how you talk -- the more useful and usable it will be. Two years ago, Google acquired an A.I. startup called DeepMind Technologies, which makes A.I. so smart it beats humans in Atari Breakout and Go. The second factor is personal data. By leveraging Gmail, Searches, Contacts, Calendar, YouTube and other services, Google can easily have the best and most personal user data to apply to personal assistant relevance. The third factor is ubiquity. Consumers won't want to switch between virtual assistants. They'll want the one that's always present. Google is uniquely positioned to be everywhere, from phones to watches to TVs and even Apple's iOS. Google Assistant is already the most widely distributed. Alexa isn't available as a text-chat bot in a messaging app. Facebook's M is only available in Messenger. Siri isn't available on Android phones. Finally, there's a level of habit and trust with Google. To look something up on the Internet is to "Google" it. Assistant will change that to "OK Google" it. Talking to A.I. is the last user interface. The race is on. So far, it looks like Google is going to win.

Google Duo to Replace Hangouts as the Main Video-Chatting App for Android Phones GO Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android Oct 8, 2016 10:40 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  In an email to its partners, Google reportedly announced a significant change to the core GMS package for Android smartphones. Starting December, the tech giant will no longer include Hangouts in the list of applications bundled with new hardware. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google stated in the email, according to Android Police. This means that manufacturers will have the option to stop including Google Hangouts on smartphones released in 2017. Users would have to download and install the application from the Play Store if they wish to use it. Google will transform Hangouts into a business communications platform Google intends to replace Hangouts with Duo on the GMS package for Android smartphones and not Allo. Hangouts did offer video-calling options to its users and Google wanted to find a fitting equivalent, in the form of Duo. However, Allo is a much more complex application, with its Google Assistant integration that allows smart replies and lots of other useful features. Allo is currently competing against other popular third-party messaging solutions, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Kik, and LINE. It seems that Google might be trying to transform Hangouts into a business communications platform, so the app will be focusing on the collaborative group productivity market. This means that the app will continue to live on, but it’s unknown for how long. Meanwhile, Google’s Duo continues to gain popularity, as the app surpassed the 10 million downloads mark on the Play Store. It offers an easy way to place video calls, with tools that prevent the app from dropping the call if Wi-Fi or network connectivity is lacking. It also has a very neat Knock Knock feature that shows a video of the caller before picking up. #Google#Duo#Hangouts#Allo#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Allo Developer Lists 7 Most Requested Features, Including SMS Support Google Allo Passes 5 Million Downloads Mark on Android Allo Takes a Step Back on Privacy in Favor of Google Assistant Features Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 Could Use Powerful Exynos 9 Chipsets Inside iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels Leaked Video Reveals Microsoft’s Discontinued Apple Watch Killer Microsoft Reveals How It Made Windows 10 “the Most Secure Windows Ever” New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked AsusWrt-Merlin Provides New Firmware for ASUS Routers - Version 380.63.2 Ultra-Rugged Kyocera DuraForce Pro Goes Official at Sprint Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Coming Soon to T-Mobile    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs Photo Grid APK: Updated November 12th, 11:44 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated November 12th, 11:42 GMT SHAREit APK: Updated November 12th, 11:40 GMT AZ Screen Recorder APK: Updated November 12th, 11:37 GMT Next Lock Screen APK: Updated November 12th, 11:34 GMT ZenUI Launcher APK: Updated November 12th, 11:26 GMT Evie Launcher APK: Updated November 12th, 10:56 GMT Reader comments Samsung Announces Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy S7/S7 edge more on: Samsung Galaxy S7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. androidn_headerMore There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. Read More This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Chennai 2 Singapore Ghibran Ghibran's audio drive V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS cinema Indian cinema Tamil cinema soundtrack & audio “A random, crazy idea has been successfully executed,” says composer M. Ghibran, who is back in Chennai after driving from Chennai to Singapore, across six countries by road. In each country, he released one song from his album for Chennai 2 Singapore. He talks to Chitradeepa Anantharam about the journey, the experiences gained and the lessons learnt. How did you land upon this audio drive idea? I always Google the title of my films. When I typed Chennai to Singapore, I got not only flight details, but a Google map that displayed the road route. This gave me the idea for an audio drive. Why not release the audio along this route, on an audio drive? But when I discussed this idea with my friend and the director of the film, Abbas Akbar, we dismissed it as a stupid thought. What made you take up the audio drive finally? Audio-release functions were becoming boring and monotonous. Kamal Haasan broke the tradition by releasing Uttama Villain’s audio on an app. He inspired me to think out of the box. I thought an audio drive would garner attention. We left on August 12 (coincidentally, my birthday) and returned on September 12. My team comprised of Abbas Akbar (director), Karthick Nallamuthu (cinematographer), Shiv Keshav (media manager in charge of social-media updates about the trip) and my assistant Aravind, who drove almost 80 per cent of the distance. What was the route and how did you prepare yourself? We left Chennai and drove to Vijayawada, Kolkata, Guwahati, Assam, Nagaland and then to Manipur. From there, we proceeded to Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and finally, Singapore. Fans on social media gave us tips and suggestions. I was also working on other projects during the drive, so in the car I had a sort of a mini studio, with battery back-up. We were prepared for various things, but not for earthquakes, landslides and last-minute document cancellation. Any unforgettable experiences? When you look at our videos, one will get the impression that it was just a fun-filled road trip. But, in reality, we faced a lot of legal issues. When we stopped for tea upon reaching Manipur, an earthquake struck. It was followed by another. We were stranded for 10 days without communication. Our families panicked, and especially Karthick’s wife, who was in the eighth month of her pregnancy. When the third tremor of a magnitude of 7.4 occurred, we almost decided to return to Chennai. But the support and encouragement that poured in on social media made us proceed. Those were emotional moments for me and my team. You also mentioned a landslide… When we were about to enter Myanmar, a major landslide delayed our entry into the country. And to top it, our documents were declared invalid, as the country had recently changed its policy. So we had to reapply. The next major hurdle was in Thailand, where the government had imposed a new rule for travellers entering by road. We were expected to get an assurance letter from the local Land Transport Corporation. The border officials seized our vehicle but let the team enter the country. We hired a car and went to Bangkok to meet the officials, who sought an assurance letter from the Indian embassy. But we got zero help from them. Finally, the Singapore embassy issued the assurance letter, and we crossed Thailand. How did it feel when you reached Singapore to a rousing reception? It was a mixed feeling, a sense of achievement. We all are still in the hangover of the trip. It’s a great feeling. Ghibran’s drive diary August 12: Chennai. Song: Vaadi vaadi. Theme: A formula dream song in the Western genre. A relaxed, feel good song. August 19: Bhutan Song: Poda Poda. Theme: Life throws a lot of challenges, and we look at life and say, Poda. This is a rap number, a tongue twister, rendered beautifully by RJ Balaji. This is his first full-length song.. September 2: Myanmar Song: Pogathe. Theme: A sad number. September 7: Thailand Song: Texas Pogiren. Theme: A wacky number. The idea is to make people to react in different ways. September 10: Malaysia: Song: Gun Inbam. Theme: While ‘Poda poda’ challenges life, here life challenges us. The lyrics talk about an unusual way of looking at things September 11: Singapore: Song: Ro Ro Roshini. Theme: The tune makes it sound like a love song, but actually it celebrates death. This is the director’s favourite and he wanted to release this in his hometown, Singapore. Bonus song: To celebrate the success of the audio drive, we launched the female version of ‘Pogadhe’ in Singapore.

Tech on the screen With James Cameron aspiring for his Avatar sequels to be screened in glass-less 3-D, can we expect its technology to be the next big thing in cinema? Yes we can. This sort of an upgrade is sure to draw more people back to theatres. It won’t. Most people prefer watching films on 2-D. Surely. A lot of people don’t like wearing 3-D glasses as they are clumsy and expensive. No. It will just be another excuse to charge more for tickets.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Panoramio, the service which Google acquired in 2007, will show its last image on November 4. Google previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, Tech Crunch reported on Saturday. "Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides programme, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community. As such, we've decided to now close down Panoramio," Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users on Saturday. Google is also encouraging Panoramio users to join its Local Guides programme and to upload photos directly to Google Maps. The users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts need not worry about their photos as Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive.

The more upbeat the music, the more the listener will be motivated to push harder. And now Google is helping to fuel high-intensity workouts by providing the soundtrack to the user's next workout. Google teamed up with the fitness tracking app Runtastic to give Android users workout-inspired playlists that are powered by Play Music. Google Play Music's fitness playlist include a variety of different songs including those that are more than 130 beats per minute, which is the perfect tempo to synchronize with exercise to get the listener's heart rate up, burn calories and work up a sweat. Not only will the playlist keep users pumped since its consists of their favorite songs, but it will also be easier to forget about the burn and get lost in the music. The best part of it is that the Google Play Music ad-free playlists are available for Android users with the Runtastic app for free. While of course this seems to be like a great way to get more users on board Google's music streaming service, Android users don't need to have an account in order to jam along with this partnership. Starting on Friday, Oct. 7, users who launch the Runtastic app can start streaming Google Play Music's fitness playlists that are relevant to their activity. These include "Today's Running Hits" with music from Calvin Harris and Alesso, "Sweaty EDM Workout" with music from Avicii and Armin van Buuren, and "High-Energy Hard Rock" with music from Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. The songs play directly in the Runtastic app so that users can play, pause or skip while keeping track of their workout from one centralized location. This feature could help recruit new users who have Spotify or Apple Music and don't want to keep exiting and launching the two apps and interrupting their workouts. And while the playlists are free for Android users, Google is making sure iOS users don't miss out on what its streaming service has to offer. It announced that it is giving Runtastic users on both Android and iOS devices a free trial to Play Music so that they can stream creating their own playlists to work out to. The ability to stream Google Play Music playlists from Runtastic is now available in more than 60 countries worldwide.

In a world where we rely on nearly 7 billion small screens that’s a tall order--but we’re toasting the first anniversary of AMP with progress the entire initiative can feel good about. From day one, a key focus for AMP has been speed.  Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53% of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. That’s the worst of all worlds for users, businesses, publishers, websites and the mobile web as a whole. For publishers, who were the first to get on board with AMP, the benefits of fast-loading content are super-tangible. In this case study, the Washington Post reported a 23% increase in mobile search users who return within 7 days. And in this case study, one of Europe’s biggest native advertising platforms, plista, conducted its own experiment among premium publishers like n-tv.de, faz.net, abendzeitung.de, and golem.de to measure AMP’s impact on web app widget speed and profitability. Average click-through rates for publishers improved by 220%, while one saw an increase of 600% after the implementation of AMP. To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum. This is clear in everything from the pace of releases of the open source code to the number of participants embracing the AMP format. From Pinterest to Reddit to Bing and Ebay, reports of success after adopting AMP have rolled in in recent months. At Google, we’re doing our part too. In February, we launched AMP in the “Top Stories” section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. In August, we previewed linking to AMPs across the entire mobile search results page. And this month we’re excited to be rolling out that faster experience to mobile users across Europe. Now when you search on your mobile device, you’ll see a label that indicates a page is AMP’d. This doesn’t change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. Today AMP pages load from Google Search in less than one second on average. Beyond just saving time with fast loading pages, AMP also saves data -- AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. To date we have over 600 million AMP documents created by sites all over the world (232 locales and 104 languages). These pages cover news content, retail, travel, recipes, general knowledge and entertainment. That’s a lot of fast-loading pages! The open source initiative is thriving because there is a strong community behind it getting involved in everything from working groups to contributing to the Github page with suggestions, feedback and code spec. While the first year of the AMP Project has gotten off to a good start, there still remains a lot of work ahead.  This roadmap is a good way to stay up to date on what is happening next. We look forward to returning in a year’s time with even more awesome progress as we work together to make the web great for everyone.

Home Industry Tech Google to close location-centric photo sharing service Panoramio Google to close location-centric photo sharing service Panoramio Technology giant Google will shut down Panoramio, the location-centric photo sharing service that the company used to augment its Google Maps and Google Earth services, in November, a media report said. By: IANS | New York | Published: October 8, 2016 2:14 PM Google is also encouraging Panoramio users to join its Local Guides programme and to upload photos directly to Google Maps. (Reuters) Technology giant Google will shut down Panoramio, the location-centric photo sharing service that the company used to augment its Google Maps and Google Earth services, in November, a media report said. Panoramio, the service which Google acquired in 2007, will show its last image on November 4. Google previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, Tech Crunch reported on Saturday. “Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides programme, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community. As such, we’ve decided to now close down Panoramio,” Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users on Saturday. Google is also encouraging Panoramio users to join its Local Guides programme and to upload photos directly to Google Maps. The users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts need not worry about their photos as Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive. Users will still be able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year after November 4. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The smartphones are the flagship HTC 10, HTC One M9, and HTC One E9. HTC might push the update by the end of this year of early 2017. Sony Sony doesn't deliver the updates on time and as a result, their sales are depleting.

The Echo will soon face competition from Google and Apple.

The Amazon Echo, which listens to you, answers questions and carries out tasks like calling an Uber or turning on your lights, is finding a place in millions of living rooms. The Dot and the portable Tap give the Echo's Alexa software even broader reach. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) By MAE ANDERSON, Associated Press Published: October 7, 2016, 11:37 PM A   A NEW YORK — Does your home really need a “smart speaker” to answer questions, call you an Uber, turn off the lights or play music when you ask? You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits on a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the point of gadget was a little difficult to discern. But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Home ‘smart’ Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so third-party developers can create new features for it, much as Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent, a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That’s growing fast, although it’s still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They’re early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. Learning new skills One key to the Echo’s success was Amazon’s willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen “skills” and now has thousands). “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored of their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research’s Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as remote control lights or thermostats. The Echo’s hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don’t need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. Speak to me People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. “I’ve never used Cortana. I don’t use Google and my wife doesn’t use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop said. “I couldn’t really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, a Portland advertising executive, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking — and without having to fire up an app — basically did the trick, he said. Big ambitions Google has catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April, the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot, electronics stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It’s also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot — which it now sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room — and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, says the goal is for Alexa to keep getting smarter as it continues to build new “skills” over the coming years. “The hope is you can ask Alexa anything and it will be able to respond correctly, quickly and be able to be there,” he said.

Well, many marketers are still looking for the right washer/dryer combo for cleaning those clothes. Just like a super appliance store can be full of washers and dryers, the marketplace is full of different tools for combining data, from Microsoft BI to dashboard solutions like Tableau. Google has offered its own data appliance in the form of Data Studio. The solution was first introduced as part of the Google Analytics 360 Suite, the premium version of Google Analytics aimed at enterprise-level reporting needs. But Google decided to introduce a beta version to complement not only its standard analytics solution but for other purposes. The result is now another appliance that offers a central repository for data and report-building. Data Studio offers the ability to combine data from many sources, including AdWords, Google Analytics, Big Query, and Google Sheets. There's provision for SQL database sources as well.  How Data Studio Works  Once logged in, you are taken to a home page that has a layout familiar from other Google services. This means a user experience with large, tablet-friendly selectors and menus that group features by function. There is also a video help selection, to allow you to see how features work via YouTube. If you are ready to start, begin with the Reports and Data Sources selectors in the upper left-hand corner. The Reports selector permits you to create reports and data visualizations. Sample reports are presented immediately in the home page so you can see the range of ideas that you can have for reports. You can copy a demo report, or create your own. The Data Sources selector is meant, obviously, to add the data sources. Once selected, data appears as a schema table on the home page. Like Reports, there are also sample schemata that serve as a guidance for ideas, such as this Adwords example. You can then confirm that you want to add the schema to a report and select the visualization that you want. Visualization choices appear on a bar at the top of the page. Source, dimension, metric, and appearance style appear on the right, allowing adjustments, such as changing a chart scale. Most of the visualization has a drag and drop feel, and can be adjusted as needed. How Data Studios Benefits Data Mining Marketers Data Studio is meant to address a growing complaint among data-savvy analysts who have to offer guidance to time-crunched managers; namely, that the majority of their time is spent on data management tasks rather than analysis. It's a refrain that has worn out its welcome, particularly with the advent of data mining. Through tools like Data Studio, managers are discovering real business value from blending data from different sources and improving reporting plans. Data mining activities foreshadow a wide variety of model creation, ranging from regression to machine learning, thus shifting time available towards analysis rather than setup. To provide that resource shift, Data Studio treats its data sources as reusable components. Users can reuse connections in various reports, and in different combinations within the same page. The sources do not have to be hardcoded in visualization, making maintenance updates easier and quicker. Reusable code is a central concept to R programming. Reusability allows R programmers to recreate models fasters, and allow other programmers to verify models through duplicate the process in creating those results. Verification is a key tenet data mining, and scientific research generally. With Data Studio, enterprises can experiment with how to best use the data available alongside familiar tools. A number of solutions can export data into Google Sheets, and Data Studio Product Manager Nikhil Roy has said that Data Studio was intended as a complement to Google Sheets. Whether data mining or developing dashboards, marketers need to quickly share information with other teams. The ease of doing so has been enhanced with Google Data Studio. Loading links....

Google Duo is taking Hangouts’ place on Android The Verge 10/8/2016 Nick Statt © Provided by The Verge In its ongoing effort to push new chat software, Google won't require Android phone makers to preload the Hangouts app as part of its core mobile app suite starting December 1st, according to Android Police. In its place, the company will instead include Duo, its recently released FaceTime competitor for instant video chatting. Hangouts isn't totally going away. It will remain an optional member of the Google Mobile Services package, which Google requires manufacturers to install so consumers have integral services like the Chrome browser and Google Maps. However, the demotion means Hangouts will have significantly less visibility among new phone buyers if companies do decide to leave it out. This does not mean manufacturers will decide to leave Hangouts wallowing in the Play Store. The app could very well make its way onto Android handsets for many months to come. And the app will be available for download even if it is left out of the GMS suite — that is until Google decides to shutter it. Still, the move is a telling one from the search giant, which has moved aggressively to promote Duo and its new artificial intelligence-powered chat app Allo. It's a bit of a strange move that Allo won't be a mandatory app in the GMS suite, as Android Police points out, but it could be included down the line. Right now, it's clear Google wants to promote video chatting above all else.

Watch: Google Pixel XL First Look Video Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency.

Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.” Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPM Modi appeals to nation: Bear with shortage of currency for another 50 days OpinionAcross the aisle: Old notes for new is not game-changer IndiaIndia agrees to link N-testing to termination of deal with Japan IndiaJaitley tells people to wait, says may take 21 days for ATMs to run normally WorldAt least 52 killed, 100 injured in blast at Shah Noorani's Shrine in Pakistan EntertainmentPadmavati will be extremely difficult, says Deepika Padukone EntertainmentSalman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan praise PM Modi on demonetisation EntertainmentAamir Khan on demonetisation: Things that we need to do for our country, we should do it EntertainmentAs a father, I always support my kids, says Aamir Khan Must Read SportsLive, India vs England, 1st Test, Day 5 in Rajkot SportsEngland’s Baby Boycott shines in his ‘backyard’ Sports‘Outsider’ Narinder Batra takes charge at FIH TechnologyFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg insists fake news on News Feed didn’t help Trump win TechnologyApple iPhone 8 could come with never seen before wireless charging technology: Report TechnologyReliance Jio’s next big offering could hit DTH and broadband services  Deepika, Aishwarya, Shraddha: Fashion hits and misses of the week (November 6 – November 12) Nov 13: Latest News Railways plan to launch PayTM-like e-wallets for booking train tickets Economy, Russia top issues as Bulgarians pick new president South Korea prosecutors likely to question president: Reports Conor McGregor knocks out Eddie Alvarez to make UFC history No need to be anxious, enough cash available, assures RBI                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Google Pixel phone vs Sony Xperia XZ: Which is best for me? By Chris Barraclough 7th Oct 2016 Features Sony Xperia X Series Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones Tweet We compare the new 'made by Google' Pixel phone, with Sony's 2016 flagship mobile the Xperia XZ. What's the difference in terms of specs, camera tech and other features, and which one is best for you? Here's our Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ comparison review. Just this week, Google pulled back the curtain on its 5-inch flagship Pixel phone, packing premium specs for a super-premium price. The Pixel boasts a sharp and colourful Full HD screen, the latest Snapdragon processor and a powerful 12-megapixel camera, but it's also just as expensive as other flagship phones like Apple's iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. So how does the Pixel compare with Sony's Xperia XZ, another super-powered Android handset that just hit the UK last month? Here's our full Pixel vs Xperia XZ comparison review to help you decide. And have a gander at our full hands-on review of the 5-inch Pixel phone, to learn more. Check out our hands-on Pixel XL review too, where we share our first thoughts on the super-sized 5.5-inch version of the Pixel phone. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Specs at a glance Phone Google Pixel Sony Xperia XZ Screen size 5-inches 5.2-inches Screen resolution Full HD 1920x1080 Full HD 1920x1080 Weight 143g 161g Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? No Yes OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Processor Snapdragon 821 Snapdragon 820 Memory 4GB 4GB Storage 32/128GB 32/64GB MicroSD? No Yes Battery 2770mAh 2900mAh Rear camera 12-megapixel 23-megapixel Front camera 8-megapixel 13-megapixel Price From £599 From £500 Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Design Sony's Xperia XZ is a proper hand-filler, although just about usable one-handed. Those rounded edges makes it quite comfortable to hold, while the matte metallic surfacing gives an attractive finish in a selection of shades. It's not impervious to scratches sadly, although these are difficult to see unless the light catches the phone just right. Google's Pixel phone is more compact and a little lighter too, with a slender design that's well suited to one-handed use. Around the back you'll find an unusual blend of glass and metal, which certainly stands out from the rest of the smartphone crowd. It feels quite hardy but we'll be testing that out when we use the Pixel phone as our full-time handset. The Pixel phone isn't water resistant, unlike the Xperia XZ, so you probably shouldn't check your Twitter feed in the bath or anything. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Screen and media Both the Pixel phone and the HTC 10 sport a sharp Full HD screen, which means you'll struggle to make out individual pixels. With either handset you get rich colours that really pop and bring images to life. And both phones will be easy to use in harsh sunlight, thanks to those powerful brightness levels. Sony's Xperia XZ also supports Hi-Res audio when your plug in headphones, for a super-detailed musical experience. In our brief play, the Pixel phone didn't seem to offer the same support. The Pixel phone also doesn't have a microSD memory card slot so you can't expand the on-board storage. Although there is a 128GB model, if you've got £699 hanging around in your wallet. Thankfully the XZ does support microSD, so you can fill up a massive card with loads of movies and more. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: OS and features Sony's Xperia XZ still uses Android Marshmallow, which was released last year, just like every other flagship Android from 2016. But the Pixel phone comes with the latest Android Nougat pre-installed - no surprise, as this is a 'made by Google' mobile. This gives you Google's new Assistant AI straight out of the box, which is basically a step beyond Google Now with its context-aware helpfulness. Of course, the Xperia XZ should get an update to full Nougat soon, but you won't get the Assistant feature because Google is saving that for Pixel handsets alone. Bums. The good news for gamers is that the Xperia XZ does support Remote Play, which means you can stream your PS4 gaming sessions straight to your phone. You can even pair your PS4 controller, with zero latency to spoil the show. Both phones pack a fingerprint sensor, to quickly and securely unlock to your desktops. On the Xperia XZ this is mounted on the edge, while the Pixel phone's is stuck around the back. Both are easy and intuitive to use. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Performance and battery life Gamers and media fans will enjoy a smooth everyday performance from the Xperia XZ, thanks to the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM stuffed inside. We're not expecting to see any sign of slowdown any time soon. That said, the new Pixel phone uses the latest Snapdragon 821 processor, which promises a ten percent increase in performance over the old 820 chipset. In terms of real-life experience, there's unlikely to be any real difference between these two mobiles, at least for some time - but in a year or two, the Pixel may be the smoother operator of these two. As for battery life, the Xperia XZ gives you at least a day of heavy use per charge. And of course it supports fast charging, to get you powered up and ready to rock in no time at all. We're yet to test the Pixel phone's battery life, but early word is that the Pixel can keep going for even longer. Fast charging is again supported, while both handsets use Type-C USB for power and data transfer. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Cameras When we get our review sample of the Pixel phone we'll be thoroughly testing the 12-megapixel rear camera, but in our hands-on tests it certainly seems to be a worthy flagship snapper. You can take rapid-fire shots and there's zero shutter lag, just like on the iPhone 7's excellent camera. Just tap and your photo takes instantly. Our test photos were pleasingly detailed, although unlikely to beat the Xperia XZ's output. Sony's 23-megapixel camera really impresses with its sharp, attractive images, and the XZ's new triple-sensor tech works well in low-light conditions. Check out our in-depth Xperia XZ camera review for full samples and more. Both of these phones can capture up to 4K resolution video, with strong image stabilisation to cut down on shakes and judders. If you shoot a lot of home movies, you don't need to lean towards one phone or the other. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Price and verdict When it comes to cost, the Xperia XZ and Google Pixel phone both pack a premium price. However, it's possible to pick up the Xperia XZ on contract for less cash than the Pixel, and in terms of specs and features there's not a massive gap between them. You can grab the Sony Xperia XZ from O2, from £37 per month with no up-front cost. Check out our round-up of the best Pixel phone UK deals. Stay tuned for our full Google Pixel phone review.

On the bright side, Google will deliver the monthly Android security updates itself.  ( Verizon Wireless ) Advertisement Surprise! Buying a Google Pixel smartphone from Verizon Wireless means that Big Red has final say when it comes to delivering Android updates. Those who purchase a new Google Pixel smartphone unlocked from the Google Store will get their future Android updates straight from Google, just how it worked with Nexus devices. The Verizon Pixel models, however, are carrier versions and updates are left to the carrier. It's worth mentioning that the same applies to Verizon Pixel smartphones purchase from Best Buy, since the retailer is not carrying the unlocked versions of the handsets. Google itself has confirmed to 9to5Google that Verizon will be responsible for delivering future Android updates to the Google Pixel smartphones that it sells. This means that it will likely take a while for future updates to hit the devices. Any intermediary between Google and Google device users typically results in delays, and carriers conduct their own testing processes before delivering updates. Verizon, for its part, is notorious for delivering updates late, which means that Google Pixel owners may not get the latest updates as soon as they're available. On the bright side, Google retains control of security. The company will be in charge of delivering the monthly Android security updates directly to its smartphones, be they Verizon versions or unlocked models. Meanwhile, those who would like to avoid Android update delays might want to consider purchasing a Google Pixel or Pixel XL directly from the Google Store. They're fully compatible with Verizon's network and might save you some headaches down the line, when new updates hit the scene. As a bonus, Pixel smartphones purchased from Google will not come with Verizon's own bloatware preinstalled - and Big Red tends to stuff its devices full of preloaded applications. That may not change the fact that most people prefer to buy smartphones from carriers, but at least it serves as a heads-up. Verizon is the exclusive carrier partner for the Google Pixel smartphones, but interested customers can always opt for the unlocked version instead. If you're not sure which Google Pixel smartphone might be the right fit for you, check out our Google Pixel vs. Pixel XL comparison. The two smartphones will officially go on sale in November, but both are already available for preorder. To further sweeten the deal, both the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL come with a free Daydream VR headset, as they're the first smartphones to be Daydream-ready.

X Cantillon: Meet Hal, your 21st-century personal assistant Smart home devices from Google and Amazon requires users to sacrifice a lot of privacy Sat, Oct 8, 2016, 05:29 2001: A Space Odyssey – either science fiction, or an uncannily prescient look at AI-powered devices that know far more about us than they should         For anyone old enough to remember 2001: A Space Odyssey, now might be the time to reconsider moving to that cabin in the woods, with no phone connection or electricity. Because your home is about to become almost sentient, thanks to the combined efforts of Google and Amazon. We’re about to throw open the doors of our homes to devices that can control everything around us, and we don’t seem to be that concerned about the power it gives away. Both companies now offer voice-controlled speakers that can take control over the basic smart home functions. But Google has the potential to make it just a little creepier. We’ll give the firm the benefit of the doubt. We’re sure it’s not the company’s intention to know a scary amount of detail about its users’ lives. But it does. Where you live, where you work, what your voice sounds like. What spam lists you’ve been signed up to. Every place you’ve asked for directions to since you started signing in to Google maps. And now, add Google Home to the mix. Google Home uses artifical intelligence – Google Assistant – to learn about users: what they like and dislike, what they need at different types of the day. It could either be the best friend you’ll ever have, or a slightly creepy, stalkerish device that knows far more about you than it should. But this isn’t just about Google Home; it’s merely the latest in a long line of products that are designed to make our homes smarter by connecting them to the internet. It’s all part of the internet of things, the march towards connecting devices online in a bid to make them more useful, more convenient and take a lot of the dull, repetitive work away from humans. It all sounds like a great idea. But it’s not as simple as that. There’s a sinister side to the internet of things. Take the recent attack on security writer Brian Krebs’ website. It was the biggest DDOS attack ever recorded, with the attackers using a web of IoT devices to carry it out. A report on the incident blamed security cameras and DVRs with basic passwords for the attack. ADVERTISEMENT Basic passwords, in this instance, meant ones that were never changed from the easily guessed default, or were something simple like “password” or “admin”. At the end of the day, the smart home and all its devices is only as smart as the person using it. The weak link in the chain is the human element – and that’s one that we may not be able to fix for the forseeable future.       Topics: Cantillon Brian Krebs Amazon Google AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Secondary Menu Home About Categories bbPress Blogging BuddyPress Events ICYMI News Plugins Polls Themes WordPress Weekly WordPress Contributors Podcast Comment Policy Contact Us Search for: Home News WordPress.com Adds Customization for AMP Pages, Pushes Update to AMP Plugin WordPress.com Adds Customization for AMP Pages, Pushes Update to AMP Plugin Sarah Gooding October 7, 2016 4 When Google first launched AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages), its open source initiative to speed up the mobile web, the project focused on getting publishers on board. AMP pages were featured in the “Top Stories” carousel and soon adoption of AMP grew beyond news publishers to other industries such as e-commerce, recipe sites, and local listings. Ebay has AMP’d up 15 million product category pages, Pinterest is getting ready to roll out AMP support for pins, and Reddit is also serving AMP pages. At the end of Septemeber Google announced that it has added AMP indicators to mobile search results. Users can now easily tell which results will load faster than others by looking for the AMP lightning bolt icon. The pressure is on for website owners to make their sites AMP-ready. Google said that AMP results are not yet prioritized over others, but page speed is factored into results. The search engine’s benchmarks demonstrate that AMP results provide a much faster experience for mobile users than pages that have not been optimized according to AMP specifications: Today, the median time it takes for an AMP page to load from Google Search is less than one second. Beyond just saving you time with fast loading pages, AMP will also save you data — AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. In response with Google AMPing up mobile search results, WordPress.com has pushed out a major update to its support for AMP pages. According to Automattic representative Mark Armstrong, AMP pages have been “automatically turned on for every WordPress.com site and a sizable number of VIP publishers also turned it on manually.” This means that tens of millions of sites are now, according to Automattic’s tests, “up to 89% faster than normal faster” when reached via mobile search. The update also gives WordPress.com users the ability to customize the design for AMP pages using live preview in the Customizer. Users can select between a light and dark color screen and use a color-picker to select header text and link colors. Automattic’s AMP plugin for self-hosted WordPress users has been updated to include support for tweaking the AMP template in the Customizer by navigating to Appearance > AMP. The plugin, which has more than 90,000 active installs, had not been updated for the past two months until today. During that time it accumulated many negative reviews due to lack of customizability, bugs, and no support for pages. Several users have reported that Google sent them a notification saying the AMP pages automatically created by the plugin are not compliant. The AMP plugin’s changelog details the changes in 0.4, which include support for inline styles, a fix for broken YouTube URLs, no more fatal errors when tags are not supported by post type, and handful of other improvements. The release also introduces a new filter amp_pre_get_permalink for creating a custom AMP permalink. Pages are still not supported, but the plugin’s FAQ tab indicates that Automattic is working on it.

In a move that truly highlights the death of the Nexus program, system updates for the Pixel phones will be managed by Verizon for models that it sells, while Google will handle updates for unlocked models purchased through the Google Store. Phones bought at Best Buy are Verizon models, so they will be subject to Verizon's update schedule too. With Nexus devices, Google controlled the delivery of software updates, whether it was sold by a carrier or not. This ensured that anyone who purchased a Nexus device was treated to fast software updates when a new version of Android was released. However, with Verizon controlling updates for its Pixel phones, the carrier will almost certainly delay the rollout of updates to ensure their bloatware is fully compatible. On a positive note, Google will still push monthly security updates to the Pixel and Pixel XL outside of Verizon's control, ensuring users have a secure device at all times. Verizon only has control over system updates, such as a potential future update to Android 8.0 when it's announced and released. For those that want a Pixel phone on Verizon and don't want to deal with the carrier's slow updates and bloatware, the models Google are selling through the Google Store are fully compatible with the Verizon network. It's possible to simply buy the handset from Google, rather than Verizon, and enjoy a Nexus-like software experience.

Now Google is diversifying, spreading out into every aspect of our lives. The tech conglomerate has been powering smartphones, driverless cars, and even homes. This year, though, the search giant made a huge move, laying to rest the Nexus name and introducing their own phones: the Pixel and Pixel XL. While these were the stars of Google’s reveal, the real star is the one you didn’t know you saw. It’s the Google Assistant, an AI that’s right there on your phone. In the months leading up to the launch, a normal Google search of the Pixel and Pixel XL yielded hundreds of leaks. We knew what was coming, and how it looked, so there was no surprise there. However, it’s been an entirely different feeling to look at the actual finished product. Let’s take a closer look at the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. What’s Outside The Pixel and its bigger brother, Pixel XL, are beautifully designed with an aerospace-grade aluminium unibody. What makes them stand out from all other phones is a glass section at the back with the fingerprint sensor, giving the phone a lot of personality. The Pixel has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch Quad HD (four times the definition of standard display) AMOLED display, with a 100 per cent NTSC colour gamut and true black levels. The glass on the front of the display is 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The phone comes in what Google clearly means to be a jibe at the iPhone colour variant names — Quite Black and Very White colours, along with a special edition Really Blue, which, incidentally, is already sold out. The front of the phone sports an array of sensors that are unsightly, especially on the white phone. So the Quite Black is what you should be going for if you don’t like seeing those sensors. The bezels are decent on the sides, not too small, not too big. However, the ‘chin’ of the phone is quite big; a space which would normally have been used for hardware buttons or a fingerprint sensor, or even stereo speakers, is now empty real estate. In another dig at rival Apple, Google showed off their inclusion of the headphone jack. The Cameras Yes, this is the only part of a smartphone anyone ever cares about nowadays, and with good measure. Smartphone manufacturers have realised the importance of a good camera and are racing to build the best. However, Google seems to have beaten both Apple and Samsung to the click, by claiming that the Pixel has the best camera to date. According to DXOMark, a site that reviews and rates camera tech, the Pixel has scored the highest among smartphones with 89 points. But we will know for sure in the next few days, when the user reviews start pouring in. For now, let’s see the specs. The rear camera is a 12.3-megapixel shooter with large 1.55 micron pixels that capture more light, resulting in a better picture. The F2.0 aperture lets in more light with a phase and laser detection autofocus. This camera can record a full HD video at 60 fps (frames per second) and slow motion at 120 fps, 4K video at 30 fps, and very slowmo video at 240 fps at a slightly lower 720p. Google has mentioned that its camera software is bristling with algorithms that help get you the best picture. You can even hold the shutter button down to burst shoot, and the phone will help you select the best shot and save it in the album. The front camera is an eight-megapixel, fixed-focus shooter, also with large 1.4 micron pixels. This allows you to take great selfies — again using Google’s camera app — with a load of enhancements. While both shooters may take excellent pictures, they will take up a lot of space on your phone. Especially considering that there’s no SD Card support. Google did reveal, though, that every Pixel user will get free unlimited storage on the cloud for all their photos and videos, no matter the resolution or file size. What’s Inside The Pixel and Pixel XL both sport the latest Snapdragon 821 processors. Storage comes in between 32GB to 128GB, non-expandable, so you’ll be glad there’s free unlimited photo and video storage. To keep things running smooth, there’s a 4GB LPDDR4 RAM. The phone comes with a USB Type-C connector and a large 2770mAh battery for the Pixel, and an even larger 3450mAh battery for the Pixel XL. According to Google, you can get seven hours of use with just a quick 15 minutes of charging. The Price This is where the catch comes in. Google has confirmed the Pixel’s price to be Rs. 57,000 for the 32GB variant and Rs. 66,000 for the 128GB variant. The Pixel XL starts at Rs. 67,000 for the 32GB variant and Rs. 76,000 for the 128GB variant. The prices are almost at the iPhone 7 level for specs that are around the area of the OnePlus 3, which will set you back Rs. 27,999. Though it seems that the Pixels are packing a little bit more than just stock Android. Google Assistant We’ve always dreamed of robots and other forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping us live better. Science fiction has always portrayed them as destroyers of life thanks to movies like Terminator, and worse yet, AI can go crazy as seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Avengers: Age of Ultron. The best examples of good AI would be those in Interstellar, which are true buddies to man in every respect. We are years away from that kind of tech, but the first step towards that reality is the Pixel. Meet Google Assistant, a friendly AI that uses conversational English to help you with whatever you need. Google actually understands and responds accordingly, to context like “should I wear sunglasses today”, in response to which the Assistant shows you the weather. Should you ask about tomorrow, the Assistant already knows what you’re referring to and will show you what the next day looks like. The Assistant was also shown taking notes and reminders when simply asked to remember something. You can also get it to bring up images from an earlier date or translate for you. Why is this so important? The easiest form of interaction is with speech. With any other smartphone, you’d have to manually look for a particular image, physically type out a note or have a translation app. With the Assistant, you can constantly ask it to keep track of your life. This paves the way for a completely voice-activated future. Google Chromecast Ultra Google’s little streaming device has gained quite a lot of ground all over the world. It converts any screen into a Smart TV easily and lets you stream movies. With 4K and HDR gaining ground, the Chromecast Ultra makes that upgrade to a TV with both features seem a lot more appealing. Essentially, 4K is very high fidelity content while HDRs (High Dynamic Range) are better types of screens with better display technology to give you very lifelike quality with amazing contrast ratio. These two technologies are the biggest reasons to upgrade to a 4K/HDR TV. Google Daydream VR Interestingly, Google was the first to unveil a true virtual reality device, which was made of cardboard and aptly called Cardboard. It was the perfect VR solution since you only needed a good smartphone and a Cardboard unit you could practically make yourself. Now, Google has introduced Daydream VR, a lightweight fabric VR device that holds your smartphone screen at a distance from your eyes. It also packs in a tiny controller unit so you can adjust your experience. Just be careful not to bump your knees into a table, or fall off a balcony. Google home Also unveiled at Google’s press event was a voice-controlled speaker called Google Home. Essentially, this uses the power of Google Assistant to control aspects of your home. The Assistant is always there to answer several of your queries and pipe reminders about flights and other time-bound activities.

But according to the state of voice search, we won’t have to wait until the year 2364 to get there. Voice search is the fastest growing type of search, according to the keynote speech given by Behshad Behzadi at SMX West in March, Principal Engineer at Google Zurich. Already, 55% of teens and 41% of adults use voice search on a daily basis, and that number is only growing. The allure of voice chat is undeniable—it’s faster, it’s hands-free, it lets you multi-task, and (especially among millennials) it’s considered cool. Voice chat is also becoming increasingly reliable as technology improves. In fact, two years ago word error rate was over 20%, but current speech recognition word error rate is as low as 8%—a huge leap in a short amount of time. And now, according to Behshad, conversational search is the future. Not just voice recognition, but voice understanding—search that responds to natural phrases by interpreting the meaning and context behind the words used. Google’s aim is to transform voice search into “an ultimate mobile assistant that helps you with your daily life, so you can focus on the things that matter.” Search Smarter Than Ever Before Very few people type the way they speak, especially when it comes to search queries. When you type, you adopt a sort of stilted shorthand, so you enter something like “weather Paris” into your search bar. When you speak, you’re more likely to ask the complete question, “What’s the weather like in Paris?” This pattern holds true with voice search queries as well. As programs like Google Now, Siri, and Cortana become more popular, and their programming becomes more refined, it’s increasingly important that search engines learn to interpret natural phrases. To that end, Google’s been trying to adopt speech quirks and idiosyncrasies into its voice search programming. And they’ve been busy. Voice search is now capable of interpreting and responding to: 1. Spelling Corrections/Queries If you ask Google to show you a picture of Wales, and you get back a picture of whales, you can then clarify, “W-A-L-E-S,” and a picture of the country will now pop up. 2. What’s Been Previously Said/Searched For If you ask “Where is the Golden Gate Bridge” and follow that up with the queries “I want to see pictures of it” and “who built it,” Google is able to interpret what “it” is based on your initial search, delivering pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge and an answer on who built it. Alternatively, if Google cannot immediately answer a query, you can help it narrow down the answer through context. So, if you ask “How high is Rigi,” voice search may not respond, because it’s an obscure mountain in the Swiss Alps. But if you ask, “What are the mountains in Switzerland” first, and follow that up with the query “How high is Rigi,” Google will tell you that it’s 1,798 m in elevation. 3. Context Based on Location If you’re at a Convention Center in San Jose and you ask voice search, “How far is the airport from the Convention Center?” Google will understand that “the Convention Center” refers to your current location in San Jose. 4. App-Based Context If you’re chatting about a specific restaurant in an app like Viber, you can ask Google to “Show me the menu.” Google will understand which restaurant’s menu you want to see based on context, and bring up a menu for that restaurant. 5. Context of What You See On-screen Looking up a Wikipedia entry on Johnny Depp? You can ask voice search to “Show me pictures of Johnny,” and get back a smorgasbord of Johnny Depp photos, because he’s the “Johnny” you currently have on screen. 6. Context About You Asking Google “What’s my office address?” will bring up your office address, without the need to clarify who “my” refers to. But that’s not all! There are also hints that Google is working on conversational shopping. It’s not hard to imagine how this could lend itself to making instant purchases, asking voice search to “Order me a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza from Pizza Hut” or “Show me blue jeans / Show me size 12 / Order me the pair from American Eagle.” The Death of Short Tail Keywords? It’s clear that context and conversational search are only to become more important as voice search continues to evolve. So where does that leave SEO? Well, for one thing, we need to seriously incorporate voice search strategy into our websites, because voice search optimization is the future of SEO. That means doubling down on excellent content, written in a conversational tone. We also need to understand that people who type a query and people who ask a question into voice search are often after two different things entirely. For example, the typer might be okay with doing research, while the talker typically wants quick answers and instant results. We need to appeal to both types of people. When it comes to optimization strategies, you should: 1. Focus on Long Tail Keywords While I don’t believe that short tail keywords will ever disappear entirely, they do become far less relevant when we consider the natural phrases used in voice searches. We need to focus more attention than ever on conversational, long tail keywords. 2. Provide Context with Schema Markup Get acquainted with schema markup, if you’re not already. This HTML add-on helps search engines understand the context of your content, which means you rank better in normal searches, and you’ll be more relevant in specific queries made through voice search. 3. Optimize Your Site’s Microdata Make sure things like directions to brick and mortar locations and XML Sitemaps are readable to visitors and search engines on your website. This is the kind of information mobile users and voice searchers will most often be after. 4. Add Pages That Answer FAQs When voice searchers as a question, they typically begin it with “Who,” “What,” “Where,” “When,” “Why,” and “How,” and they’re looking for answers that fulfill an immediate need. To answer these queries, make a FAQs page and begin each question with these adverbs. Then answer them conversationally to appeal to voice search. 5. Do Keyword Research on Conversational Queries Keyword research tools like Rank Tracker (disclaimer: my tool) will let you autocomplete queries using a keyword and a wildcard. Base the questions on the FAQs described above and look for commonly searched long tail keywords to figure out what questions you should be answering. Where We Go From Here I think a lot of us who grew up in an age where technology couldn’t talk back still have a certain stigma attached to talking to our phones when another human being isn’t on the other end. But, according to Google, younger generations don’t have that same hesitation, and most “feel tech savvy” asking questions into voice search. They ask it for directions. They use it to call someone. It even helps them with their homework. And yes, they even use it in the company of others. Voice search is clearly on the rise and we’d be foolish to ignore this trend in the SEO industry. It’s time to stop thinking linearly about only text-based queries, and start talking about how we can optimize for voice searches as well. Clearly, the future is conversational.   Image Credits Featured image: Alexander Supertramp/Shutterstock.com In-post Photo: Ollyy / Shutterstock.com Related Posts These 7 New AdWords Tools and Features Will Change Your Campaigns Forever 20 Ways Google Glass Will Change Pro Sports Forever Voice Search SEO: Is Hands Free Search a Hands Down Winner?

Great article must say.. (y) Palash Kumar Daw Thank’s Trifon Boyukliyski google voice search features Caroline Wabara Great insights! Got to know the power of voice search when my 8 year old son prefers speaking rather than typing the words. Feuza Reis love the post as last year I began noticing my young kids using voice search and how the future of search will be long tail keywords but what I did not realize is how action based queries will be and future will be instead of pizza near me, will be order me a small pie etc, and how different the typer is vs the one using voice results- love that part Aleh Barysevich Agree – we’re stepping into an exciting stage of optimizing for voice search, along with all the other traditional aspects of SEO. Site owners will need to better understand how people reference their business when speaking, the exact words they’re likely to use. In addition, to win in voice search, sites will need to be fast and mobile-friendly. Feuza Reis yes they will be and future is intriguing Anthony Trollope Rather astounding stats. 8% error rate doesn’t seem to match my personal experiences. I tend to get quite frustrated with it. Admittedly I’m not compared Apples with Apples, as I mostly use Siri which one assumes is not as proficient as Google Voice Search. Aleh Barysevich I know, 8% error rate in speech recognition sounds like a huge improvement to what we’re used to. The stats were announced by a Google representative at a conference back in March, so it’s quite recent and based on their latest technology improvements. Google Voice Search should indeed be more superior to Siri. Dhivya Subramanian Thanks for sharing optimization strategy……how u made this ?

Great article must say.. (y) Palash Kumar Daw Thank’s Trifon Boyukliyski google voice search features Caroline Wabara Great insights! Got to know the power of voice search when my 8 year old son prefers speaking rather than typing the words. Feuza Reis love the post as last year I began noticing my young kids using voice search and how the future of search will be long tail keywords but what I did not realize is how action based queries will be and future will be instead of pizza near me, will be order me a small pie etc, and how different the typer is vs the one using voice results- love that part Aleh Barysevich Agree – we’re stepping into an exciting stage of optimizing for voice search, along with all the other traditional aspects of SEO. Site owners will need to better understand how people reference their business when speaking, the exact words they’re likely to use. In addition, to win in voice search, sites will need to be fast and mobile-friendly. Feuza Reis yes they will be and future is intriguing Anthony Trollope Rather astounding stats. 8% error rate doesn’t seem to match my personal experiences. I tend to get quite frustrated with it. Admittedly I’m not compared Apples with Apples, as I mostly use Siri which one assumes is not as proficient as Google Voice Search. Aleh Barysevich I know, 8% error rate in speech recognition sounds like a huge improvement to what we’re used to. The stats were announced by a Google representative at a conference back in March, so it’s quite recent and based on their latest technology improvements. Google Voice Search should indeed be more superior to Siri. Dhivya Subramanian Thanks for sharing optimization strategy……how u made this ?
