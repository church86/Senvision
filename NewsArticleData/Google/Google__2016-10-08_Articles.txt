 Google and Facebook are destined to wage a decade-long war for the future Matt Weinberger Oct. 9, 2016, 3:41 PM 23,286 facebook linkedin twitter email print Back in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his grand ten-year roadmap, showing the company's trajectory from now through 2026.  Here's that slide again, in case you missed it: Facebook It points the way to Facebook's ideal future: A world where everybody's connected to the internet, where we talk to artificially intelligent computers as if they were human, and — boldest of all —  where virtual reality goggles are as common as our smartphones, allowing us to connect with people across the world as intimately as if they were in the same room. Facebook moved the marker on this ambitious roadmap a little bit forward this week, with more details on how the social network will operate in its ideal virtual reality future. In a demo, Zuckerberg showed off "Social VR," using a combination of the Oculus Rift headset and a 360-degree camera to mash together virtual reality and the real world like never before. In Facebook's vision for the year 2026, the social network plays a key role in more, if not most, of the interactions you have with your fellow humans. It's a little creepy, given how much Facebook already permeates our personal lives, but it provides a fascinating glimpse of the radical changes coming to the technology we use.   Mark Zuckerberg takes a "modern family" selfie with his VR avatar, his wife Priscilla video chatting in on Messenger, and his dog Beast as shown on a 360-degree camera. Facebook/Mark Zuckerberg That's not to say it will be easy for Facebook.  Just this week, Google held its own big event. And while that presentation was ostensibly to introduce new hardware, it also gave us a glimpse of how Google is thinking about its own future — and the ways in which Facebook's 10-year strategy overlap with Google's. Their core businesses couldn't be more different — Facebook's efforts to break into search haven't yielded much result; Google's attempts to become a social network are pretty much Silicon Valley punchlines at this point. Yet in many important ways, Facebook and Google are already going punch-for-punch in a fight that won't be over any time soon. Fighting from the sidelines The most visible part of their fight: Google's YouTube is the undisputed ruler for web video. But Facebook has been working hard at undermining YouTube's supremacy by attracting more media brands and advertisers to its video offerings. But the more interesting competition is in the futuristic and far-reaching technology being developed by each tech giant.  Just this past week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is using artificial intelligence to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Facebook is investing heavily in AI to personalize its news feed, too. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Reuters/Stephen Lam Facebook's Oculus subsidiary may have sparked the sudden gold rush towards virtual reality, but Google isn't far behind with its Daydream View headset, also announced this week. With VR movies projected to be big business, Google doesn't want to let Facebook steal YouTube's lead in video advertising. Google's parent company Alphabet and Facebook are both making huge investments in connecting the world. Facebook is using self-piloting laser drones, and Google is using balloons, but they share a self-given mission of connecting underserved populations to the internet.  Alphabet's Project Loon delivers internet to underserved areas via a balloon suspended at a suborbital altitude. The Verge/Google X On all counts, these are very future-looking businesses. Artificial intelligence is a very young field, and virtual reality is a long ways away from hitting the consumer mainstream. Even those efforts to connect the globe have regulatory hurdles to overcome in many countries. It's early enough that these are all sidelines to what each company is really good at. But with a long enough timespan — say, 10 years — there are going to be winners in each field, and there are going to be losers. And each side is stockpiling as much engineering talent as it can to make sure that they're the ones who walk away from this. Daydream believer Ultimately, what this all comes down to is growth amid great technological change. Google and Facebook, both born in the weird period between the bursting of the first dot-com bubble and Silicon Valley's current startup boom, successfully navigated the transition from the PC to the smartphone. The way Google managed that change was largely thanks to Android itself: A smartphone operating system that had Google search and services baked in at every possible level, while also available on a whole range of low- and high-end phones for every possible demographic. Now, Android is the most popular operating system in the world, and Google profits. Mark Zuckerberg shows off Facebook's ultimate vision for what virtual reality glasses will look like by 2026. Facebook Facebook was slow transitioning from the PC to the smartphone, but quickly caught up and now sees the majority of its users and ad revenue on mobile.  But with the smartphone boom now grinding to a halt, the established businesses of the past decade are due for a shakeup and the hunt is on for the next big thing. Whatever it turns out to be — virtual reality, AI-powered assistants, or the like — Google and Facebook are both vying to repeat the Android trick and become indispensable to the next phase of technology. This isn't a battle that will be won with one product release, one new website design, or one app. It's a war that will be fought in fits and spurts in the years to come. But for the winner comes control over the future.  SEE ALSO: Google couldn't stop copying Apple, Amazon, and Facebook even if it wanted to NOW WATCH: Google’s new VR headset is ‘squishy and very comfortable’ — here’s what it’s like Loading video...

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 33 photos of Google's rise from a Stanford dorm room to world domination Matt Weinberger Oct. 9, 2016, 10:21 AM 632,509 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.RANDI LYNN BEACH / AP Images Google is a global superpower.  Not only is Google the most-visited website in the world — it also makes Google Android, the most popular operating system in the world.  And on the back of Google's incredibly profitable advertising business, its parent company Alphabet is worth $543.3 billion. But it wasn't always that way. Here's a look at the history of Google, from its roots in a pair of Stanford dorm rooms, to Larry Page and Sergey Brin's attempt to sell the company, all the way through the explosive announcement that Google was becoming Alphabet. View As: One Page Slides Google got its start in 1996, when two Stanford PhD students named Sergey Brin (left) and Larry Page (right) had the idea for "BackRub," a revolutionary search engine that used a technology called "PageRank" that would rank web pages based on how many other web pages linked back to them. Bloomberg Game Changers Page and Brin's first office was actually their two Stanford dorm rooms. The "BackRub" name didn't last long, as they decided that a "googol," or the number one with a hundred zeroes after it, better reflected the amount of data they were trying to sift through. The slightly friendlier name "Google" was chosen for the fledgling company. Google The first-ever Google server was built in a custom case made out of Legos and housed on the Stanford campus. At first, it was just at google.stanford.edu, but the Google.com domain name was registered on September 15th, 1997. Wikimedia Commons Eventually, Google drained too much of Stanford's bandwidth, and the IT department kicked them out. Page and Brin relocated the fledgling company in the garage of future Google employee and YouTube head Susan Wojcicki. MARCIO JOSE SANCHEZ / AP Images Around the same time they moved into the garage, Brin and Page got a crucial $100,000 seed investment from Sun Microsystems founder Andy Bechtolsheim. With funding in hand, Google officially incorporated in their garage headquarters on September 4th, 1998. Wikimedia Commons Google's first homepage was not much of a looker. Neither Page nor Brin had much expertise with the website programming language HTML, choosing to focus their efforts on the algorithms that made it run. Google At one point in 1999, Google was almost acquired by Excite, a leading search engine at the time. Excite would have acquired Google for $750,000 in cash, Excite's then CEO George Bell has said. But the the deal fell through for reasons that are still debated, and Google continued on its own. OneWire Page and Brin decided to make it a business, after all. In March of 1999, Google moved into its first-ever office at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto — the same office building that housed companies like PayPal and Logitech. Google Not long after, Google raised its first round of venture capital funding in the form of a $25 million investment from Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers and Sequoia Capital. That probably bought its developers a lot more beer. Google Google debuted its AdWords product in late 2000, enabling businesses to buy ads related to search terms. By this point, Google was already rising in popularity as a search engine, so it had a steady revenue stream that kept it going through the dot-com burst that claimed so many startups. A Google ad for its AdWords service. Google's star was definitely on the rise, and Brin and Page were becoming rock stars in the tech community for succeeding where everybody else failed. RANDI LYNN BEACH / AP Images Around the time it started making money in 2000, Google adopted its famous, but unofficial, corporate philosophy: "Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains." Tangi Bertin/Flickr At investor Sequoia's urging, Brin and Page brought on Eric Schmidt as the company's first CEO in 2001, leaving the founders free to focus on Google's technology. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters By this point, the Google team was growing out of its Palo Alto offices. So in 2003, Google leased its now-famous Googleplex campus from ailing, old-school tech giant Silicon Graphics International. By 2006, Google was able to buy the Googleplex outright. Google The Googleplex became a symbol of Silicon Valley success. Google worked hard to make it a little more whimsical than your average campus. The original main campus building is well-known for having a slide that connects the first two floors.

Flickr/Dmitry Alekseenko It also has a famous dinosaur statue often covered in flamingos. Google employee rumor holds that it's a reminder to its employees to not go extinct. OpenBuildings On August 19th, 2004, Google had its initial public offering on the stock market, priced at $85 per share. Today, a share in Google parent company Alphabet costs over $800. Getty Images On April 1st, 2004, Google announced a private beta for Gmail, an e-mail service. Because it was on April Fool's Day, the media and users all thought it was a prank at first. Biz Stone In fact, after the IPO, Google set its sights on expanding past the search engine. Google started gobbling up startups to launch new products like Google Docs and Google Maps, which are still around today. Flickr / Sancho McCann In 2005, Google bought a tiny startup that was making an operating system for digital cameras. It was called Android and was led by Andy Rubin. AP 2006 also saw Google buy up YouTube, a brand-new video-sharing site that was founded by a bunch of ex-PayPal employees. Google paid $1.65 billion in stock for YouTube. YouTube Google was getting bigger and bigger. In 2006, Google opened up its first wholly-owned and designed data center in The Dalles, Oregon, on the banks of the Columbia river. Google Google has a history of squeezing out incredibly high levels of efficiency from its data centers with inventive new designs — a history that started at that first Oregon site. Google Google was so popular by this point that "Googling" had become an acceptable word for "searching the Internet." In June of 2006, the verb "google" was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-Webster Dictionary In 2008, the HTC Dream hit the market. It was the first-ever Android smartphone that consumers could buy. Today, Google Android is the most popular operating system on the planet. Wikimedia The year 2008 also saw Google introduce Google Chrome, a web browser that integrated tightly with Google's growing roster of web services. Google wanted to make sure that on every device, you keep using Google — and looking at Google ads. Google In 2011, Schmidt stepped down as Google CEO, though he kept his title as executive chairman, and stuck around to advise Page and Brin. Larry Page became the new CEO of Google. Flickr / loiclemur With its dominance in search all but locked down, the last few years have seen Page's Google focus on some crazy, next-generation ideas. In 2010, Google announced that it was working on driverless cars that didn't require a human to operate. Google In 2012, Google announced Google Glass, a wearable computer that would present information in your field of vision. It didn't catch on the way people hoped, but it made an impact on the world. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images In fact, Google operates secret labs that are working on all kinds of nifty projects. This contact lens can measure the glucose level in the blood of diabetics. Google Much more recently, Google shocked the world by completely shaking up its corporate structure. Brin, Page, and Schmidt turned Google into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company. Larry Page became the CEO of Alphabet. AP Photo/Seth Wenig This leaves former Google Chrome head Sundar Pichai in charge of the whole company, guiding the future of the newly-formed Alphabet's most important and profitable businesses. Under Pichai, Google has made big moves into artificial intelligence. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. Four years and one embarrassment later, Apple Maps is genuinely worthy of challenging Google Maps Jeff Dunn Oct. 9, 2016, 10:30 AM 99,289 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Apple Maps, by all accounts, was a disaster. When it tried to displace the reliable and ubiquitous Google Maps in iOS 6, it quickly turned into a punchline — inaccurate, buggy, and wholly undercooked. It was enough of a trainwreck that Apple CEO Tim Cook had to publicly apologize for how terrible it was, a nigh unprecedented move in Apple land. To the company’s credit, though, it’s steadily cleaned up that mess. Most iPhone owners are comfortable using it. Still, that’s largely because it’s the default — Google Maps still garners millions of downloads on iOS, is still used by many more people worldwide, and is generally seen as the superior product. Today, it’s hard to say that’s changed. But with its latest refresh in iOS 10, Apple Maps is finally at a point where you can ignore Google and not totally feel like you’re missing out. It’s a robust, convenient, and delightful little app. If you’ve just picked up a new iPhone, here’s why it’s worth keeping on your home screen. View As: One Page Slides First and foremost, Apple Maps is polished. It looks good. The map is bright and colorful, but not so vivid as to be distracting. Text is crisp, but not overly edgy. Landmarks are clearly delineated, and highlighted locations are neatly color coded. You know what you’re looking at when you see it. It’s pleasant on a core, visual level. That’s especially important for a mapping app, as frustration is the last thing you want when you’re lost. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn It runs smoothly, too. I’d expect as much from a first-party app running on first-party hardware, but Maps is quick on my iPhone SE. When you search, results spring onto the screen with little delay. When you zoom, new icons load fluidly enough to feel natural. When you first open the app, it takes seconds to pinpoint where you are. It’s not always immediate, but generally speaking, performance is a strength. The "Flyover" mode is still there.Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Crucially, it’s also accurate. I didn’t travel the world to bring you this review, but at least in New York City and eastern New Jersey, I never felt like Maps was sending me in a roundabout or misleading direction. As my routes changed, it was quick to update itself over an LTE connection. I can’t say it’s as automatic as Google Maps, but it’s comfortably reliable. You enter a destination; it tells you how to get there. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Apple Maps’ design is smart. At almost any given time, you see all the essential mapping info, with the search bar in a swipeable card just below it. If you need to dig deeper, you just swipe that card up. This’ll change based on what you’re looking into. It could be something as simple as alternate routes… Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Or, if you click on a landmark like Manhattan’s Flatiron Building, some background info from Wikipedia... Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Or some sample reviews from Yelp. This is particularly handy if you’re considering an unfamiliar restaurant, hotel, and the like. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Swipe up on a commuter station, meanwhile, and you’ll see supported transit lines, arrival times, and any delays. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn In almost any case, you’ll find basic contact info, photos, and shortcuts for adding a place to your contact lists. (You'll also see if a place supports Apple Pay, naturally.) If it’s a spot you’ll want to visit again, you can also add it to your list of “Favorites.” Do that, and Maps will subtly highlight it on the map itself, and suggest it in search. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn That search is useful. After I gave the app my home address, for example, it’d list that as my top search suggestion anytime I was out of the house. It shows expected arrival time and traffic delays, too. With two taps, I can get turn-by-turn directions home — i.e., the place I’m most frequently going. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Those thoughtful little touches are all over the place. When you scroll to different locations, the little weather icon in the bottom right corner changes to reflect that area. When you’re setting up a long drive, you’ll see all the tolls along the way. A distance scale pops up whenever you zoom in. There’s a compass. The big, green “GO” button you tap to start the turn-by-turn navigation mode is impossible to miss. And so on. Note the weather icon.Business Insider/Jeff Dunn You see those easily visible, easily pressable icons in search, too. The second you tap on the text entry box, you get this octet of location types. Press one, and you get subcategories within that. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn If you want something “Fun,” you tap that to see this submenu of “Movies,” “Sports,” “Nightlife” (i.e., bars and clubs), and so forth. If you pick Movies, all the nearby movie theaters sprout onscreen. It’s cute. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Alternatively, I could just search for "movie theaters” (or “parks,” or “drug stores,” or “laundromats,” or what have you) and things will pop up the same way. You can also search by specific brands — e.g., “Starbucks,” instead of just “coffee shops.” Point being, the app makes it easy to discover new places. It gives you plenty of options, and looks clean while doing so. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Let’s go back to navigation. When you need directions to a certain spot, there’s now a “Ride” option next to the usual walking, driving, and transit tabs. That lets you order an Uber or Lyft right from the app. This is a common sense, but no less convenient, choice to have. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Beyond Uber and Lyft, you can also use an OpenTable button to make reservations at certain restaurants. (Though, for now, you still have to finish the reservation in the OpenTable app.) This sort of third-party integration feels half-baked today, but it could (could!) be a significant selling point for Maps in the future. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Also new is Maps-specific widgets, which you can access from the lock screen or home screen in iOS 10. There are three in total: Maps Nearby, Maps Destinations, and Maps Transit. The first two are simple enough. Nearby lets you see whatever restaurants, cafes, shops, and gas stations are near you, in a manner similar to the search suggestions above. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Destinations, meanwhile, lets you quickly set a route home, to work, or to any other location you’ve marked as a frequented spot. Like Nearby, it takes a process you'd often do in the app to begin with, and makes it faster. That's nice. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Since I work in New York City, Transit is by far the most helpful of the three widgets for me. It’s convoluted to set up — you have to open the app, zoom onto a subway line, tap it, then manually favorite each one you want highlighted — but once you do, it makes it easy to see which of your everyday trains might be delayed. If I’m going to scream internally every morning, it’s nice to know in advance. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Transit as a whole is fine. It takes two taps to set the map to transit mode, which displays each line onscreen. When you zoom on a particular subway station, all its entrance points become highlighted. The actual directions are accurate, and if you want to arrive somewhere by a set time, it’ll recommend a specific route along with an optimal time to leave. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn When you set off on a trip, Maps enters a darker, GPS-like navigation mode. Again, it puts all the essential info in large, bold lettering. And again, it performs just fine. It also highlights any points of upcoming traffic, and (finally) lets you peek further ahead in your route. Apple is playing catch-up here, but things are clean and clear now. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn When you’re in that mode, you can pull up a “Details” icon, which’ll break down your list of directions step by step. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Or you can watch things update in real-time from the lock screen. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn When driving, you can also bring up directions to nearby coffee, gas, and food stops. (With the same hard-to-miss buttons.) Pick one, and Maps will give you a route to that detour without cancelling your “master” route. When you’re done with your pit stop, you just resume from where you are. It'll add the extra time and distance to your overall trip details, too. See the "Resume Route" tab at the top?Business Insider/Jeff Dunn The flashy driving-related feature with iOS 10 is “Find My Car.” Provided you’re able to pair your car with your phone over Bluetooth, that lets Maps remember where you parked, and give you directions back if need be. You can probably see how this might save you a few headaches. Business Insider/Paul Szoldra So, if it wasn’t clear by this point, Apple Maps is a good app. It finally has the fundamentals down pat, and it’s got a bunch of thoughtful features that make getting around less irritating. Still, it hasn't quite conquered Google Maps. Google’s mapping tech is still the standard, and it's had many of Apple's newest features for years. It's still more advanced when it comes to things like indoor mapping, too. The old reliable, Google Maps.Google Maps It’s also everywhere. Apple Maps, meanwhile, is only available as an iOS and macOS app. In true Apple fashion, it's a product designed to lock you into the Apple ecosystem. But mapping is one of those things that should always be accessible. If you dare own a non-Apple device, Maps is immediately less useful. An Android version would be appreciated (and, after Apple Music, not unprecedented). A web app would be even better — but I wouldn’t hold my breath. Google CEO Sundar Pichai.AP Nevertheless, if you’re an Apple loyalist, you don’t have to go out of your way to download Google Maps anymore. After all these years, Apple Maps finally feels like an Apple Product, with all the charm and ease that’s supposed to imply.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are now available in India - we saw lines forming outside Apple stores for the 7pm launch on Friday, showing that there's a fair amount of demand for these handsets in India. The iPhone 7 price starts at Rs. 60,000 and the iPhone 7 Plus starts at Rs. 72,000, but there are still plenty of deals you can go for to get a slightly cheaper phone. Aside from the new iPhone models, the Apple Watch series 2 is now available in India as well, from Rs. 32,000 onwards.Apart from the various e-commerce deals, Airtel and Reliance Jio are also giving special offers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Airtel's infinity plan is offering users 120GB of free 4G data, while Jio's iPhone offer gives users 12 months of free services including 20GB of data per month, and access to Jio services - a total bundle that the company pegs at being worth Rs. 18,000 for the year's use. Airtel has another offer where it is iPhone 7 at Rs. 19,990 and you can check out all the details here. Our own review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be coming soon, but first impressions have been very positive.

Both phones are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels. The two phones also have some software tweaks that are exclusive for now, including early access to things such as Google Assistant and Android 7.1, and some features that will not trickle down, such as free, unlimited backup for pictures and videos.

(Also see: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) Google also announced the launch of the new Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Wifi, and Google Daydream View. Apart from the iPhone, we saw another high profile phone launch in India this week - the Moto Z and Moto Mods. The phone was first launched in June but the global rollout started in September. Now, the phone has launched in India, with a starting price of Rs. 39,999. The cheaper Moto Z Play starts at Rs. 24,999. You'll be able to buy the phones from October 17, along with the Moto Mods - modular components that can dramatically add features to your phone. The Moto Mods connect to your phone via the 16-dot connector interface, and a number of them are going to be available in India. The JBL Soundboost costs Rs. 6,999, the Moto Insta-Share Projector costs Rs. 19,999, the Hasselblad True Zoom costs Rs. 19,999, the Incipio offGRID Power Pack costs Rs. 5,999, the Wood and Ballistic Nylon Motorola Style Shell costs Rs. 1,099, while the Leather Style Shell costs Rs. 1,599. These will all be available with a slight discount if you buy them with the phone. Other launches this week included the Lyf Wind 4S with 4000mAh battery and the Lyf Flame 7S with a 4-inch display. There was also the Asus ZenPad Z10 tablet with a 9.7-inch display and 4G LTE support. The Zen Cinemax Force also launched this week as did the Oppo F1SDiwali Edition that comes with a redesigned rear panel and Diwali theme. The Intex Aqua Strong 5.2 with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage also launched, and the Vivo Y55L with a 5.2-inch display. Sony also launched two premium cameras, the A6500 and Cyber-Shot RX100 V. The week also saw the big online sales coming to an end, with Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon all reporting great sale numbers. Flipkart says customer saved over Rs. 1000 crore during its Big Billion Days Sale, while Amazon registered strong growth in mobile shoppers and Prime subscribers. Snapdeal says it saw total number of shoppers increase four times in the sale. The latest round of spectrum auctions also concluded this week, falling short of its target by a large margin. The auction began on October 1, with the goal of shoring up gaps in spectrum holdings, and Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said the next such sale may not happen for "quite some time". However, on day 2 the auction appeared to slow down and on day 3 the auction for the 700MHz and 900MHz bands saw no takers. These 4G bands continued to be ignored by operators on day 4, and on the final day the 900MHz band still saw no takers. (Also see: What Is Spectrum, and Why Is It Being Auctioned?) Aside from this, another interesting event this week was Oculus Connect 3, Facebook's virtual reality event. Facebook is making a Web browser for VR and it showed off a lot of developments from Oculus. It showcased the Oculus Touch motion controllers, which will be available from December, and finally brought up room-scale VR, which is a pretty big development. The company also talked about a VR device that fits between the PC-powered Oculus Rift and the mobile-powered Gear VR. At OC3, Facebook talked about a standalone device that would offer experiences somewhere between these two extremes, with inside-out positional tracking. Zuckerberg also showed off Oculus Rooms and the concept of "social VR", as he showed a demo of people hanging out, holding a conference, and watching movies together using the Oculus platform. And in news you're not likely to believe - a Nokia phone saved a man's life as it stopped a bullet. And no, it wasn't the old unbreakable seeming models either, but a modern Nokia featurephone. This is actually not the first time that a Nokia phone achieved this feat. In 2014, a Nokia Lumia 520 stopped a bullet fired at a Brazilian policeman, though the handset – predictably – got destroyed in the process.

Google’s Christopher Urmson believes driverless cars will saves lives by reducing traffic deaths. Industry News Test driver goes to hospital after most serious crash in Google self-driving car Add to ... Jordan Chittley The Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Oct. 09, 2016 1:07PM EDT Last updated Sunday, Oct. 09, 2016 1:11PM EDT Comments Print / License AA A Google autonomous vehicle test driver was hospitalized after getting t-boned by a van that ran a red light near the company’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. As the Google self-driving Lexus went through a green light in manual mode, its autonomous technology detected a van that was about to run the red light and began to apply the brakes, states the company’s self-driving car report for September. The test driver put the car fully in manual mode and was then struck by the other vehicle. The Google car “sustained substantial damage to its front and rear passenger doors,” reads the report. The test driver later voluntarily went to hospital, was evaluated and then released. The driver of the other vehicle didn’t report any injuries. In the more than seven years Google has been testing self-driving cars, this is the most serious crash involving one of its cars. Google cars were also involved in three other crashes in September. Google has been teaching its cars to drive slightly above the speed limit for safety reasons and to honk at bad drivers, but the biggest obstacle is human drivers. “So much of driving relies on silent conversations conducted via gentle nudge-and-response,” reads the report. “Our cars can often mimic these social behaviours and communicate our intentions to other drivers, while reading many cues that tell us if we’re able to pass, cut in or merge.” Google says its cars are getting better at detecting and responding to crossing guards, emergency vehicles, construction zones and how to merge during rush hour. A report last year from researchers at the University of Michigan found that self-driving cars are more than four times as likely to involved in an accident than conventional cars, but the self-driving cars aren’t at fault. “Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers, who are distracted and not paying attention to the road,” wrote Chris Urmson, director of Google’s self-driving car unit, in a blog post last year. Google’s September report also shows its vehicles have driven more than 2 million fully-autonomous miles on public roads. Google says this is equivalent to 300 years of human driving experience. The first million miles took six years, but the second million took 16 months.

On the plus side, Google has made some fantastic (review pending) phones that can easily stand toe to toe with any flagship out there. With a premium look and feel and specs to match, Google has now joined the OEM community with a very strong entry. And with that strong entry comes a strong price tag. The Pixel phones are pricey. A base model costs the same as a base model iPhone, and a base model Galaxy S7. Gone are the days when Google could be counted on to release a good phone with a great price. But looking at the landscape these days, I’m not so sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. Now, it’s true that I wrote a few days ago that Google picked the wrong time to make an expensive phone. But that was based solely on the concept of price. Let’s look at the bigger picture. Stock or die Google has built a bit of a reputation for bringing good phones to the market to serve as a showcase of how Android “should be”. In a world of Android skins ranging from Touchwiz to EMUI, Google needs a showcase of Android as it is intended to be. Developers rely on a stock Android experience with fast updates to make sure their apps continue to function properly with updates as they’re released. There’s a reason Developer Previews are made available early – so when Android O comes out, the fit doesn’t hit the shan. So can developers really be expected to pick up hardware costing over $600 to develop their free face switcher app? That seems a bit much. On iOS, a developer can pick up an iPhone 6 for a couple of Benjamins. They can count on the fact that their app will run pretty much the same on it as it does on an iPhone 7. So what’s an Android Dev to do? Strong competition But more than that, and to be fair I’ve already made this argument in my other article so I’m not going to repeat every point here, but with so many great sub-$400 phones out there, why is Google suddenly upping its price game? The current crop of smartphones out there seems to be right in Google’s wheelhouse, but instead it’s swinging for the fences. That doesn’t make any sense And yet… Until you consider what Google’s ultimate goal might be here. Maybe Google isn’t competing against other midrange phones because it doesn’t want to compete against midrange phones. Maybe Google is focusing on developing a consumer product, rather than a developer product. If that’s the case, suddenly Google’s specs and price points make a heck of a lot more sense. Plus, let’s consider the fact that the Nexus line of phones hasn’t always been so low priced. Starting the with the Nexus 6 and moving forward to the 5X and the 6P, we haven’t really been seeing a lot of super low prices. The Nexus 5 may have been the last of that line. Anecdotally, when I look around, I see a lot more Nexus 5X and 6P phones around than I’ve ever seen previous Nexus phones. The consumer world has taken notice of Google’s offerings and started to buy them. It makes sense that Google would want to up its game in that arena. Going home Plus, the Pixel phone is Google’s first hardware showcase for Google Assistant, which is the direction Google wants to go. Sundar Pichai said he wants to create a personal Google for everyone in the world, and Google Assistant is a means to do so. With devices like the Google Home coming out to complement Google Assistant, Google’s initial offering to consumers has to be a consumer product – not a phone for techies and geeks, lest that the be extent of Google Assistant’s usefulness. Google Assistant is a mostly untested product, but Google seems to have a lot riding on it. To hamstring the service by offering it on a midrange phone when most people are running to Samsung and Apple, would make the service pretty much DOA. At least now with the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google can make a solid case to pick up its phone with Google Assistant, rather than the Note 7 which comes with a built in hand warmer. Oh no he didn’t. Oh yes he did. Sound off So what do you think? Is Google shooting itself in the foot with these lofty prices? Or is Google simply switching its focus from developers to consumers, and adjusting its strategy to match? Now, don’t be salty that the phone costs a lot – it’s easy to do. But focus on the big picture here, let me know what you think in the comments, and let’s see if we can figure this out. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 9, 2016 at 11:22AM Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Office cash cows once made it the top dog of the tech world. But that heyday, which lasted through most of the 1990s and early 2000s, ended when it missed the market shift toward mobile devices. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 4% this year. Image source: Microsoft. But under CEO Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early 2014, Microsoft made sweeping changes to counter its biggest headwinds -- sluggish PC sales, OS fragmentation, a poor mobile presence, and weakness in its cloud ecosystems. Let's discuss Microsoft's latest strategies to overcome each of these challenges. Weak PC sales and OS fragmentation In the past, Microsoft relied heavily on sales of Windows and Office licenses for PC users. However, sales of PCs have fallen year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, according to Gartner, due to longer-lasting hardware and an increasing dependence on mobile devices. Meanwhile, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) popularized free operating systems. Google and Apple both take a cut of app store sales within their free operating systems -- which generates more stable long-term revenue than a one-time license fee. Since a new license was required for every Windows upgrade, many users simply stuck with older, "good enough" versions. That's why Windows 7 remains the most popular PC OS with a 48% share of the market, compared to a 23% share for Windows 10. That fragmentation means that Microsoft must keep supporting outdated operating systems, and that newer features (like Cortana) might only reach a fraction of its users. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft addressed these headwinds by making Windows 10 a free year-long upgrade for most users, and tethered PCs, mobile devices, and Xbox Ones to a universal app store. The Windows Store remains much smaller than Google Play and the App Store, but it's an encouraging step toward generating revenue from apps instead of paid OS licenses. To counter similar problems with Office licenses, Microsoft pivoted toward Office 365, which runs on a cloud-based subscription model. Earlier this year, Gartner reported that Office 365 was more popular than Google Apps among large enterprise customers. Weakness in mobile and cloud ecosystems If Microsoft had a viable mobile OS, the slowdown in PC sales wouldn't be as challenging. Unfortunately, Windows Phone controlled just 0.4% of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC. Android and iOS respectively controlled 87.6% and 11.7% of the market. The lack of a mobile platform makes it hard for Microsoft to expand cloud-based features like Bing Search and Cortana. Without users feeding data to those services, the overall usefulness of its cloud platform Azure as an analytics tool declined. In response, Microsoft reduced the number of smartphones it would launch every year, and pivoted toward launching major apps like Office 365, OneDrive, Bing, and Cortana on iOS and Android. It even forged partnerships with numerous Android OEMs to pre-install those apps on their devices. Microsoft is also trying to blur the lines between mobile devices and PCs with new Surface 2-in-1 devices and Continuum, a Windows 10 feature which converts Windows 10 Mobile devices into full desktop PCs. By doing so, Microsoft is leveraging its strength in PCs (particularly among larger enterprise customers) to promote the idea of an "all in one" device to replace the smartphone, tablet, and PC. Continuum. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft is also gathering more data from its users than before with Windows 10. That practice was criticized by privacy advocates, but it's arguably necessary to get the OS, Cortana, Bing, Azure, and other Microsoft platforms onto the same cloud-based page. To do so, it recently merged the Microsoft Research and Information Platform Groups with the Bing, Cortana, robotics, and ambient computing teams to create the new AI and Research Group. That team will infuse Microsoft's apps with AI features (like Skype translate), develop new features with facial recognition and machine analytics, and expand the company's cloud infrastructure to "build the world's most powerful supercomputer with Azure." In other words, Microsoft wants to expand its cloud ecosystem to counter Google's, while helping Azure close the gap with Amazon's market-leading AWS (Amazon Web Services). But will these strategies pay off? Microsoft still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Google, Apple, and Amazon in the mobile and cloud platform markets. Nonetheless, Nadella's forward-thinking strategies are arguably superior to the complacent tactics that came before, and could gradually offset Microsoft's outdated dependence on PC sales and licensing fees.

Unlike the conservative (but cheap) Google device, this new headset does have full movement sensing, and it bridges the gap between smartphone-based VR headsets and dedicated home VR headsets (such as Rift). We predicted the rise of these “dedicated portable VR headsets” in our VR headset forecast. At Oculus’s developer conference this week, the firm sought to regain momentum after a number of recent setbacks, including unfortunate publicity around founder Palmer Luckey’s political funding, shock at the leaked price of the Touch controllers, and the HTC Vive allegedly being favoured by developers. In among the Touch demos, reduced PC-spec requirements, and new content announcements was an intriguing demo of a tetherless headset (known as “Santa Cruz”) not requiring a smartphone – in Ovum’s VR headset forecast, we dubbed such headsets “dedicated portable VR headsets” and predicted a rosy future for them. While no actual product was announced, it will be interesting to see how this headset stacks up against those based on Intel’s Alloy design, Sulon’s long-awaited headset, and the raft of devices inbound from Chinese manufacturers (all dedicated portable headsets). Done right, Oculus’s experience of movement and positional tracking for the Rift should put it in good standing to provide a better experience than those attempting their first device. The downside of this headset type remains cost vs. performance; it won’t be as powerful as a full Rift or Vive, but it will have to include expensive dedicated components normally provided by a smartphone in the cheap Daydream View headsets.

By Christian de Looper — October 5, 2016 1:00 PM Subscribe to this topic Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Google has finally unveiled the long-awaited and heavily rumored Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones, boasting some of the best specs in the business, as well as heavy Android integration, a top-notch camera, and more. In fact, these phones have the specs to match up against any flagship device out there. But how do the two new phones compare to each other? Are there any advantages to one over the other? We put the two new Google phones head to head to find out. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — oh my! Everything Google revealed at its October 4 event Performance Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Size 5.6 x 2.7 x 0.2-0.3-inches (143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3-8.5mm) 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.2-0.34-inches (154.7 x 75.7 x 7.3-8.5mm) Weight 143g (5.0 oz) 168g (5.93oz) Screen 5.0-inch AMOLED 5.5-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,080 x 1,920 pixels (441ppi) 1,440 x 2,560 pixels (534ppi) OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.1 Nougat Storage 32/128GB 32/128GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 4GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 8MP front Video 2,160p at 30fps 2,160p at 30fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer Water resistant No No Battery 2,770mAh 3,450mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Availability Google Play, Verizon Google Play, Verizon Price Starts at $650 Starts at $770 DT review Coming soon Coming soon As it turns out, there’s really very little comparison to make. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature Qualcomm’s latest and great mobile processor, the Snapdragon 821, as well as 4GB of RAM and options for either 32GB or 128GB of storage. Those certainly aren’t bad specs at all. The Snapdragon 821 is around 10 percent faster than the already-fast Snapdragon 820, ensuring that all those apps you install over the next few years continue to run smoothly and without a hitch. When it comes to RAM, it’s potentially another story. There are indeed phones out there with a hefty 6GB of RAM, like the OnePlus 3, however, that doesn’t necessarily mean faster or better performance — just look at the iPhone. While it has traditionally had less RAM, because of how deeply software and hardware are integrated, the iPhone outperforms almost all others on the market. Both Google Pixel phones are shaping up to be very high performers, but they’re about as powerful as each other — there’s no winner here. Winner: Tie Design There’s also no winner in the design department. The phones feature an identical look, except the Pixel XL is a little larger. The overall look of the phone certainly isn’t bad at all. It features a relatively premium look, that’s slightly off compared to other flagship devices. That’s largely because of the fact that half of the back is made from a metal body, while the top half of the back is made from glass — that’s the half with the fingerprint sensor and the camera. The glass does make the phone look unique, but it also looks a little like plastic, slightly detracting from the perceived quality of the device. Related: Hands on: Google Pixel and Pixel XL On the bottom of the phone, you’ll find a USB-C port and two slots. Don’t mistake those for stereo speakers — it seems like one of them is a speaker and the other a microphone slot. It’s nice that they look the same though, as it contributes to the phone’s symmetry. On the left edge, you’ll find the SIM tray, and on the right, you’ll find both the power buttons and the volume rocker. On the back, as is expected, you’ll find the fingerprint sensor, as well as the camera, which is relatively small and located in the top left-hand corner of the back. In general, the phone looks nice, if not slightly odd. Still, there’s obviously no winner, since they’re identical. You can get both in silver, black, and blue. Winner: Tie Battery Finally, something we can actually compare. The battery capacity on the Pixel is 2,770mAh, while that of the Pixel XL sits at 3,450mAh. Still, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that the extra battery merely powers the larger display for the same amount of time. Google, however, rates the Pixel XL as having a much longer battery life — it says the device can last as long as 32 hours of talk time, compared to the standard Pixel’s 26 hours. That’s an extra 6 hours, which is no small figure. Both devices also feature quick charging, which gives them as much as 7 hours of use through only 15 minutes of charging. Unfortunately, neither offer wireless charging. With the much longer battery capacity, the Pixel XL is the clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel XL Display The battery isn’t the only thing that’s different between the two phones — the display also offers a point of difference. Both displays are AMOLED, however the display on the Pixel XL is a little larger — and boasts a higher resolution. While the display on the Google Pixel is 5-inches and has a resolution of 1,080 x 1,920 pixels, the Pixel XL takes things a step further by offering a 5.5-inch display with a resolution of 1,440 x 2,560 pixels. Even with the larger size, the Pixel XL’s display is sharper, boasting 534 pixels-per-inch compared to the Pixel’s 441ppi. There’s a clear winner here, and that’s the Google Pixel XL. Winner: Google Pixel XL Camera The camera is identical on the two phones, and according to Google, it’s a good one. The rear-facing camera is 12 megapixels with an aperture of f/2.0, and while that may not technically offer as great low-light photos as other cameras, Google says the camera is the best smartphone camera ever built. Obviously, that remains to be seen once reviews start coming out, but its a good sign nonetheless. Of course, those low-light shots are also aided by the relatively large 1.55µm pixel size, which is able to draw in more light than other cameras with smaller pixel sizes, so the camera’s performance in low-light situations remains to be seen. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Which 5-inch flagship is right for you? On the front of the device, you’ll find an 8-megapixel shooter, which is a far higher resolution than most front-facing cameras. That’s nice for the selfie-lovers out there, although it’s nice to have even for those that aren’t that into selfies. Even better — all those photos you take can be backed up for free to Google Photos in original quality. Winner: Tie Software Both of the phones will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat, which is Google’s latest version of Android. The operating system has all the great new features found in Android 7.1, as well as a few more. The most notable? Google Assistant integration. Google Assistant is Google’s latest and greatest digital assistant, aimed at creating a “conversation” between users and Google. Assistant isn’t just a great way to interact with Google services — it’s also a great way to integrate with third-party apps, as Google is allowing third-party integration through “Actions on Google.” Apart from Assistant, the new version of Android also brings features like Night Light, which changes the colors shown on the screen to show less blue light. Perhaps the coolest feature on the Pixel, however, is Daydream compatibility. Daydream turns your phone into a virtual reality device, and really takes things to the next level compared to systems like Google Cardboard. Thankfully, if you pre-order the Pixel, you’ll also get a Daydream View headset for free so you can try out Daydream without having to pay anything extra. Related: Where to buy everything Google announced at its October 4 event You’ll also get automatic software updates, which is awesome. No other Android phone will get new versions of Android or security patches faster than the Pixel phones. Winner: Tie Price and availability While the Pixel XL offers a better display and a higher battery life, those things obviously come at a price — the Pixel XL costs $120 more than the standard Google Pixel. Apart from pricing, there’s an availability issue — the Pixel and Pixel XL are currently only available at Verizon, or you can get them unlocked. We recommend you buy them unlocked from Google, no matter your carrier. That way, you won’t have to be stuck with a carrier for two years. The Pixel and Pixel XL can both be pre-ordered now, with shipping expected in 2-3 weeks. Here’s a quick rundown of pricing. Pixel 32GB Pixel 128GB Pixel XL 32GB Pixel XL 128GB Verizon $650, $27.08 per month for 24 months $750, $31.24 per month for 24 months $770, 32.08 per month for 24 months $870, $36.24 per month for 24 months Google Store $650, $27.04 per month for 24 months $750, $31.21 per month for 24 months $770, $32.04 per month for 24 months $870, $36.21 per month for 24 months Winner: Pixel Winner: Pixel XL Obviously, the Google Pixel XL is the “better” phone, but the better battery and display resolution don’t come free. If you’re really into the larger screen or want a longer battery life, then you’re going to have to shell out the extra cash — but if not, there’s good news: you can get a phone with nearly equally good specs at a cheaper price. Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are shaping up to be great phones. Stay tuned for full reviews, but in the meantime, you can check out our hands-ons with them.

App gets rebranded as the… Goodbye, Google Cast! App gets rebranded as the more inclusive Google Home By Christian de Looper — October 5, 2016 2:53 PM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Google Cast is getting a rebrand. While the Chromecast first introduced us to the idea of casting, the concept has evolved with devices like Chromecast Audio and the ability to cast things to home speakers and other devices. Now, Google is rebranding the Google Cast app to be more inclusive of everything the app can do. The new name? Google Home. The rebrand certainly makes sense, especially with the advent of the Google Home device, which was launched at Google’s event on Tuesday, and offers some of the same features as other Google Cast devices. Related: Vizio debuts new SmartCast line of Google Cast-enabled sound bars This wasn’t exactly a big surprise — the latest Chromecast firmware already started referring to the app as Google Home. Now, it’s likely that the app will get a new interface enabling it to control other aspects of the smart home, as well as the new Google Home smart speaker, which was announced at Google’s event on Tuesday. It’s important to note that the concept of “casting” isn’t going away. While the Google Cast app will be rebranded, you’ll still use the casting technology to beam information to a device like the Chromecast or a home speaker. For example, you might find that a TV will be “cast-compatible.” Given the name change, Google will hopefully continue to work toward making the app a real hub for the smart home, perhaps by  incorporating other devices that may not be cast-compatible, like smart light bulbs, and including home automation. In fact, it would be great to see a Google-built alternative to apps like Yonomi, which automate the smart home and smart home devices. If the Cast app hasn’t been renamed on your device yet, it probably will be in the next few weeks. Right now, there aren’t any real changes to how the app actually works.

But there are a lot of people skeptical about whether or not Google can compete in the smart home assistant market with its current crop of offerings that has made the Amazon Echo so successful. For starters, Amazon Echo became the market leader by accident. It was the sheer vast majority of products that it offered on its website that has made it the leader and people want the kind of convenience that comes with it. Amazon already leads the online retailer market by miles. Its offerings include just about anything that a consumer might buy at a brick and mortar store like Walmart, but it goes so much further than that. The truth is, the online cyber-market is the biggest market in the world and people are looking to it for their ever-increasing laundry list of demands. Google launches voice-activated personal assistant – Google Home, for $129. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/C6yNwtSW04 — The StoreIn Deals (@thestorein) October 4, 2016 Amazon Echo was the first major device to the market with the smart assistant, and Alexa has taken consumers by storm with her vast array of options available to them. Consumers can buy digital music, buy products, make shopping lists, set reminders, answer questions, and so much more. It is safe to assume that Amazon has the market cornered in several areas, but Google is making some gains on them, especially with their voice recognition software, according to Omaha World-Herald. Calling all Alexa users! Tell us your favorite Alexa skills in the comments below. pic.twitter.com/RTHIhLUMlW — Amazon Echo (@amazonecho) August 9, 2016 Just consider what Google is already very well known for. Some might go as far to say that the world goes around because Google drives it. The business world, that is. Google has been instrumental in giving online users the ability to go to their website and find just about anything in the world they are looking for and answer any question. It is user friendly and they have expanded over the years to make the most out of their online business platform. Google has such a unique voice recognition software that it is safe to assume that it will be a leader right of the gate in that regard. But it will take a lot more than that to pull its home assistant up to the top of the market. No matter how hard Google had tried, it always lagged behind in the digital music and movies market. Although it does have these services, they pale in comparison to Amazon and Apple’s iTunes. But Google Maps can also help make up the difference. Although that feature might be better suited for the Google phone, it can also be of some use with home assistant. But what Google seriously lacks is the ability to monetize it any further than the sale of the device. There might be some options available to consumers, which could include playing music through a fee-based service or integrating it in some way with YouTube, but the options are limited. What has given Amazon the distinct advantage over Google in the home assistant market is that Amazon developed the Echo with other goals in mind. Amazon has a worldwide marketplace presence and it only made sense for them to give their consumer more efficient access to their global market. That is the primary advantage that the Amazon Echo has over the Google Home Assistant. Amazon should be really nervous about this new intelligent assistant and speaker, and it’s from Google @jmbrandonbb https://t.co/SKKJKLdjjJ — Inc. (@Inc) October 5, 2016 But a new study shows that the marketplace for the smart home assistant is mostly dominated by people who use it to play music, as reported by Geek Wire. That is an area that Amazon has capitalized on with their enormous digital music store that has been integrated with the Amazon Echo. The power of purchasing and streaming via voice commands is what seems to be really driving that trend. But anyone can see that Google is smart enough to form that conclusion themselves, thus potentially leading to a war in the digital music market.

Google and Facebook are destined to wage a decade-long war for the future Business Insider 10/9/2016 Matt Weinberger © Provided by Business Insider facebook mark zuckerberg oculus vr priscilla Back in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his grand ten-year roadmap, showing the company's trajectory from now through 2026.  Popular Searches Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 111.95 +1.09 +0.98% Highpower International Inc HPJ ▲ 2.80 +0.05 +1.82% Approach Resources Inc AREX ▼ 2.62 -0.26 -9.03% Here's that slide again, in case you missed it: © Provided by Business Insider facebook f8 roadmap It points the way to Facebook's ideal future: A world where everybody's connected to the internet, where we talk to artificially intelligent computers as if they were human, and — boldest of all —  where virtual reality goggles are as common as our smartphones, allowing us to connect with people across the world as intimately as if they were in the same room. Facebook moved the marker on this ambitious roadmap a little bit forward this week, with more details on how the social network will operate in its ideal virtual reality future. In a demo, Zuckerberg showed off "Social VR," using a combination of the Oculus Rift headset and a 360-degree camera to mash together virtual reality and the real world like never before. In Facebook's vision for the year 2026, the social network plays a key role in more, if not most, of the interactions you have with your fellow humans. It's a little creepy, given how much Facebook already permeates our personal lives, but it provides a fascinating glimpse of the radical changes coming to the technology we use.   That's not to say it will be easy for Facebook.  Just this week, Google held its own big event. And while that presentation was ostensibly to introduce new hardware, it also gave us a glimpse of how Google is thinking about its own future — and the ways in which Facebook's 10-year strategy overlap with Google's. Their core businesses couldn't be more different — Facebook's efforts to break into search haven't yielded much result; Google's attempts to become a social network are pretty much Silicon Valley punchlines at this point. Yet in many important ways, Facebook and Google are already going punch-for-punch in a fight that won't be over any time soon. Fighting from the sidelines The most visible part of their fight: Google's YouTube is the undisputed ruler for web video. But Facebook has been working hard at undermining YouTube's supremacy by attracting more media brands and advertisers to its video offerings. But the more interesting competition is in the futuristic and far-reaching technology being developed by each tech giant.  Just this past week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the company is using artificial intelligence to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Facebook is investing heavily in AI to personalize its news feed, too. © Provided by Business Insider Sundar Pichai Facebook's Oculus subsidiary may have sparked the sudden gold rush towards virtual reality, but Google isn't far behind with its Daydream View headset, also announced this week. With VR movies projected to be big business, Google doesn't want to let Facebook steal YouTube's lead in video advertising. Google's parent company Alphabet and Facebook are both making huge investments in connecting the world. Facebook is using self-piloting laser drones, and Google is using balloons, but they share a self-given mission of connecting underserved populations to the internet.  © Provided by Business Insider Project Loon On all counts, these are very future-looking businesses. Artificial intelligence is a very young field, and virtual reality is a long ways away from hitting the consumer mainstream. Even those efforts to connect the globe have regulatory hurdles to overcome in many countries. It's early enough that these are all sidelines to what each company is really good at. But with a long enough timespan — say, 10 years — there are going to be winners in each field, and there are going to be losers. And each side is stockpiling as much engineering talent as it can to make sure that they're the ones who walk away from this. Daydream believer Ultimately, what this all comes down to is growth amid great technological change. Google and Facebook, both born in the weird period between the bursting of the first dot-com bubble and Silicon Valley's current startup boom, successfully navigated the transition from the PC to the smartphone. The way Google managed that change was largely thanks to Android itself: A smartphone operating system that had Google search and services baked in at every possible level, while also available on a whole range of low- and high-end phones for every possible demographic. Now, Android is the most popular operating system in the world, and Google profits. © Provided by Business Insider Facebook F8 2016 Facebook was slow transitioning from the PC to the smartphone, but quickly caught up and now sees the majority of its users and ad revenue on mobile.  But with the smartphone boom now grinding to a halt, the established businesses of the past decade are due for a shakeup and the hunt is on for the next big thing. Whatever it turns out to be — virtual reality, AI-powered assistants, or the like — Google and Facebook are both vying to repeat the Android trick and become indispensable to the next phase of technology. This isn't a battle that will be won with one product release, one new website design, or one app. It's a war that will be fought in fits and spurts in the years to come. But for the winner comes control over the future.  NOW WATCH: Google’s new VR headset is ‘squishy and very comfortable’ — here’s what it’s like Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Business Insider Brands are using the US election to lure Americans to Canada Business Insider La Niña has officially arrived Business Insider Sears' suppliers fear the company is going bankrupt Business Insider Sears just revealed its Black Friday deals Business Insider Business Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Now it's here. But it's got an unfamiliar moniker. James Martin/CNET Why the Pixel phone isn't called the Google Phone 0 Share: Mobile by Richard Nieva October 5, 2016 2:17 PM PDT @richardjnieva Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech It's finally here: the Google Phone. Well, not quite. It's officially called "Pixel, Phone by Google," and the search giant unveiled it Tuesday during a much-hyped event in San Francisco. The Pixel, available with either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, is a grown up Google phone, meant to compete with the top brass of the smartphone world, including Samsung and Apple. It's a sharp strategic shift for Google, which has until now been content with selling phones through its Nexus program. For that, Google farmed out some of the hardware design to other manufacturers -- like LG, Asus and Huawei -- who put their brands on the phone alongside Nexus. For tech watchers, the Pixel ends years of speculation about when Google would actually build a premium phone. The rumors started the moment Google bought a tiny mobile software startup called Android in 2005, a move that eventually pit it against Apple's iOS software for the iPhone. It prompted Apple's Steve Jobs to declare he was willing to spend every bit of his company's cash on fighting a "thermonuclear" war to destroy Android. The phone has Google's signature G on the back.Photo by James Martin/CNET So when Apple announced its own foray into the smartphone market in 2007 with the iPhone, we knew something was missing, an archrival. Coke has Pepsi, the Lakers have the Celtics, Tupac had Biggie. The iPhone needed a worthy competitor, someone even more formidable than Samsung, the world's biggest maker of phones. That's why a Google phone has been a long time coming. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, a Google vice president of product management, said in an interview Tuesday. More on Pixel Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner Google Pixel cautiously rolls dice with Verizon exclusivity Google Pixel makes a bid for Android history But dreams of this hypothetical clash of the tech titans typically envisioned the iPhone (a name that Apple bought from Cisco, by the way) fighting against the Google Phone. Or maybe the Gphone, as Android co-founder Andy Rubin called it in 2007. Something you could picture in lights on a marquee or in headlines on review face-offs. Instead, we got iPhone versus...Pixel. It's not exactly epic, like Superman versus Batman (the superheros, not the movie). Google insists Pixel is the right name for its new phone. "For us, it's always represented the best of hardware and software designed and built by Google," Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, said on stage Tuesday. That's because Pixel isn't a new name. There are already Pixel Chromebook laptops and tablets that Google designed in-house. Rick Osterloh, Google's hardware chief, introduced the new phone.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, it's pretty much an unknown brand. And that may be the point, said Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based brand consultant. For most people, Google means search. The Google name doesn't have the "panache" to carry a high-end phone. "The reason the phone isn't called Google is the brand doesn't stretch that far," he said. "If you stretch a brand too far, it snaps." Plus, Google thinks people will come to know it as "the Google phone" anyway, despite its proper name, a company spokeswoman said. She points out that it says "Phone by Google" on the box and the phone itself has a big G on the back. "Phone by Google" is also printed in teeny tiny, nearly illegible letters on the bottom of the back of the phone. "People know who built this phone," Rakowski continued. "It's quite clear. We're not being shy about it." A 'most-loved' brand Maybe you're thinking it's unimportant to dissect a name, that it's just semantics. Shakespeare wrote, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." But remember, Romeo and Juliet died because of their names. "When we finally decided to do it, everyone was like, 'What took you bozos so long?'" Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management Google knows better than anyone that branding and marketing matter. Just look at the ill-fated Google Glass, which failed because, among other things, the company couldn't get the story right as to why you'd spend $1,500 on awkward eyewear. If Google wants to go up against a heavyweight like the iPhone with this new phone -- and by all accounts, it does, given the Pixel's starting price of $650 and Google's exclusive deal with Verizon as the wireless provider -- then the company needs to nail everything, including the marketing. And the name. There are probably several reasons why the company wanted to call it something besides the Google Phone. Maybe Google didn't want to scare its hardware partners, which are still deeply important when it comes to Android, by jumping into the deep end with a full-on, branded phone. Or, if the phone is a flop, it would be tough to give it a second try with another Google phone if the company has already played that name card. Google made its own premium phone to showcase its software and services.Photo by James Martin/CNET Still, the Google name is a world-class asset. It's the most valuable brand in the world, according to the BrandZ Top 100 list, a study by the branding and advertising agency Kantar Millward Brown. Who's No. 2? Apple. And when it comes to the world's most-loved brands, Google is No. 4, according to the YouGov BrandIndex. Apple is close behind at No. 6. Interestingly enough, the study also lists the iPhone as its own brand. It's No. 8. Maybe Google hopes Pixel will join the list. The ranking suggests people tend to think good things when they hear Google. What do people think when they hear Pixel? Maybe that Adam Sandler movie that got a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and 27 on Metacritic. But if Google didn't choose Pixel because Pixel could help its brand power, it could be the other way around, said Jan Dawson, CEO of Jackdaw Research. "If Google does a phone named Pixel, and it's successful, then it makes Pixel successful," he said. Or maybe there's something more subliminal at work here. A pixel, literally, is a kind of unit of measurement for images on a screen. On phones, pixels are the building blocks of software as manifested on a display. And software has always been at the heart of Google. So even though you're holding a shiny rectangle in your hand with Google's signature G on the back, Google wants to remind you that it's in the business of software. Pixels, not atoms. And in fact, that's how Google executives, standing under a digital banner that declared "Made by Google," explained it on Tuesday when they discussed why it's time for Google to make its own hardware: Software and data are bigger parts of people's lives than ever. Said Osterloh: "The rise of volume and complexity of all the information makes it so that this is the right time to be focused on hardware and software."

Facebook Inc. is working on a new virtual reality product that is more advanced than its Samsung Gear VR, but doesn't require connection to a personal computer, like the Oculus Rift does. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook... After decades of false promises, last week marked a moment when virtual reality began to set in. A new headset from Google, big investments by Facebook-owned Oculus and this week’s release of Sony’s much-anticipated headset in stores worldwide are boosting the VR industry just as the holiday shopping season arrives. “The progress we have seen across all the technology companies — Samsung, Google, HTC, Sony, Facebook — is mind boggling,” said Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, in an email. “I have seen more technological progress in the past two years than in the previous 15 combined in the VR space,” he said. “This holiday season I will be getting ‘VR’ on wish lists from relatives. That in and of itself is amazing.” Although it’s too soon to tell how far the momentum will drive revenue, virtual reality companies hope consumers get hooked by the kind of eye-popping experiences expressed by these Twitter members: Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Google’s Cardboard viewer makes VR affordable for smartphone users. Google’s Cardboard viewer makes VR affordable for smartphone users. “Last night, I experienced VR for the first time ... and now I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s incredible,” tweeted Stephanie Zuppo. “I spent 15 minutes in VR for my first time today. Amazing, and half as nauseating as expected. Game changer #lateadopter,” tweeted Tyler Finck. “It’s hard to not think that everybody would have that excitement after they try it,” said Chad Dezern, studio director at Insomniac Games, which is releasing an Oculus video game called “The Unspoken.” “Of course, we don’t know, but we’re all hopeful at this point,” Dezern said. Work on virtual reality technology, which envelops a viewer in a visual and audio experience that comes close to replicating a real-world experience, has been a decades-long journey, and it’s far from over. Juniper Research projects there will be a $50 billion worldwide market for VR hardware in 2021. Retailers, hotel managers and even the U.S. Navy, which allowed San Franciscans to virtually experience aiding special forces under enemy fire last week in a Fleet Week special, are exploring how to use the technology for marketing. With its significant hardware and software requirements, VR proved too costly and difficult to reach a wide consumer audience until 2012, when startup Oculus VR raised $2.5 million in a Kickstarter campaign to develop a somewhat affordable head-mounted viewer. Today, Oculus’ headset, called the Rift, costs $600. Just after Sony unveiled plans for its PlayStation VR viewer in 2014, Facebook bought Oculus for more than $2 billion. Following that, Google released a cheap Cardboard viewer that works with smartphones, Oculus teamed with Samsung to create the $99 Gear VR viewer, and smartphone maker HTC worked with software developer Valve to make the $800 HTC Vive headset. The Rift and Vive both went on sale this year, while Samsung released an updated version of the Gear VR, which went on sale in late 2015. Last week, Google announced the Daydream View, a $79 VR headset that operates on the tech giant’s own virtual reality platform and will work with some forthcoming Android phones. Then at Oculus Connect 3, the company’s annual developers conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Oculus is working on a mid-range viewer that would be a cut above the Gear VR, but below the Rift. He also pledged another $250 million to support development of VR games and other content. Oculus will ship hand controllers in December. Those controllers add to the realism of a VR game such as “The Unspoken,” which gives the illusion a wizard’s fireball-making hands are your own. Meanwhile, Sony’s $399 PlayStation VR headset goes on sale Thursday, with more than 30 games available now and 20 more by year’s end. Sony is hoping that many of the 40 million owners of PlayStation 4 game consoles, required to run the headset, will step up to VR. Gartner research director Brian Blau, who has closely followed the industry since 1988 as a college researcher, VR startup co-founder and analyst, has remained skeptical about the industry’s future because he’s witnessed many false starts. But Blau called last week “a seminal moment in virtual reality.” “Clearly, there’s a lot of excitement and a lot of interest,” he said. “It’s also clear there are challenges. But it’s going to be hard to look back at this week and say anything other than it was a significant transitionary week. This is the first time when people can go to the store or go online, buy VR, get it home and experience it.” Blau’s onetime business partner, Tony Parisi, now co-founder of San Francisco VR mapping startup FormVR, said he’s been waiting 21 years for this moment and believes “there’s too much momentum now.” If headsets like the PlayStation VR “have a less than stellar showing, it might be of concern, but there are just so many people investing in this, coming from so many industries,” Parisi said. “It’s not just tech pushing it.” More by Benny Evangelista Oculus, Zuckerberg announce $250 million VR investment Warriors showcase VR with Andre Iguodala bobblehead New Sacramento Kings’ arena shows off latest in sports tech The future of robots: singing lullabies, testing motorcycles Sean White, senior vice president of emerging technologies for Firefox browser creator Mozilla, said his first VR project came in 1993, when the hardware and software cost millions and was only available to a few people. Now, White is working on Mozilla’s open-source project to make virtual reality projects easily shareable using a Web browser. “A decade ago, VR was something from a science fiction movie and nobody even heard about augmented reality,” he said. “People today all around the world have at least heard of them and many have experienced them. My hope is many more will.” In his Oculus Connect 3 keynote speech, Zuckerberg gave a nod to all of his competitors for advancing virtual reality. “This is happening at a little faster rate than any of us had really expected,” he said. “We’re here to make virtual reality the next major computing platform.” Stanford’s Bailenson wasn’t ready to go that far. “In terms of redefining all computing, I think we should take one step at a time,” he said. “What we know now is that VR — at consumer prices — provides a powerful and compelling experience. For a guy who has been studying this for decades, that is enough for me.” Benny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Duo is replacing Hangouts in Google's batch of preinstalled apps Instead of swapping Hangouts for Allo, Google is apparently more interested in pushing out a better video call experience than a messaging alternative. Derek Walter on 08 October, 2016 05:06 0 - - - - print email Allo may be the future of Google’s messaging efforts, but it’s Duo that will replace Hangouts as one of the preinstalled options on future Android phones. An email about the change recently went out to partners that install Google Mobile Services on their phones. This is distinct from the Android Open Source Project, as enabling these services means agreeing to a license with Google that your phone will include this distinct bundle of apps. Basically, all devices with the Google Play Store are “Google Mobile Services” licensees, while other devices that have their own app stores don’t use the Google Mobile Services agreement. We rarely see those products here in the U.S., but Amazon’s Fire tablets are the most popular example. According to the message details, Google is dropping Hangouts from the list of apps that must be bundled on upcoming phones. Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016. It sounds like the earlier indication that Hangouts would pivot to an enterprise function is coming to be. The curious change is that it’s Duo, not Allo, that’s become the replacement. Google must see video calling as the more pivotal market right now, a function that has often been lackluster for Hangouts. Pushing out Duo puts a FaceTime competitor to everyone who buys a future Android phones, enabling them to easily video chat with friends or family members across Android and iOS. Why this matters: Duo is clearly the cool kid now when it comes to Google’s messaging efforts. I’d expect Allo to get similar bundling treatment at some point, especially since the company faces stiff competition from several messaging apps that are already hugely popular. Until then, it’s up to you to grab it from the Play Store. Brand Post Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

As we previously discussed, Tesla’s Autopilot miles are not really equivalent to Google’s self-driving miles, but it still gives us a good indication of the speed at which each company is deploying their semi-autonomous and autonomous programs. Now Google is about to speed up its effort by deploying a lot more vehicles through its partnership with Fiat-Chrysler to build a fleet of self-driving Pacifica, Chrysler’s new plug-in hybrid minivan. The first few prototypes were spotted in Mountain View over the weekend. Google is currently equipping a fleet of 100 Pacifica minivans with a new suite of sensors to test its self-driving system. The 100 prototypes will represent a significant addition to Google’s fleet which currently consists of only 24 Lexus Rx450h SUVs and 34 prototypes of its own design spread out in 4 cities: Mountain View, Kirkland, Phoenix, and Austin. The first 6 minivans arrived at one of Google’s facilities in Mountain View and the company already equipped two of them with sensor suites and installed mounting systems on others. With these new prototypes, Google is clearly trying to make its system more “commercialization-friendly”. The roof-mounted sensor suite is much smaller than the one on the Lexus Rx450h SUVs and the lidar sensor doesn’t stick out as much as on the small Google prototype car. In pictures by Mario Herger, CEO of Enterprise Garage (reprinted on 9to5Google with permission), you can actually see sensors embedded inside the front fenders which are particularly interesting: The new roof-mounted sensor suite is visibly a lot closer to the roof and features what appears to be radar antennas, lidar sensors and cameras. The Pacifica is offered with a plug-in hybrid option equipped with a 16 kWh battery pack which allows for an all-electric range of 30 miles, according to the automaker. When announcing the partnership, Google confirmed that the hybrid option was of interest to the company because of its “robust electrical architecture”. As Google deploys the new vehicles, the company is expected to rack up a lot more miles and get closer to finally commercializing its self-driving system – something it has been criticized for by former employees for not being in a hurry to do.

It’s with great regret that we forgot to credit them in the original as the source of the story. By now it should come as no surprise that Julian Assange isn’t a fan of Hillary Clinton. It doesn’t seem that he likes Google much, either. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Assange, the notorious founder of Wikileaks, detailed plans to unleash a fresh batch of leaked documents  each week until the November 7 presidential election. The first of these leaks was due yesterday, but instead of documents intended to derail the Clinton campaign, we got a plug of Assange’s book and an echo of previous statements that the leaks would come once a week between now and the election. The documents are said to expose Clinton, the military, the oil industry, and Google. Seriously. Google. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google and its current chairman seems to be the lynchpin in Assange’s new master plan. In an excerpt from his 2014 book ‘When Google Met Wikileaks,’ Assange accuses Schmidt of having ties to the State Department when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and working closely with her campaign. During this time, he reported, Google started to work more closely with the federal government. A passage from the book reads: Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad. But it has. Schmidt’s tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation. Assange’s tenure at the head of Wikileaks saw the company implicated in cable and email leaks that revealed company brass heading operations in Iran and Afghanistan. The latter saw executives attempting to move Afghani telecoms onto US military bases and the former uncovered meetings with Iranian leaders, according to Recode. These meetings were purportedly to assist US government interests. These leaks never seemed to affect Google, as the company continued to grow bigger and more powerful in the years to follow. Seemingly forgotten, the anti-Google feelings have since reemerged. Maybe it’s not unfounded. Schmidt does back a startup that provides a great deal of data for the Clinton campaign and Schmidt himself chairs a newly minted innovation board at the Pentagon. Compelling circumstantial evidence, but neither offers overwhelming evidence to support Assange’s claim. For now, we’ll just have to wait and see what Assange has up his sleeve. Correction: The original article incorrectly stated that Alphabet backed a startup that provides data for the Clinton campaign. It’s actually backed by Schmidt himself.  Here’s why Wikileaks’ Julian Assange wants to take down Google on Recode Read next: Samsung to purchase 'Viv' the AI assistant built by the creators of Siri GoogleTech Share on Facebook (796) Share on Twitter (435) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

With ID theft on the rise, South Africans have been warned to be more vigilant about how they share personal information online as criminals have become sophisticated in their phishing strategies. Following countless warnings about such cybercrime, it has become clear that our government could be (indirectly) helping the criminals with personal information through their communication tools such as the “Gazette”. To communicate with its citizens and actively encourage public participation, the Government publishes the Government Gazette, which usually includes detailed personal information ranging from physical addresses to identity numbers. Anyone who has interacted with a government department for business purposes, attended a conference, applied for an RDP house, or even applied for a title deed is compromised as their information has been published through the Gazette. This information can be retrieved through a simple Google search – a personal information breach of the highest form. The South African Fraud Prevention Association has stated that criminals use stolen ID documents, often changing the photograph to open fraudulent bank accounts, get credit and buy high-value items. This form of crime has increased by more than 200 percent in the last six years. The government has rightly identified this as a risk for its citizens and national security and tabled the PoPI Act in Parliament for the sole purpose of ensuring all South African institutions conduct themselves in a responsible way when collecting, processing, storing and sharing another entity's personal information by holding them accountable. The PoPI legislation considers personal information to be “precious goods” and therefore aims to restore certain rights of protection and the ability to exercise control over: When and how information is shared through consent. The type and extent of information shared. Transparency and accountability on how data will be used (limited to the purpose) and notification if/when the data is compromised. Providing access to personal information as well as the right to have data removed and/or destroyed should the owner so wish. Who has access to your information… There must be adequate measures and controls in place to track access and prevent unauthorised people, even within the same company, from accessing your information. How and where information is stored (there must be adequate measures and controls in place to safeguard information to protect it from theft, or being compromised). The integrity and continued accuracy of information (your information must be captured correctly and once collected, the institution is responsible to maintain it). PoPI info sourced: https://www.workpool.co/featured/popi/ So what does this have to do with me? Let me give you some classic examples where this can play an important part in you becoming a crime statistic. Stalker – by simply searching your name on Google, they can find information that you would not share with strangers, including your current residential address. Such information may be used to further traumatise you or even lead to devastating end results where you or your loved one is kidnapped for ransom and such events could even lead to fatalities. If you live in an urbanised area, the stalker can have a clear and undisturbed view through Google Street views and they can familiarise themselves with your place before they launch an attack. Targeted car hijacking – this can be easily achieved by using your ID to register on websites that check traffic fines online. These websites need basic information that can be faked and once you have loaded everything you can view traffic infringements that have your car make and clear picture. Remember, that since our government put your ID and current residential address out there criminals now know exactly where you live. They may pay you a visit, learn about your moves and finally make their move. Filtering their targets is easy. ID numbers show your age and names give them a sense of who they are targeting. For example, if you are a 42-year-old Johan Smith there's a good chance you drive the most-wanted car. Social engineering – in computer-related crimes or cybercrime. Social engineering is a technique used by hackers and non-hackers to get access to confidential information. With social engineering, attackers use manipulation and deceit. This time, they won't even have to call you; they can call your service provider and take over your accounts. In general, service providers ask for basic personal information to verify that they are speaking to the rightful owner of the account. Normally, they would ask for the ID number, current or previous residential address and e-mail address. This information is easy to get online. People share too much information on social networks and with a simple search “by names as per the Gazette” your social network profile may be popping up in a Google search. Since we have a dilemma of corrupt Home Affairs officials, anything is possible. They may reprint your ID from their homes’ operation centre using personal information that we publish on Gazettes and this can lead to problems. Ever received a call where the caller is asking for more information and banking details? Well just imagine if they read your ID number and residential address to you, the chances of trusting them would get higher because it is common to trust people who know a lot about you. I would like to give more examples, but I hope these few put you in the bigger picture. Here's a funny one from my own experience. Some time ago I was "persuading" a girl. We got along nicely, but she refused to reveal her age, as is usual with girls. I decide to search her name on Google. Surprisingly, her ID number and current residential address popped up in the search results! One day I sent her her ID number and residential address in the middle of our conversation and she freaked out. Well, she blocked me on WhatsApp and after some few hours she came back to life, asking me how did I know all her personal information. I even forgot my come-back trick, but in her mind I was the sickest stalker, even capable of murder. As adults we got over it. However, I've learnt a lesson and I hope she did too – never hide your age if you are a South African (just kidding). Crime investigation and prevention organisations can share more tricks used by criminals with your personal identification information to commit crime. Disclosure of personal information through the Gazette can lead to: house hijackings, deceased estate fraud, blackmail, kidnappings, human trafficking, registering cars that are used to commit crime in your name, and so on. What is an ID number, in actuality? The first six numbers are the birth date of the person in YYMMDD format, so my ID number starts with 820101. The next four are a gender, 5000 and above is male and below 5000 is female. So my ID number would have a number of 5000 or greater. The next number is the country ID, 0 is South Africa and 1 is not. My ID number will have 0 here. The second last number used to be a racial identifier but now means nothing. The last number is a check bit. Which verifies the rest of the number. So the complete ID number structure is: 820101(5000-9999)0XX Now let’s see how easy it is to get some ID numbers using the internet search engine Google. There are many ways to get results, but the simple one is to search by the last seven numbers of your ID number, ie “XXXX XXX” and adding the keyword Gazette. So the search string would be: Gazette “XXXX XXX” However, to date there is no sense of urgency from the government on the following, as the president has not announced the commencement of the PoPI Act, nor have details of the Information Regulator surfaced. It was anticipated that the PoPI commencement date would be towards the end of 2016, but no later than May 24, 2017. It is also speculated that perhaps the sophistication of such an act may be baffling and needs additional expertise to assist with implementation. Equally so, we call upon our government to exercise some urgency in this matter, as there may be some unintended consequences which include security breaches that range in severity – from terrorism to credit fraud. Citizens are the rightful owners of their personal security information, government is urged to amend the law and review the gazetting communications tools to restore integrity and respect to personal information. South Africa can no longer afford to be naive about the cybersecurity crimes that are a global phenomena; at the very least this threatens the core rights of citizens as protected by our constitution. • Mlangeni is an IT Systems Manager for a Johannesburg-based Information Technology, Security and Business Processes company   Most Viewed Property Business Directory Pictures Art work as therapy for young offenders November 1 2016 Crowded Pollsmoor conditions 'shocking' November 1 2016 More Multimedia Video Video: Bafana versus Nigeria September 12 2014 More Multimedia You are here: IOL / CapeTimes / 'I know where you live, stole your ID number' We like to make your life easier RSS feeds Subscribe to one of our feeds and receive instant news.

By Joe McKendrick for Service Oriented | October 9, 2016 -- 11:00 GMT (04:00 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software When Google first came on the scene in the late 1990s, Internet search engines were a dime a dozen, and the space was led by the likes of AltaVista, Yahoo and Lycos. But Google seemed to understand something a little more intuitively than the others, which propelled them ahead. Users wanted speed, simplicity and elegance in their searches. Photo: Joe McKendrick So what can the company that mastered the art and science of UX all the way to the top of the global business world tell us about UX these days? Appcue's Ty Magnin recently took an informative walk-through of Alphabet/Google's "HEART" approach to managing and providing a superior user experience. The HEART approach (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task success) was put in practice several years ago. The guidelines make a great deal of sense in terms of staying on top of user preferences. "What I find so appealing about HEART is that it pins the discipline of user experience to revenue-driving metrics--a connection I previously struggled making," says Magnin. Google successfully made the connection between UX and the business through effective use of data analytics. In a paper they published a few years back, Kerry Rodden, Hilary Hutchinson, and Xin Fu (now with LinkedIn) described Google Research's process. HEART, along with a process called Goals-Signals-Metrics, was created as a "framework and process for defining large-scale user-centered metrics, both attitudinal and behavioral," which is suitable for any organization interested in data-driven UX, they said. Google's Rodden provides a more recent update on HEART and GSM in GV Library, noting that "we like to think of large-scale data analysis as just another UX research method." Here is how that breaks down, as explained by Rodden and the Google team: Happiness. This applies to attitudinal metrics, the authors note, including aspects such as "subjective aspects of user experience, like satisfaction, visual appeal, likelihood to recommend, and perceived ease of use." They advocate the use of well-designed surveys to "track the same metrics over time to see progress as changes are made." This has helped Google designers determine if negative reactions to new features has more to do with change aversion, or actual declines in satisfaction. Engagement: This encompasses the degree of users' frequency, intensity, or depth of interaction over some time period." Examples of metrics, the team continues, may include "the number of visits per user per week, or the number of photos uploaded per user per day." Adoption and Retention: These metrics "can be used to provide stronger insight into counts of the number of unique users in a given time period (e.g. seven-day active users),addressing the problem of distinguishing new users from existing users. Adoption metrics "track how many new users start using a product during a given time period." Retention metrics "track how many of the users from a given time period are still present in some later time period." Task success: The metrics coming out of this phase tie into more "traditional behavioral metrics of user experience, such as efficiency (e.g. time to complete a task), effectiveness (e.g.percent of tasks completed), and error rate." The way to track and measure task success is through remote usability or benchmarking studies that look at specific tasks, the Google team states. The key to implementing a HEART methodology is the ability to articulate and track goals, signals and metrics, the Google team adds. Defining goals helps to figure out what metrics are best applied, Rodden says. "Next, map your goals to lower-level signals," she says. "How might success or failure in the goals actually manifest itself in user behavior or attitudes?" Then, refine those signals "into metrics you'll track over time or use for comparison in an A/B test." At the time Rodden and her team wrote the original paper, they had applied the HEART framework and the Goals-Signals-Metrics process "to more than 20 different products and projects from a wide variety of areas within Google." Just as important to the data-driven process is communication, Magnin observes. "Google uses many means of communication," he says, combining "email, feedback forms, tool tips, and modals to increase the HEART of their products and drive more revenue to the fourth most valuable company in the world."

How to join the network Recently, Google launched a video calling tool (yes, another one). Google Hangouts has been sidelined to Enterprise, and Google Duo is supposed to be the next big thing in video calling. So now we have Skype from Microsoft, Facetime from Apple, and Google with Duo. Each big company has its own equivalent service, each stuck in its own bubble. These services may be great, but they aren’t exactly what we imagined during the dream years when the internet was being built. The original purpose of the web and internet, if you recall, was to build a common neutral network which everyone can participate in equally for the betterment of humanity. Fortunately, there is an emerging movement to bring the web back to this vision and it even involves some of the key figures from the birth of the web. It’s called the Decentralised Web or Web 3.0, and it describes an emerging trend to build services on the internet which do not depend on any single “central” organisation to function. So what happened to the initial dream of the web? Much of the altruism faded during the first dot-com bubble, as people realised that an easy way to create value on top of this neutral fabric was to build centralised services which gather, trap and monetise information. Search Engines (e.g. Google), Social Networks (e.g. Facebook), Chat Apps (e.g. WhatsApp) have grown huge by providing centralised services on the internet. For example, Facebook’s future vision of the internet is to provide access only to the subset of centralised services it endorses (Internet.org and Free Basics). Meanwhile, it disables fundamental internet freedoms such as the ability to link to content via a URL (forcing you to share content only within Facebook) or the ability for search engines to index its contents (other than the Facebook search function). The Decentralised Web envisions a future world where services such as communication, currency, publishing, social networking, search, archiving etc are provided not by centralised services owned by single organisations, but by technologies which are powered by the people: their own community. Their users. The core idea of decentralisation is that the operation of a service is not blindly trusted to any single omnipotent company. Instead, responsibility for the service is shared: perhaps by running across multiple federated servers, or perhaps running across client side apps in an entirely “distributed” peer-to-peer model. Even though the community may be “byzantine” and not have any reason to trust or depend on each other, the rules that describe the decentralised service’s behaviour are designed to force participants to act fairly in order to participate at all, relying heavily on cryptographic techniques such as Merkle trees and digital signatures to allow participants to hold each other accountable. There are three fundamental areas that the Decentralised Web necessarily champions:privacy, data portability and security. Privacy: Decentralisation forces an increased focus on data privacy. Data is distributed across the network and end-to-end encryption technologies are critical for ensuring that only authorized users can read and write. Access to the data itself is entirely controlled algorithmically by the network as opposed to more centralized networks where typically the owner of that network has full access to data, facilitating  customer profiling and ad targeting. Data Portability: In a decentralized environment, users own their data and choose with whom they share this data. Moreover they retain control of it when they leave a given service provider (assuming the service even has the concept of service providers). This is important. If I want to move from General Motors to BMW today, why should I not be able to take my driving records with me? The same applies to chat platform history or health records. Security: Finally, we live in a world of increased security threats. In a centralized environment, the bigger the silo, the bigger the honeypot is to attract bad actors. Decentralized environments are safer by their general nature against being hacked, infiltrated, acquired, bankrupted or otherwise compromised as they have been built to exist under public scrutiny from the outset.   Just as the internet itself triggered a grand re-levelling, taking many disparate unconnected local area networks and providing a new neutral common ground that linked them all, now we see the same pattern happening again as technology emerges to provide a new neutral common ground for higher level services. And much like Web 2.0, the first wave of this Web 3.0 invasion has walked among us for several years already. Git is wildly successful as an entirely decentralised version control system – almost entirely replacing centralised systems such as Subversion. Bitcoin famously demonstrates how a currency can exist without any central authority, contrasting with a centralised incumbent such as Paypal. Diaspora aims to provide a decentralised alternative to Facebook. Freenet paved the way for decentralised websites, email and file sharing. Less famously, StatusNet (now called GNU Social) provides a decentralised alternative to Twitter. XMPP was built to provide a decentralised alternative to the messaging silos of AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, MSN, and others. Telephone switchboard operators circa 1914. Photo courtesy Flickr and reynermedia. However, these technologies have always sat on the fringe — favourites for the geeks who dreamt them up and are willing to forgive their mass market shortcomings, but frustratingly far from being mainstream. The tide is turning . The public zeitgeist is finally catching up with the realisation that being entirely dependent on massive siloed community platforms is not entirely in the users’ best interests. Critically, there is a new generation of Decentralised Startups that have got the attention of the mainstream industry, heralding in the new age for real. Blockstack and Ethereum show how Blockchain can be so much more than just a cryptocurrency, acting as a general purpose set of building blocks for building decentralised systems that need strong consensus. IPFS and the Dat Project provide entirely decentralised data fabrics, where ownership and responsibility for data is shared by all those accessing it rather than ever being hosted in a single location. The real step change in the current momentum came in June at the Decentralised Web Summit organised by the Internet Archive. The event brought together many of the original “fathers of the internet and World Wide Web” to discuss ways to “Lock the web open” and reinvent a web “that is more reliable, private, and fun.” Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, saw first hand the acceleration in decentralisation technologies whilst considering how to migrate the centralised Internet Archive to instead be decentralised: operated and hosted by the community who uses it rather being a fragile and vulnerable single service. Additionally, the enthusiastic presence of Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf, Brewster himself and many others of the old school of the internet at the summit showed that for the first time the shift to decentralisation had caught the attention and indeed endorsement of the establishment. Tim Berners-Lee said: The web was designed to be decentralised so that everybody could participate by having their own domain and having their own webserver and this hasn’t worked out. Instead, we’ve got the situation where individual personal data has been locked up in these silos. […] The proposal is, then, to bring back the idea of a decentralised web. To bring back power to people. We are thinking we are going to make a social revolution by just tweaking: we’re going to use web technology, but we’re going to use it in such a way that we separate the apps that you use from the data that you use. We now see the challenge is to mature these new technologies and bring them fully to the mass market. Commercially there is huge value to be had in decentralisation: whilst the current silos may be washed away, new ones will always appear on top of the new common ground, just as happened with the original Web. Github is the posterchild for this: a $2 billion company built entirely as a value-added service on top of the decentralised technology of Git — despite users being able to trivially take their data and leave at any point.  Similarly, we expect to see the new wave of companies providing decentralised infrastructure and commercially viable services on top, as new opportunities emerge in this brave new world. Ultimately, it’s hard to predict what final direction Web 3.0 will take us, and that’s precisely the point. By unlocking the web from the hands of a few players this will inevitably enable a surge in innovation and let services flourish which prioritise the user’s interests. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others have their own interests at heart (as they should), but that means that the user can often be viewed purely as a source of revenue, quite literally at the users’ expense. As the Decentralised Web attracts the interest and passion of the mainstream developer community, there is no telling what new economies will emerge and what kinds of new technologies and services they will invent. The one certainty is they will intrinsically support their communities and user bases just as much as the interests of their creators.

Almost every move by Apple, Google or Facebook is seen through the lens of offence or defence, either against each other or towards a nimbler startup trying to turn them into yesterday’s news. But as well as competing directly, these clashes between titans have manifested themselves collaterally into a series of ideological arguments. Take the battle between privacy and progress: Apple, for example, has taken a strict line on using customers’ information, while others are more relaxed, partly because their use of data has allowed them to make great strides in areas such as artificial intelligence. Another one of these religious splits has been in the idea of “open” against “closed” systems. The first is the idea that technology should be infinitely tweakable and free of bias. It is the libertarian foundation of the world wide web: democratic rather than dictatorial. Closed means that the technology is less flexible, that decisions are taken by those who know better, rather than letting the user run amok. It is authoritarian, if largely benevolent. Google Pixel: hands on review Play! 00:36 Those that worship at the altar of open include Wikipedia and Mozilla, which develops the Firefox web browser. At the other end of the spectrum are Nintendo, which has tightly controlled both its video game software and hardware, and Facebook, which rigorously controls how its users experience the social network. But it is the two biggest tech companies that best represent this divide. In the open corner is Google, which was born on and is dependent on the web, and dreams of indexing the entire world’s information for everyone. On the closed side is Apple, which is obsessively devoted to simplicity and as a result shields its users from having too many choices. Google’s Android mobile software, which runs on thousands of smartphones, is free and massively customisable. iOS, Apple’s operating system, runs on one mobile - the iPhone - and uniform across devices. One is open, one is closed, and that is how it has been since both existed. Until last week, at least. For on Wednesday, Google took a leap into the unknown by unveiling its first phone. The Google Pixel is intended to be a direct competitor to the iPhone (as the frequency of Google’s potshots at Apple during its presentation showed). At its heart is the Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence designed to respond to millions of voice queries and demonstrate the power of the company’s smarts. google biggest failures It is a rare foray into hardware for Google, which has traditionally left the job of making Android phones to other manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC. This has served it fairly well, with Android accounting for four in five phones sold globally, so why do it, especially in 2016, as growth in smartphone sales peters out and innovation seemingly dries up? Partially, at least, the answer lies in frustration at the state of the equipment manufacturers that Android relies on. HTC is in dire financial straits, and others such as Sony are losing market share. Samsung also appeared to be in trouble a year ago, and although has enjoyed a rebound in sales recently, Google had made the decision to sell its own handsets by then (now that the Korean group has been thrown into turmoil by defective handsets, the decision looks tremendously prescient). The fastest growing phone makers are in China, where Android has no Google services due to the company’s blackout of the country. Google has also been frustrated at the endless tampering with Android by manufacturers, who have often promoted their own apps and relegating Google’s. It is partly why the company requires that its search engine and web browser be installed on any Android phone that wants to use the Google Play app store, a directive that has landed it in hot water with EU competition regulators. The history of Google Play! 02:31 The new Google Assistant software that features in the Pixel is a crucial element of the company’s future: computing is moving away from the web searches that make the majority of the company’s money and towards artificial intelligence that can talk and answer questions, so naturally Google is desperate to control this new channel. So ask yourself: if you were Google, and needed Assistant to be a success at this crucial juncture, would you leave it to unreliable third parties or take things into your own hands? Suddenly, being a little less open and (whisper it quietly), a little bit more like Apple, starts to look attractive. Control both the hardware and the software, and you can be sure that customers are getting what you intend them to. Google’s ambitions go beyond the phone: the internet giant is also set to release the Google Home, a voice-controlled smart speaker that also puts the company’s AI at its heart. The two products will work together as well as with the Chromecast, its internet TV device. Gradually, it is building an “ecosystem” of products, seamlessly tied together with its software: another strategy that Apple’s iPhone, iPad and Mac have used to great effect.

But for those of us who don’t have a lifetime to spend split-testing every element, I’ve created this 15-minute guide for auditing your website. Note: For this guide, I used the latest version of my tool, WebSite Auditor, to crawl my website, analyze site errors, fix broken links and redirects, review my title and meta tags, optimize on-page content and images, etc. I use this software instead of separate crawling, keyword research, and link analysis tools, but you can follow along using your favorite auditing tools instead. 1. Crawl and Audit Your Website Quick audits are helpful, but comprehensive audits are invaluable when it comes to the health of your website. Start crawling your website by entering its URL into your favorite SEO crawling tool. Make sure that your crawling tool is capable of scanning every resource on your website (JavaScript, CSS, Images, Video, Flash, etc.). This scan usually only takes a few minutes, but time will vary depending on the size of your website. Checklist: Crawl your website. 2. Check for Crawlability/Indexing Issues Once you’ve scanned your website, it’s time to review anything that might be affecting your website’s crawlability. Some of the most common problems include poorly maintained sitemaps, robots.txt errors, and HTTP response code errors. Check your sitemap If you’re using a tool or plugin to automatically manage your sitemap, you should be able to automatically create an XML sitemap or retrieve, view, and validate an existing sitemap. If you’re not using a sitemap tool, you’ll have to manually review your sitemap. Either way, you want to make sure that your sitemap is accurate and up-to-date. Once you’ve updated your sitemap, check it for errors in Google Search Console. Simply log in to your account, go to Crawl > Sitemaps and then click the Add/Test Sitemaps button. Enter the URL of your sitemap and click Test to see if Google encounters any errors while parsing your sitemap. Check your robots.txt A page might be blocked from indexing for a variety of reasons. For example, it could have a “noindex” tag in its <head> section, the X-Robots-Tag in the HTTP header, or it could be that your robots.txt file itself is blocking the page. Using your auditing tool, check your robots.txt’s instructions and see if any important pages are being blocked. If they are, you need to add an allow rule to enable indexing. If you’re struggling with CSS and JavaScript being disallowed in particular, Google’s Gary Illyes recommends you allow Google to crawl these resources by adding the following three lines of code to your robots.txt file: Check your website for errors HTTP response code errors are easy to detect and responsible for many indexing errors. You can check your website for crawl errors through your site auditing tool or by going to Crawl > Crawl Errors in your Google Search Console. You can correct whatever 4XX errors you find by fixing your internal links or setting up 301 redirects that point visitors to similar pages (especially useful on e-commerce sites). Also, make sure that your website has a 404 page set up in the first place to link your visitors back to your website’s important pages. Ask Google (and other search engines) to re-crawl your pages Whenever you’ve finished making these essential on-site improvements, you can ask search engines to re-crawl your pages. This will let you know if you still have errors that need addressing or if you can submit your page for indexing. To have Google re-crawl a page, log into your Google Search Console, go to Crawl > Fetch as Google, enter the URL of the updated page, and click Fetch. Checklist: Fix any errors on your sitemap. Review your robots.txt file. Ensure all of your important pages can be indexed. Fix HTTP errors. Ask search engines to re-crawl your site. 3. Avoid Common Redirect Mistakes If redirects don’t properly funnel visitors to the right page when that page has moved or changed URL, they pose a potential problem for SEO. Here are some of the most common issues: 302 redirects 302 redirects, aka. “temporary” redirects, tell search engines that you’re temporarily redirecting visitors, but that the missing page will return shortly. As such, 302 redirects won’t pass on many qualities (e.g. PageRank, Traffic Value, etc.) that a 301 redirect would. This is fine if you’re doing something like testing a new page, but you should try to replace these redirects with 301s otherwise. Meta refresh Inserting code into a page’s metadata that automatically redirects visitors results in a “meta refresh.” Spammers tend to abuse this by redirecting visitors to pages with unrelated content, and as such it is penalized by most search engines. Rel=”canonical” issues If you have some duplicate content on multiple pages, you should indicate which page is the primary page by setting it up as your canonical URL. Each page should have no more than one canonical URL. Most site auditors will allow you to view your rel=”canonical” pages under a Redirects tab. Checklist: Replace temporary redirects (302) with permanent redirects (301). Remove meta refresh from pages Check for rel=”canonical” issues. 4. Fix HTML and CSS markup Errors Coding errors slow down your website, interrupt user experience, and essentially shoot your SEO in the foot. Performing regular website audits can help you detect and correct these errors as they crop up. Some issues to look for include pages that are too big, pages that use frames, and pages that contain W3C errors and warnings. Checklist: Find and correct common coding errors 5. Fix Your Links and URLs One of the fastest ways to regain lost link equity is to find and fix broken backlinks. Use your auditing tool to keep tabs on all of your Broken Links and then fix them by either contacting the webmasters who have linked to your website or by creating 301 redirects that link back to relevant, updated pages. Here are some other best practices: Limit outgoing links When 100 or more outbound links originate from a single page, it tells search engines that the page might be spam. Limit the number of links you include per page. Limit redirects Whenever possible, fix 301 and 302 redirects by changing links to lead visitors directly to their destination page. The more links you have, the more you use up your search engine crawl budget. Change dynamic URLs Dynamically generated URLs are often difficult to read and don’t tell users where they’re heading. Try to fix dynamic URLs so that they’re more user-friendly. Shorten long URLs Recent evidence suggests that URLs with 35–40 characters dominate search listings. Of course, long URLs can rank—but practice brevity wherever possible. Checklist: Fix broken links Mitigate outgoing links Limit redirects Fix unreadable URLs Keep your URLs short and sweet 6. Review Your Title Tags, Meta Tags, and Header Tags It doesn’t take much to fix a bad meta description or to turn a good title tag into a great one. The goal of all of your titles and meta descriptions is to inform visitors (and bots) what your page is about and, whenever possible, to include a choice keyphrase or two. Here are some best practices: Fix empty or lengthy titles and meta descriptions Most SEO auditing tools will tell you when your titles and meta descriptions aren’t optimized. Make sure all of your titles fall within the appropriate character count (That means 50-60 characters for the title; 150-160 characters for the description). Avoid duplicate titles and meta descriptions E-commerce sites, in particular, suffer from duplicate content, or meta descriptions that read very similarly. Duplicate content can confuse search engines to the point where they rank none of your pages, so try to keep your content as unique as possible. Target buying phrases Header (H1) tags are important on-page ranking factors. Use these to target specific buying phrases that users are likely to search for. Try to Also try to avoid generic subheaders (H2, H3, etc.); use them to target secondary keywords where appropriate. Checklist: Optimize titles for SEO Optimize meta descriptions for SEO Optimize header tags for SEO 7. Optimize Your Content Since Panda’s launch, high-quality content has been the defining factor of a great website. In other words, you need to make sure that each of your pages has enough content and that the content is unique and valuable. You may want to invest in a grammar tool (e.g. Grammarly) and a plagiarism checker (e.g. Copyscape) to help you with this stage (they’re free!). Here’s what I did: Identify thin content To make sure that every page had enough relevant data, I filtered my pages by word count. I did this by right-clicking on the header of any column and adding a new column called Word Count. Then I made sure that every page had 1-2 paragraphs of text (aiming for at least 250 words per page). I also double-checked their formatting and readability while I was at it. Corrected duplicate content It’s in your best interests to ensure that all your titles and descriptions are unique. The thing is duplicate titles and descriptions are confusing to search engines as they wouldn’t know which of the pages should be ranked in response to a given query. Often, they’d choose to rank neither page instead. Audit site images Searching for broken images is all well and good, but you should also look for images without alt tags as an additional SEO opportunity. Checklist: Find and add to thin content Make content as unique as possible Fix broken images and empty alt text tags Conclusion You’re done! While this is by no means the limit of the optimization you could perform on your site, it’s a great start and one that will ensure your website stays healthy and relevant. Of course, if you’re feeling particularly ambitious (and have a bit more time to spare), you can start digging into the complete website audit you performed in Step 1.   Image Credits Featured image: tashatuvango/DepositPhotos.com All screenshots by Aleh Barysevich.

It covers the most important on-page SEO factors that when optimized should improve your organic visibility in search.

The company announced two new smartphones a few days ago called Pixel and Pixel XL. These are the first smartphones made by Google inside and out, hence the company’s emphasis on the “Made by Google” branding. To drive that point home, the company is going to open a Made by Google pop-up store in New York later this month. Google’s biggest rivals – Apple and Microsoft – have massive permanent retail stores in New York City. Google hasn’t challenged them with a big retail space of its own but that might be a possibility down the road. Since this is going to be a pop-up store, it’s quite likely that this will be a temporary affair. It’s unclear right now for how many days this pop-up store will be operational and which products will be sold directly to customers. Google did unveil several new products alongside Pixel, including but not limited to a smart Wi-Fi router, a smart Home speaker, and a VR headset. The Made by Google pop-up store will be located at 96 Spring St in New York, 10012. The company’s website mentions that it’s “coming October 20.” Filed in Gadgets. Read more about pixel and pixel xl.

I couldn’t decide whether to write “Scary Google” or “Scary Good.” I’m certainly having both reactions after watching the Google press event on Tuesday that introduced their newest products. Let’s start by musing about the fact that Google, while lobbying the FCC hard to get set-top boxes disengaged from the cable operator for whom they are a necessity, is at the same time moving its own products “in house,” and deciding that they should build them themselves, a la Apple. The explanation of why: well they think they can do it better, they can control the quality better, and they can integrate the services better. Now all you have to do is listen to Brian Roberts give the same explanation why and how the Xfinity X1 set-top box has been such a success to understand, from a business or consumer benefit point of view, the FCC is just flat out going in the wrong direction! But I digress. The new Google phone, the Pixel, looks like a winner. The most important part is that it integrates the new Google Assistant, which is like Siri, or Cortona, or Alexa but with an added twist; it has all the computing power of Google and a decade of developing artificial intelligence behind it. To me the ability to integrate actions and execute on them is the key to making things simple, and simplicity is the key to keeping all but the few of us techno-geeks, happy. The Google Assistant is also, more importantly from our business point of view, baked into the new Google Home speaker device. As I have already written, this looks a bit like Amazon’s Alexa on steroids. I’ve already ordered one, and will let you know how it works when it arrives in November (it’s cheaper than the Amazon Echo) but the thing that fascinates me most is its ability to integrate with Google’s Chromecast devices (there’s a new one of those coming as well, 4K, HDR). The demonstration during the press rollout is worth watching. The Home device links to the Chromecast device and allows you to do things like ask for a particular program in a participating vendor (like Netflix’s) catalog and the with just a voice command the television starts showing you the program you asked for. Now that, in itself, is a real trick, but I foresee this as just the beginning. Google didn’t need the FCC to write all sorts of new rules to allow it to disaggregate product. That’s going to happen no matter what just by the inherent power that is being built into these devices and put in homes. Imagine not needing a remote control at all!  That’s where they are trying to go, and they will accumulate all the data on what you watch and what you are looking for through the voice controlled Google Home device. While there will be “turf wars” for a while (no Amazon Prime Chromecasting, for instance) I doubt that will last, particularly for cable folks. If you want to give your customers a premier experience, you are going to have to get on board, and I would say sooner rather than later. That’s why Google both scares me, and I am somewhat in awe of what they are doing. They appear to be darn good at it, and if these new devices work… well, it sort of suggests my title is correct the way it is; remember the film “The Blob?

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 9, 2016 at 11:22AM Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows and Office cash cows once made it the top dog of the tech world. But that heyday, which lasted through most of the 1990s and early 2000s, ended when it missed the market shift toward mobile devices. That's why analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 4% this year. Image source: Microsoft. But under CEO Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer in early 2014, Microsoft made sweeping changes to counter its biggest headwinds -- sluggish PC sales, OS fragmentation, a poor mobile presence, and weakness in its cloud ecosystems. Let's discuss Microsoft's latest strategies to overcome each of these challenges. Weak PC sales and OS fragmentation In the past, Microsoft relied heavily on sales of Windows and Office licenses for PC users. However, sales of PCs have fallen year-over-year for seven consecutive quarters, according to Gartner, due to longer-lasting hardware and an increasing dependence on mobile devices. Meanwhile, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) popularized free operating systems. Google and Apple both take a cut of app store sales within their free operating systems -- which generates more stable long-term revenue than a one-time license fee. Since a new license was required for every Windows upgrade, many users simply stuck with older, "good enough" versions. That's why Windows 7 remains the most popular PC OS with a 48% share of the market, compared to a 23% share for Windows 10. That fragmentation means that Microsoft must keep supporting outdated operating systems, and that newer features (like Cortana) might only reach a fraction of its users. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft addressed these headwinds by making Windows 10 a free year-long upgrade for most users, and tethered PCs, mobile devices, and Xbox Ones to a universal app store. The Windows Store remains much smaller than Google Play and the App Store, but it's an encouraging step toward generating revenue from apps instead of paid OS licenses. To counter similar problems with Office licenses, Microsoft pivoted toward Office 365, which runs on a cloud-based subscription model. Earlier this year, Gartner reported that Office 365 was more popular than Google Apps among large enterprise customers. Weakness in mobile and cloud ecosystems If Microsoft had a viable mobile OS, the slowdown in PC sales wouldn't be as challenging. Unfortunately, Windows Phone controlled just 0.4% of the global smartphone market in the second quarter, according to IDC. Android and iOS respectively controlled 87.6% and 11.7% of the market. The lack of a mobile platform makes it hard for Microsoft to expand cloud-based features like Bing Search and Cortana. Without users feeding data to those services, the overall usefulness of its cloud platform Azure as an analytics tool declined. In response, Microsoft reduced the number of smartphones it would launch every year, and pivoted toward launching major apps like Office 365, OneDrive, Bing, and Cortana on iOS and Android. It even forged partnerships with numerous Android OEMs to pre-install those apps on their devices. Microsoft is also trying to blur the lines between mobile devices and PCs with new Surface 2-in-1 devices and Continuum, a Windows 10 feature which converts Windows 10 Mobile devices into full desktop PCs. By doing so, Microsoft is leveraging its strength in PCs (particularly among larger enterprise customers) to promote the idea of an "all in one" device to replace the smartphone, tablet, and PC. Continuum. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft is also gathering more data from its users than before with Windows 10. That practice was criticized by privacy advocates, but it's arguably necessary to get the OS, Cortana, Bing, Azure, and other Microsoft platforms onto the same cloud-based page. To do so, it recently merged the Microsoft Research and Information Platform Groups with the Bing, Cortana, robotics, and ambient computing teams to create the new AI and Research Group. That team will infuse Microsoft's apps with AI features (like Skype translate), develop new features with facial recognition and machine analytics, and expand the company's cloud infrastructure to "build the world's most powerful supercomputer with Azure." In other words, Microsoft wants to expand its cloud ecosystem to counter Google's, while helping Azure close the gap with Amazon's market-leading AWS (Amazon Web Services). But will these strategies pay off? Microsoft still has a long way to go before it can catch up to Google, Apple, and Amazon in the mobile and cloud platform markets. Nonetheless, Nadella's forward-thinking strategies are arguably superior to the complacent tactics that came before, and could gradually offset Microsoft's outdated dependence on PC sales and licensing fees.

Yes, the search giant will go forward with the Pixel line but it's not the same. Here's the thing - a Nexus is an Android phone, a Pixel is a Google phone. Android is the dominating OS, developed by Google itself, phone manufacturers and even part-time volunteers. And yes, it's closely associated and often tied to Google services. But it doesn't have to be - you can use WhatsApp or Telegram instead of Allo, Bing or DuckDuckGo instead of Search, F-Droid or Amazon's Store instead of Play Store, HERE or OsmAnd instead of Google Maps and so on. There are many alternatives - both commercial and open source - that both users and phone manufacturers could choose between. For example, before Google Maps used offline storage, Samsung put HERE Maps on its phones and let you download maps to the whole world for free. Android could be anything you want it to be, the Pixels can only be Google phones. Google wants you to use its services, same as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. This works great for Apple, okay for Amazon and not at all for Microsoft. Could Google succeed in being a premium company? Because the hacker-friendly attitude wasn't even the best part of the Nexus line - the Nexus 4 was a flagship for very little money (it was $200 at one point!). The Nexus 5, which had features even the Pixels lack, launched at $350 and got several price cuts later. True, the Nexus 6 went premium at $650, but it was a 6" phone with stereo speakers, OIS, wireless charging and some water resistance at the same price as the small Pixel. Will you miss the affordable flagship Nexus? Or the high-end Nexus with reliable software upgrades and great potential for customization? Or is a Google phone what you really wanted? The Nexus line is dead, will you miss it? Farewell old friend, the Android world is worse off without you The Pixels are the pure Google experience I always wanted Poll Maker Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

Obama and Romney unleashed a wealth of insults at one another on a range of issues, from pensions to the Benghazi attacks, and the public reacted instantly to these insults on Google and social media. Whether Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be able to rival Obama and Romney's words remains to be seen, but here's five of Obama and Romney's best moments in the week of the second debate: 1. Romney's "Binders Full of Women" When an undecided young woman voter asked Obama and Romney how they plan to rectify wage inequality in the workplace, Romney thought he could go in for the kill and show women he cared. He explained that he was surprised to find men occupying cabinet positions and asked his staff if they could find women who were equally qualified for them. "I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' And they brought us whole binders full of women," Romney said to prove he had taken a "concerted effort" to find qualified women. Within minutes of his speech, a Tumblr parody was created, #bindersfullofwomen became a trending Twitter hashtag and the phrase was the second-highest Google search term during the debate. 2. Obama on Pension: "It's Not As Big As Yours" Romney sparred with Obama over unfair trading practices in China, and admitted to having invested in Chinese firms. But he then confronted Obama and asked him repeatedly if he had looked at his own pension. "You know, I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long. I don't check it that often," Obama responded to Romney's line of questioning. While Romney thought he got a leg up by accusing Obama of having investments in China and the Cayman Islands, the real winner online was the president. His response was the top searched Google query during the debate, particularly in Virginia, New Jersey, Ohio and Illinois. 3. Obama's Remarks in the Rose Garden On September 12, 2012 in the Rose Garden, President Obama announced the deaths of four Americans killed during the attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, including that of Chris Stevens, American ambassador to Libya. During his remarks, Obama called their deaths "an act of terror." Later in the second debate, Romney accused Obama of waiting 14 days to officially declare the Benghazi siege a "terror-based" attack during the second presidential debate, forcing Obama to re-read the transcript of his original announcement that day. The tension between Romney and Obama over Obama's remarks in the debate made it Google's third most searched query during that week. 4. Obama on Romney: "He Has Romnesia" During a campaign stop at George Mason University after the second debate, Obama mocked Romney's indecisiveness and labeled it "Romnesia." "If you say you're for equal pay for equal work, but you keep refusing to say whether or not you'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work — you might have Romnesia," Obama said, criticizing Romney's shifting stances on women's rights, healthcare, equal pay and tax cuts. By the evening of Oct. 19, the world was having a serious case of Romnesia and it became the top Google search the following day. 5. Alfred E. Smith Dinner Two days after the second debate, Obama and Romney traded barbs at the Al Smith Dinner in New York City. Obama made fun of his own widely-panned first debate performance and reminded the crowd that "he got Bin Laden." Romney, on the other hand, poked fun at the media and told Obama "he has Bill Clinton" to help him with his tough campaign, unlike Romney who has his wife, Ann. The "Al Smith Dinner" quickly became a trending hashtag on Twitter and many users said Romney "roasted" himself. #Romney hilarious in roast of himself, #Obama at #AlSmithDinner http://t.co/gXkihvh4— K.G.

James Martin/CNET Google Pixel offers cold comfort to silent partner 0 Share: Mobile by Roger Cheng October 5, 2016 9:15 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech The Google Pixel phone was quietly built by HTC.Photo by James Martin/CNET HTC needed a break. It got just that when Google chose the veteran phone manufacturer to produce its newest flagship phones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. The partnership is a testament to strong relationship between Google and HTC, which was also tapped to build the original Android phone, the G1, as well as the first Nexus phone, the Nexus One. That courtesy, however, did not extend to the actual Pixel unveiling. Google never uttered its longtime partner's name during the roughly 90-minute presentation Tuesday. That's the kind of semi-win, semi-loss situation that has come to define HTC. The company has a buzz-worthy product in its Vive virtual-reality headset, but its core phone business has struggled. It builds beautifully designed products, but they're often ignored. As a result, the HTC name sits on the periphery of consumer awareness. You might have recognized it once and even coveted one of its phones at one point, but it's a faded memory. So will the Pixel partnership get folks looking at HTC again? Probably not. HTC was just happy to have a part in one of the highest-profile phones of the year. "We're proud that when Google needed an industry-leading partner for the Pixel, HTC was the clear answer," said HTC spokesman Jeff Gordon. Google, meanwhile, emphasized the role it played in developing the Pixel. "There is no HTC branding because this is a Google phone that brings together premium hardware by multiple partners to serve a best in class software experience for users," said a company spokesman. More from Google's event Google Pixel phones, Daydream View and Chromecast Ultra: Everything Google just announced Google's Pixel, Pixel XL are superphones set to take on iPhone 7 Pixel hardware event is really about software See all of our Google coverage The deal to be a silent partner hearkens back to HTC's early days as a contract manufacturer, when it built phones for companies like Hewlett-Packard and Palm, which would slap on their own logos. "HTC started out as an original device manufacturer, so this is partly the company returning to its roots," said Avi Greengart, who covers consumer products for Consumer Analysis. Not content to let others take the credit, HTC launched its own brand in 2009 with a global marketing campaign. By 2012, it was the fourth-largest smartphone maker in the world, according to IDC. Today, it's been shunted into the "other" category, too small to warrant individual mention. As such, industry observers see the deal as a slight positive only because Google is throwing some manufacturing business at HTC. It's just the latest product the company has built with better-known partners. It developed the Vive headset in cooperation with video game software maker Valve, and it has built a family of connected health-tracking devices for clothing maker Under Armour. Few lasting benefits It's unlikely you're going to wake up today and realize you want an HTC phone. At least with Google's previous strategy of building Nexus phones, partners like HTC or LG could share in the buzz that comes from a phone with the latest version of Android. Google would talk up its partners during the product unveiling. By moving to the Pixel brand, the search titan is sending a message to consumers and partners alike that this is the first true Google phone. HTC will get minimal recognition, if any. The HTC 10 did not resonate with consumers. Photo by CNET "It's way too inside baseball -- most consumers have never heard of HTC, and even fewer will know that Pixel is made by HTC," Greengart said. HTC's own flagship One series has floundered, including this year's HTC 10. Meanwhile, the company's revenue dropped amid continued losses in the second quarter. While the extra business will help HTC's bottom line, it isn't sustainable, according to IDC analyst Ramon Llamas. Google has traditionally hopped from one partner to another and could do the same with the next Pixel phone. Llamas took it a step further, questioning whether the Nexus program offered enough tangible benefits to any of its partners. While Nexus phones drew a lot of buzz from the hardcore Android crowd, mainstream consumers have gravitated towards Android phones from the likes of Samsung and LG. The situation is likely even worse now with the Pixel. "I don't see anyone getting much of a halo effect from being the manufacturer of Google's devices," he said. That's little comfort to one of Google's oldest partners.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: Alexa takes round 1 0 Share: Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart November 9, 2016 9:35 AM PST @GebAndrew Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Editors' note, November 9th, 2016: This piece has been updated now that we've reviewed Google Home and can directly compare the two devices. Given the surprising success of the Amazon Echo -- a smart speaker that responds to your voice commands, plays music, and controls your smart home -- competition was inevitable. With Google Home entering the arena, complete with the backing of the company's ubiquitous search engine, the Echo's place on top is no longer secure. Google Home can do almost anything... except beat Amazon Echo The wait is over. Time to see if Google Home lives up to the hype. by Andrew Gebhart 3:42 Close Drag Now, we've had more than a week to test Google Home and we have full rated reviews of both it and the Echo. Like the Echo, the Home functions as a source of entertainment, a personal assistant, and a smart home controller. You can buy the Home now for $130. The Echo costs $180. You can also get Amazon's assistant Alexa in a smaller package that you can plug into your own sound system -- called the Amazon Echo Dot for $50. Before we tested the Home, I expected it to win as an entertainer and a personal assistant, and I expected Alexa to win as a smart home controller. Let's see if that holds true. Google Home vs. Amazon Echo Google Home Amazon Echo Price $130 $180 Responds to voice commands Yes Yes Always listening Yes Yes Wake word OK, Google Alexa, Echo, or Amazon Music streaming options Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn Amazon Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, others Smart home partnerships Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, IFTTT Nest, Ecobee, SmartThings, Wink, Insteon, Belkin WeMo, Philips Hue, Lifx, Big Ass Fans, IFTTT, other devices via "skills" Customizable appearance Yes No Output to stereo system Yes, via Chromecast No (yes with Amazon Dot) Synced audio playback to multiple devices Yes, to any Google Cast device No Personal assistant highlights Search Google, get a personalized daily briefing, check traffic, check your calendar, make a shopping list, check flight status, track a package Add items to calendar, make a shopping list, make a to do list, check flight status, track a package Other features Cast to your TV with Chromecast, launch and control YouTube via Chromecast Order a pizza, play a game, arrange an Uber pickup. Echo has an ever-growing list of 900+ skills and counting Entertainment The Amazon Echo and the Google Home are both always listening due to their built-in microphones that can hear voice input from a moderate distance. The Echo wakes up to the command "Alexa" or you can change the wake word to "Echo." The Home listens for either "Okay Google" or "Hey Google." Both do a fine job of hearing you even across a large room and over moderate background noise. If you turn the volume all the way up on your music, both will understandably have trouble picking your voice out of the racket. Giving Google Home an ear exam Can Google Home hear you over background music? I pit it against Amazon Echo and turn up the volume to find out. by Andrew Gebhart 1:29 Close Drag As speakers, both function well enough for listening to music. Though neither lived up to the standards of CNET's audiophiles. Check out Ty Pendlebury's detailed breakdown of how the Home does vs the Echo as far as sound quality. In short, he recommends that if you're looking strictly for a Bluetooth speaker -- keeping looking. On the plus side, both offer ways of connecting to your existing sound system. The mini version of the Echo -- the Amazon Echo Dot -- plugs into your speakers. With the Home, you can control any Google Cast enabled speaker or any speaker connected to a Chromecast Audio streamer. Bonus points for the Home: you can also control your TV if you have a Chromecast video streamer. Currently, you can only use the Home's controls on Youtube, and you have to pull up specific videos by name or a group of videos like "trending" or "popular." Supposedly, the Home will work with Netflix and Google Images soon, so then it'll be more useful. Right now, it's a cool idea that's not that helpful in reality. Home's built-in speaker plays music well enough for me, but the sound quality didn't satisfy our audiophiles.Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Alexa does have some TV integration as well if you have a Fire TV, but you need to press a button on a specific Fire TV remote, so the always listening the Echo can't help you with your TV yet through first party support. That said, it can go above and beyond what Home can do right now if you have a Logitech Harmony setup, including turning your TV on and off and changing the channel. The Home's integration with Chromecast can't do any of that, but a Chromecast streamer is $35, and a Logitech setup costs hundreds of dollars. Plus, with the Home, you can group multiple speakers and play one song simultaneously in multiple rooms of your house. Both the Home and Alexa play games, tell jokes, and respond wittily to movie lines like "I am your father." Alexa's been around for longer, so the Amazon assistant has many more fun extras than Google Home. Alexa can lead you on a choose-your-own-adventure-style Batman game. Alexa's Jeopardy game is also much better than Home's simplistic and over-the-top trivia. Still, I'm giving this category to the Home because extras aside, the Home's ability to group your speakers and cheaply control your TV makes it wonderfully useful as a whole home entertainer, even if that TV integration isn't all that useful at the moment. Verdict: Google Home wins entertainment Personal Assistant Google Home learns more about you through a variety of Google services -- Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Maps, so I expected it to easily beat Alexa in this category. Not only can the Home tell you about the appointments on your calendar, it can tell you about traffic on your way to work in the morning. Plus, the Home uses Google Assistant to respond to voice commands conversationally. Debuted on the company's new Pixel phones, Google made a big show of the assistant's ability to learn from your questions when the company first showed off Google Home back in May. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do In other words, you can ask Google Home "Who plays Luke Skywalker?" Thanks to the Google Assistant, the Home will give you an answer. Then, you can follow that question with "What other movies is he in?" The Home will infer the "he" you're referring to is the actor Mark Hamill and still provide an answer. The Home doesn't let you change anything on your calendar yet. It also doesn't integrate with Gmail or Google docs. It won't tell you directions or send directions to your phone. And you can make a shopping list that'll show up in Google Keep, but you can't make any other type of list yet or even set reminders. The Home's integration with Google services didn't actually prove all that helpful in my testing, at least not yet. As for the conversational awareness, it's a neat trick, but the Home only understands limited context for now, and surprisingly, Alexa kept up with the Home on this front. We asked Alexa to tell us the weather. Then, we asked, "How about Friday?" and Alexa understood and responded without needing to hear the word "weather" again. Conversations with Google Home A quick look at Home's conversational capabilities vs the Echo and Alexa. by Andrew Gebhart 1:06 Close Drag The Home understands a little more context, but not much more. Alexa also lets you set reminders and make to do lists. And the clincher -- Alexa has immense third party support and more than 3,000 skills, which are essentially apps for your Echo. Thanks to those skills, and the fact that Alexa keeps up pretty well with Google Home in contextual awareness, it wins the upset victory in this category. Though, once the Home gets a few updates and a few more integrations with other Google services, this category could easily shift to the Home in the future. Verdict: Amazon Echo wins as a personal assistant Smart home controller Speaking of those 3,000 skills, with Alexa's two year head start in building a catalog of compatible smart home devices, and given that Google Home launched with just four -- SmartThings, Nest, Philips Hue, and IFTTT -- I didn't think the Home would be able to keep up with the Amazon Echo in this important category. 15 Everything that will work with Google Home An always-listening device makes it much easier for a family to control the smart home. We found that out first hand in the CNET Smart Home, and it's a big part of why Alexa is a central part of our living lab for testing connected gadgets. We did that before the Home existed, though, and the Home puts up an admirable fight for smart home supremacy. For one, Home responds more flexibly to commands than Alexa. Both the Home and Alexa pull device names from their respective first party apps -- so the Philips Hue app for Philips bulbs. With Alexa, you can create named groups for your devices. With the Home, you can give them nicknames and group them into rooms. For a bulb called "desk lamp" in the Philips app, Alexa will only respond if you tell it to turn on the "desk lamp." You can create a group for all lights or office lights, then command Alexa to turn off the office lights and it'll work. Without those groups though, Alexa won't respond to any other names for the lamp, including "desk light." With Google Home, I nicknamed the desk lamp "Lampy," and assigned it to the office. I could then control it by commanding Google to turn on the "desk lamp," "lampy," "desk light," "office light," or "lights." Google doesn't get any extra credit for the "office light" command since assigning the lamp to the room is similar to adding it to a group for Alexa, but I appreciated the Home automatically grouping it with the rest of my lights and helping me out with the difference between "light" and "lamp." Google Home fit into our smart home nicely. The changeable bases helped us find the perfect look.Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Google's integrations with IFTTT and Philips Hue are also better than Alexa's. With the Home, you can control the colors of your Philips bulbs. You can't do that with Alexa right now. With IFTTT -- the online rule maker that stands for "If This Then That" -- the Home lets you craft fully customizable commands including multiple options for how you might want to say the command. You have to use the word "trigger" to activate a customizable command with Alexa. For example, with the Home, I was able to create a rule that allowed me to say "I'm leaving," "I'm out," or "Switch Ecobee to away mode." Home would respond to each of these and switch modes for my Ecobee3 thermostat. You can create the same rule with Alexa, but you'd have to say something like "Alexa, trigger Ecobee to away mode." The Home's flexible phrasing could eventually make it better for the smart home than Alexa, as the other members of your family don't have to memorize as many exact commands to control your devices. For now, Alexa's sheer number of skills keeps it on top of this contest, but Google Home makes the battle much closer than I thought it would be. Verdict: Amazon Echo wins as a smart home controller Final count For now, the Amazon Echo beats the Google Home 2-1 and wins the battle in this exciting new category of devices. Undoubtedly, although this first battle is won, the competition is far from over. The Home will integrate with more smart home platforms, more Google services, and get better and better at understanding context as a conversational assistant. Just don't expect Alexa to sit idly by as Google Home improves. For consumers, the competition can only be a good thing. Hopefully, the Home pushes Alexa to be more conversational and Alexa pushes the Home to aggressively pursue third party support. With Apple reportedly also developing a similar device, one thing's for sure: the game is on.

The apparent golden age of digital marketing let travel brands focus solely on two things: optimising pages based on their content, so they could appear as high as possible in natural search results; and bidding against competitors on keywords so that their text ads would appear on the right-hand side of the organic results. This period actually lasted a fairly long time, at least in web terms, but things started to change at the turn of the decade. A flurry of additions to SERPS (search engine results pages), especially on travel-related search queries, saw the appearance of elements such as maps, local information, images, videos and Wikipedia data. And then came Google’s own services, such as modules for Google Flight Search and Hotel Finder. Later items include Twitter cards, Google News-sourced articles and the Knowledge Graph. Google’s search results pages, in short, have changed dramatically (albeit gradually) from how they looked half a decade ago. Digital marketing software provider SearchMetrics recently analysed page one of Google SERPS for half a million frequently searched terms to understand how much the real estate has changed. One of the top-line findings is that the number of organic links displayed on page one has fallen from the original ten to around 8.5, with the real estate taken up with other modules and items. In addition, almost every search query now produces at least one related image, video, Twitter card, or news item. But SearchMetrics found there are some major differences in how SERPS work on desktop and mobile devices. EMEA marketing director, Lars Hartkopf, says: “Gone are the days when optimising for search was all about trying to appear in the classic ten blue organic links on Google’s first page. “Now marketers must also plan their strategies to include opportunities around a variety of Universal and Extended Search boxes, understanding how to create and optimise content which Google will consider useful for each.” So, what can digital marketers do about it? SearchMetrics came up with five areas to look at: 1. Integration boxes Google is probably trying to discourage image-laden pages with long download times (often a key feature of travel websites), so is less likely to feature them in organic results. Mobile results also include more Google Maps and Twitter Card integrations but fewer Product Listing Ads integrations related to search queries. Marketers, therefore, should make sure they strike a balance between content types and fully understand the impact of that strategy in SERPS. 2. App suggestions On mobile searches, Google often integrates what is known as an App Pack box, essentially to show different smartphone apps that are available in the respective Apple of Google app stores that are related to the search query. Marketers need to ensure that their own application is optimised to appear (using known techniques) in those packs. It’s a virtuous circle, too – the more downloads, the higher the chance that Google will feature it the pack. 3. Video boxes With around a quarter of search results featuring at least one featured video (nine out of ten, inevitably, coming via Google-owned YouTube), travel marketers have to ensure they do a lot more than produce clips. To boost the chance of a video being featured against a search term, creators must ensure they include the relevant and optimised descriptions and tags, as well as selecting a thumbnail for the static image and, as has been seen more recently, subtitles. 4. Knowledge Graph These modules are hugely important for travel brands, mainly as they appear frequently against search terms relating to destinations and attractions within a location. Google obtains the information from various online sources, allowing known brands to have some influence on what appears when users carry out a search. Such information includes logos/images, social network profiles and contact information. Another frequently integrated module is from Wikipedia, although SearchMetrics notes that officially this is a web user-generated page and supposedly hard to control. 5. Direct Answer boxes These often appear when a user fires up a query that includes the words “how” or “what”. Well-placed above organic listings, results are known to generate a fair amount of organic traffic to a website. Securing a spot there is harder, with content needing to be optimised, resting on a high authority site (page rank) and structured using specific web code.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

Actually, the development of SERP can be regarded both as a challenge and as an opportunity for travel related website owners. Researches show that for example in Direct Answers you can find information (and a link of course) from a website rather far down from the top organic positions. Therefore, it cannot be said that on-page optimization as a part of your SEO efforts is no longer needed. Only properly structured and optimized information can get to the boxes in vertical search results. The same can be applied to images and videos: webmaster will need to know how to use all the image attributes correctly so it will appear in images section of the SERP for the relevant keywords, and have their video pages optimized too. Now all the types of the content are to be considered (images, videos, social media profile updates etc), all the types of data presentation (tables, lists etc) to cover the most of the blocks presented on the SERP.

It supports more than 800 languages and 100 writing scripts. Noto is a massive undertaking, but one deemed necessary by Google. It's been working on the project over the past five years in collaboration with Monotype in hopes of eradicating so-called "tofu"—the blank boxes you see when a PC or website can't display a particular text—from the web. Noto, or No more tofu, is Google's answer and it's available now to download. "The Noto project started as a necessity for Google’s Android and ChromeOS operating systems. When we began, we did not realize the enormity of the challenge. It required design and technical testing in hundreds of languages, and expertise from specialists in specific scripts," Google explains in a blog post. "In Arabic, for example, each character has four glyphs (i.e., shapes a character can take) that change depending on the text that comes after it. In Indic languages, glyphs may be reordered or even split into two depending on the surrounding text." Solving the challenge meant partnering with various experts in type and font design. Monotype played the biggest role, though Google also collaborated with Adobe and had a network of volunteer reviewers. As far as Monotype is concerned, Noto is one of the expansive typography projects ever undertaken. "We are passionately dedicated to type and helping to advance the use and adoption of type across many cultures, languages and geographies. We are thrilled to have played such an important role in what has become one of the most significant type projects of all time," said Scott Landers, president and CEO of Monotype. "The combination of Monotype’s type expertise and Google’s innovation has proven to be a productive relationship and we look forward to continued collaboration that helps advance the use of type to new places." Noto fonts are available in eight weights. A whopping 110,000 characters comprise the entire set, and in an effort to keep consistent with Unicode, Google will update Noto as new characters are introduced to it. That includes the recent emoji additions. You can download all the Noto fonts here.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google Removes AdSense Ad Limit Policy: Reasons Behind the Change Digital Advertising  News August 24, 2016 Digital Advertising News Matt SouthernAugust 24, 2016 SEJ STAFF 829SHARES 4.8KREADS 829SHARES 4.8KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 829SHARES 4.8KREADS Google recently refreshed its AdSense ad limit policy, removing the restriction it once had on the amount of ads publishers can place on one page. Old Policy vs. New Policy Using the WayBack Machine, you can see that the policy once read as follows: “Currently, on each page AdSense publishers may place: – Up to three AdSense for content units – Up to three link units – Up to two search boxes Publishers may not place more than one “large” ad unit per page. We define a “large” ad unit as any unit similar in size to our 300×600 format. For example, this would include our 300×1050 and 970×250 formats, our 750×200 and 580×400 regional formats, and any other custom sized ad with comparable dimensions.” Now, you can see in Google’s current ad placement policies that the ‘ad limit per page’ section has been removed. It has been replaced with a section titled ‘valuable inventory’, which cautions site owners not to let the amount of ads on a page exceed the amount of actual content. Doing so may result in Google limiting or disabling ads served on the page until appropriate changes are made. I spoke with a Google representative this afternoon who confirmed the ad limit has been removed. Reasons Behind the Removal of Google’s AdSense Ad Limit Google’s previous ad limit policy was in effect for many years — in fact, the company has not updated it since the rise of mobile. Improving Web Content The primary reason behind this change is to create a better balance between quality content and advertising. Rather than looking at this change as a cap that has been removed, it should be looked at as a way to improve the overall quality of content on the web. One of the ways many publishers have been getting around the ad limit is to break content down into multiple pages using slideshows. Removing the limit on the amount of ads that can be placed on one page will hopefully lead to less slideshow-based content, and more high quality content. Encouraging Publishers to Test New Ad Units To coincide with the rise of mobile, Google introduced new mobile-friendly ad units. However,  publishers are hesitant to test the new ad units because they don’t want to give up any ad units that are currently in place. If publishers remove one of the ad units they’re currently using it could potentially lead to a loss in revenue. Realizing this, Google made the decision to rethink the ad limit policy in hopes that more publishers will begin using the new mobile-friendly ads. Keeping Advertisers Happy Companies that are paying to advertise via mobile-friendly ad units are not receiving a maximum return on investment if publishers are not utilizing the ads. Publishers are a critical component of advertising; if publishers don’t display the ads then companies will be less likely to pay for advertising. Google sees this change as more of a partnership with its publishers, allowing them to further monetize their content while keeping advertisers happy at the same time. Will Publishers Go Overboard With Ads? Now that there is no defined limit on the amount of ads that can be placed on a single page, is there a concern that publishers may start to abuse their advertising privileges? It’s still in a publisher’s best interest not to go overboard with ads, because it would degrade the user experience. If visitors are inundated with too many ads it could lead to them abandoning the web page, which would in turn affect a publisher’s ability to monetize. Although there is no longer an exact limit on the amount of ads that can be used on a page, there still has to be a suitable balance between ads and original content. Using an excessive amount of ads can still lead to a violation of Google’s ad implementation policies, which will result in Google either limiting or disabling a publisher’s ads.

 Here's what Wall Street is saying after Google's big hardware event Avery Hartmans Oct. 5, 2016, 10:52 AM 7,538 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai Reuters/Stephen Lam Wall Street was impressed by Tuesday's big Google event, which unveiled new hardware such as the Pixel phone and the Google Home device, and launched the company's new artificial intelligence Assistant on several new devices. The company's stock has remained stable since then — it's up slightly, about 0.46% as of 10 a.m. Wednesday — but analysts say the new products are a good sign for Google, even though it appears to be following in the footsteps of other, more accomplished hardware companies such as Apple and Amazon. Here's what Wall Street analysts had to say: Macquarie Macquarie remains bullish on Google, affirming its "outperform" rating and setting a price target of $975. It describes Google's new products as "me too" — meaning it's showing up to the game a bit late, after Apple has mastered the smartphone and Amazon has dominated the AI device market with Alexa and the Echo. While Macquarie thinks Google's voice recognition capabilities could be what sets the Assistant and Google Home apart from the competition, it's taking a conservative view on the new products: "GOOG's past attempts at hardware (Nexus, Chromebooks, Glass, Nest, etc...) have not amounted to much and given their track record, we are not going to give them the benefit of the doubt on any hardware efforts until we see otherwise. The bottom line is the VR and AI capabilities shown are interesting but we don't see much hardware here that's particularly innovative versus what's currently in the market. We think this is particularly disappointing given GOOG's focus on R&D, virtually unlimited resources and unique capabilities." All the new products unveiled at Google's October 4 event. Skye Gould/Business Insider Jefferies According to Jefferies, Google just introduced "some of its most interesting hardware devices yet." Jefferies' price target is on the higher end — $1,000 — and it's maintaining a "buy" rating. Perhaps most interestingly, Jefferies is taking a very bullish stance on Google Home. Analysts estimated the market for virtual assistants could reach $2.1 billion by 2017, and Jefferies says Google Home has the potential to add $500 million in revenue for Google by then. Baird Equity Research Baird set one of the more conservative price targets, at $900, and rates Google's stock at "outperform." But Baird is betting most on machine learning and AI as the key to Google's success down the line. Here's what Baird's analysts wrote: "As AI/Machine Learning emerge as the next 'computing wave,' Google's virtual assistant sits at the core of both Pixel and Home, and showcase the focus at the intersection of hardware and software. We continue to believe that Google's ML/AI capabilities are a key competitive differentiator, often overlooked by investors." Though Baird describes AI as still in the "early innings," it says Google's machine-learning capabilities can only get better — Baird expects voice recognition, machine translation, and image recognition to vastly improve over time.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAmazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Amazon’s Plans to Beat Google in Its own Turf (AMZN, GOOG) Not satisfied being the dominating force in the e-commerce industry, Amazon is now challenging Google in its own turf. October 9, 2016 WSP Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) exponential growth has been giving rivals sleepless nights but the e-commerce titan is not done dominating one industry after another. Next on the company’s hit list? Google. In a feature by The Wall Street Journal, Amazon has been slowly making a presence in the digital advertising business and though the move is in its infancy, the online retailer is using its 63 million strong Prime members as leverage to win over advertisers. According to news source, Amazon’s ad business is pretty basic, focusing more on driving online sales using sponsored ads anywhere online or through Amazon’s online store but it won’t be long before the e-commerce powerhouse will use its culled data to attract more marketers. For one thing, Amazon can make any partner brands look good to customers, scoring targeted sales. The Seattle-based company could also provide more exposure to its marketers’ products to boost sales. Market research firm eMarketer has predicted that in 2017, Amazon’s ad business will grow to an impressive 9.4%, generating about 1 billion in online revenue in the US alone. But with Amazon’s North American division’s 28% growth in the second quarter and a harder push for sponsored listings on its website and app, there’s the real possibility that Amazon’s ad campaign will exceed the market’s expectation. Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of the digital ad agency “Deep Focus” said Amazon culled so much data that it’s anyone’s guess how it will be used and for how long since the company implements strict rules on how its data is used outside of its shopping platform. Now the question is, will Amazon’s entry in the ad segment pose a threat to Google’s lead position? That will depend really on how hard Amazon wants to push in its ad rivalry against Google. That said, the e-commerce firm has yet to lay out a plan in terms of expanding its own digital marketing campaign. Additionally, there’s no way to say if Amazon will be in it for long-term since the company has a lot on its plate. Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains unfazed over Amazon’s entry into an industry the search giant  has dominated for years. The Alphabet Inc.-owned conglomerate is betting big on its own shopping platform, an e-commerce channel that will feature sponsored products with images linked within Google’s own search results and shopping site. These ads are the same ones that eBay, Wal-Mart, Target and other online retailers use, with the exemption of Amazon. This means there’s plenty of opportunity for Google to cement its leading position in the industry. Curiously, Amazon is keeping its new business under wraps and it’s hard to guess the company’s level of commitment to the initiative. Although the online retailer remains a minor player in the ad marketing segment, Amazon may give Google – along with the industry’s number 2. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) – a real competition as long as it plays its cards right.

(Eric Risberg/Associated Press) By Mark Bergen and Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Published: October 9, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Google unveiled new hardware from smartphones and smart speakers to wireless routers on Tuesday. It was a year-long odyssey that involved design, supply chain negotiations and the search for a manufacturing partner. Now the Alphabet Inc. unit must grapple with the equally daunting challenge of getting the gadgets to consumers. It has a history of retail strategies that either struggled or never got off the ground, according to people familiar with the company’s retail efforts. What’s more, it’s inexperienced dealing with returns and recycling. And unlike rival Apple Inc., the company lacks its own stores where it can showcase hardware as it pleases and instead relies on other companies’ in-store displays. This time, the stakes are higher because the latest gadgets are vehicles for Google’s digital assistant, a key product that is chasing Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. “We view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors. Google is selling the new Pixel phones at Verizon Communications and Best Buy stores in the U.S., via its own online store, a temporary physical store in New York City and through its wireless service Project Fi. It’s working with a small number of other wireless carriers and retailers in countries including Germany and India. Google Home, the new speaker, is available at Best Buy, Wal-Mart Stores and Target stores, in addition to Google’s online store. Cutting distribution deals with a handful of carriers and retailers isn’t enough, according to Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Google will have to up its customer-service game and do many more distribution partnerships,” he said. Many of Google’s past efforts at selling hardware have fizzled. When the company started its Nexus brand in 2010 it planned to market the phones online only, but sales never took off. About 200,000 of the first Nexus model sold, short of Google’s target of several million units, according to a person who worked on the device. Then there was Android Silver. Kicked off some time in 2014, the internal project was designed to sell high-end Android handsets with partners to compete with Apple. Google set up a retail lab for the effort, claiming an entire building near its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters, according to former employees. But it never got off the ground. Nikesh Arora, Google’s sales chief at the time, drove the initiative. When he left in July 2014, Android Silver was shelved. One former Google executive called it a boondoggle. The former Googlers didn’t want to be identified discussing private information. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Such experiments are a contrast to Apple stores that are the envy of the retail industry. Apple considers the iPhone in terms of the product’s complete life cycle, from leaving the factory to when customers stop using the device. Apple offers a recycling program through physical and online stores. Google’s new smartphone unit approached potential wireless carrier partners early this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Some carriers peppered Google executives with questions about handling phone returns and technical support, the person said. At the time, Google did not appear ready to take on these aspects of the phone hardware business, according to this person. A ‘Journey’ Google executives on the hardware team say the company is on a “journey,” gaining experience and capabilities with each smartphone generation. And Apple only began touting the iPhone’s full life cycle after a few generations. On Tuesday, as a Google event began in San Francisco, new hardware chief Rick Osterloh reassured the audience that the company was serious about the move. “We’re in it for the long run,” he said. About nine months after initial talks with carriers, Google rolled out its flavor of technical support: Pixels have built-in chat support where customer-service reps can take over smartphone screens to identify problems. Google will be responsible for returns and recycling and is building a supply chain that can re-absorb faulty and rejected devices, Osterloh said in a recent interview. Osterloh will be partly judged by how many devices Google sells, a contrast to the Nexus program which showcased Android features for other handset makers to adopt. But the executive was still cagey about the company’s sales aspirations. “In markets where we do business, we’re definitely going to want meaningful share,” he said. “But it’s highly unlikely that the primary driver will be to be in every market with as high as possible volume.” Google still sees software as its edge, rather than retail distribution and customer service. The company spent more time on Tuesday talking about the digital assistant baked into its new gadgets, and how they work together. If Google can get millions of people relying on its assistant, the company may be able to compete with Apple’s devices, according to Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner. “The AI assistant will give them something that Apple has enjoyed for many years: Lock-in to the system,” he said.

Tech heavyweights race for artificial intelligence edge Technology Sunday 9 October 2016 - 12:29pm File: Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. Photo: Flickr.com/Jhaymesisviphotography SAN FRANCISCO - Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets - aiming to outdo Apple's Siri - enabling users to organise and use information on the devices and in the cloud - to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort to provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. READ: iPhone 7 coming 14 October Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana - a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" - responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers.

The Mountain View company's upcoming physical location is expected to feature a bunch of new hardware that it has in the pipeline, including the Google Pixel line of mobile devices. The pop-up will open its doors on Oct. 20, Thursday, which is the same day the Google Pixel and Pixel XL will be available on retailers' shelves. Moreover, with the Made by Google branding, the pop-up will go beyond just the mobile device. Bear in mind that aside from the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google also introduced a handful of other products during an event held Tuesday, Oct. 4. The list includes the Daydream View virtual reality headset, the Google Home smart speaker that has a lot of similarities with Amazon Echo, the Chromecast Ultra, which supports 4K HDR streaming, and the Google Wifi, which can form a mesh of networks using multiple routers. But it's not just the latest products. Their predecessors will also be featured in the pop-up. For instance, the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. It is unknown whether other Google devices will find their way to the pop-up's shelves, as Google is yet to hint at other devices aside from the mentioned ones. However, the Made by Google pop-up should not be expected to be a purchase point for the mentioned devices or any device from Google for that matter. Rather, the pop-up will open its doors to give consumers the "experience" and have them try out the company's product offerings. Aside from the Spring Street location, Google has not specified any other venues. But granted that this one becomes successful, it may lead the Mountain View company to open Google experience centers in other key locations within the country. Having such physical locations to host product demos and provide users the chance to try out its latest wares can play out well for Google and its future product releases. More than any of Google's other recently introduced products, consumers are likely to line up for the Google Pixel smartphone and Pixel XL phablet. Aside from the awesome ad, both devices will come out of the box with Android 7.1 Nougat on board. They'll also sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, which Qualcomm claims will deliver 10 percent more performance over the Snapdragon 820. This should be plenty when coupled with 4 GB of RAM on the two devices. And yes, they both come with fast charging and 3.5mm headphone jack.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) SAN FRANCISCO • There’s a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here’s a tourist’s guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard Co. was founded in a Palo Alto, Calif., garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Avenue, considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple’s first computer in the home of Jobs’ parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs’ sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world’s dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, Calif., house, at 232 Santa Margarita Avenue, is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn’t been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, Calif., house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg’s magic will rub off on them. Today’s technology temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture’s lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn’t mean you can’t steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, Calif., campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company’s employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorializing different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world’s smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes “Cupcake,” “Donut,” “Eclair,” “Froyo,” “Gingerbread,” Honeycomb,” “Ice Cream Sandwich,” “Jelly Bean,” “KitKat,” “Lollipop” and “Marshmallow.” The latest serving of Android, called “Nougat,” has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook’s symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won’t be able to see what’s on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a 9-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can’t get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You’ll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple’s customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2,” the new building is designed to accommodate about 12,000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7,000 trees. What about the house on TV? The HBO comedy “Silicon Valley” has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn’t exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Android 7.1 Nougat Changelog – Here’s What You Can Expect from It By Uzair Ghani Posted 1 month ago 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Here’s the full Android 7.1 Nougat changelog outlining Pixel, Pixel XL-exclusive features and what non-Pixel users can expect from it. The Complete Android 7.1 Nougat Changelog Is Here, but Don’t Expect Too Much If You’re a Non-Pixel User The Google Pixel and Pixel XL handsets will run Nougat out of the box. But it’s not off the shelf version of the software that’s available publicly, it’s version 7.1 in fact, as revealed during Google’s October 4 keynote. It’s tailor-made with new devices in mind and come packed with a load of exclusive features as well. Luckily though, the entire Android 7.1 Nougat update itself isn’t going to be exclusive to just the latest Pixel handsets. It will eventually roll out to other devices too, including the Nexus lineup. But, certain features of the software will stay exclusive to Pixel handsets, and there’s no telling whether or not these additions will make it onto other devices. So, if you do get the update, what can you expect from it? We have stumbled upon the complete Android 7.1 changelog, courtesy of AndroidPolice, that highlights Pixel-exclusvie features as well as those that will aimed towards users with non-Pixel phones. Pixel product-specific Pixel Launcher – swipe up for all apps, new Search Box, date/weather header on home Google Assistant Unlimited original quality photo/video backup to Google Photos Smart Storage – when storage is full, automatically removes old backed up photos/videos Phone/Chat support (new support tab in settings), screen-share functionality Quick switch adapter for wired setup from Android or iPhone Pixel Camera: Electronic Image Stabilization (“video stabilization”) 2.0 Pro Features White Balance Presets Exposure Compensation AE/AF Locking Viewfinder grid modes HW-accelerated (on Qualcomm Hexagon coprocessor) HDR+ image processing Smartburst Sensor Hub processor with tightly integrated sensors (accel, gyro, mag) + connectivity (Wi-Fi, Cell, GPS) Cosmetic Solid navbar icons with home affordance for Assistant SysUI accent color theming Wallpaper picker with new wallpapers and sounds New setup look and feel Dynamic calendar date icon Android Nougat 7.1 Advertisement Night Light Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture – opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager – identifies apps and files and apps using storage As you can see from the changelog, non-Pixel devices can expect the new Night Light feature to grace their devices that works more or less like iOS’ Night Shift mode. Furthermore, users can except touch-screen and display related improvements as well with things topped off Daydream VR mode. Rest of the feature additions are focused mainly towards developers and they look exciting nonetheless. Wrap Up It’s highly likely Android 7.1 Nougat will start rolling out for devices by the end of this year. It also makes sense to keep the software exclusive for Pixel and Pixel XL devices in the weeks to come. After all, there has to be differentiation between Nexus devices and Pixel, right? Once Android 7.1 is available for download, we will inform our readers about it, so stay tuned to our coverage.

On Friday, reports surfaced Disney and Google had bowed out of the discussions. Now, according to a Bloomberg weekend report, the remaining pursuers are also gone: Twitter once saw interest from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Salesforce.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co., all of which consulted with banks on whether to acquire the social-media company. Now all of those suitors are unlikely to make a bid, according to people familiar with the matter. On Friday, Twitter had planned to have a board meeting with outside advisers on a sale but canceled, one of the people said. There’s always a chance that another potential bidder will step up into the mix, but so many interested parties dropping out of the race in so short a time isn’t a good sign. If it’s unable to find a suitor, the company’s fate will instead likely rest in its ability to attract new users by offering live video and other features: If a buyer doesn’t appear, Twitter will to try to appeal to more users through a new strategy that emphasizes live video. The company has been entering partnerships for sports, politics and entertainment content — such as the National Football League’s Thursday night games — that it can stream alongside tweets related to the video. It may give people without Twitter accounts a new way to use the service, while allowing the company to share revenue on the video ads. Twitter’s user growth has ground to a halt in recent years, as its limited features have made the service attractive only to its core audience. Twitter shares closed at $19.85 on Friday, down $0.02 (-0.10%). Year-to-date, TWTR has fallen 14.22%, and is now more than 52% off its IPO day closing price of $41.65.

Mona Lalwani , @monalalwani 10.05.16 in Home Comments 1434 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Image credit: Google Home is the latest embodiment of a virtual assistant. The voice-activated speaker can help you make a dinner reservation, remind you to catch your flight, fire up your favorite playlist and even translate words for you on the fly. While the voice interface is expected to make quotidian tasks easier, it also gives the company unprecedented access to human patterns and preferences that are crucial to the next phase of artificial intelligence. Comparing an AI agent to a personal assistant, as most companies have been doing of late, makes for a powerful metaphor. It is one that is indicative of the human capabilities that most major technology companies want their disembodied helpers to adopt. Over the last couple of years, with improvements in speech-recognition technology, Siri, Cortana and Google Now have slowly learned to move beyond the basics of weather updates to take on more complex responsibilities like managing your calendar or answering your queries. But products that invade our personal spaces -- like Amazon's Echo and Google Home -- point to a larger shift in human-device interaction that is currently underway. Onstage demos of Google Home, which has the company's Assistant built into it, suggest a conversational capability that requires an advanced understanding of human intent and context. The device relies almost entirely on the company's speech-recognition technology that has been in the making for almost a decade, since the early days of GOOG 411. But over the years, the basic telephone-based directory search has grown into the much more complex Google Now. Amazon's Echo ecosystem relies on virtual assistant Alexa to respond to voice commands. The drastic jump in the Android assistant's capabilities has come from neural net training and deep learning techniques that have allowed scientists to boost speech-recognition technology to a point where it is now starting to learn the nuances of human behavior through the medium of voice. Using the voice to communicate with an outside entity makes for an intimate and innately human experience. "Speech is the most dominant way that humanity has been communicating with each other," David Nahamoo, speech CTO at IBM Research, said over the phone. "When we communicate with the outside, we speak. But from outside to inside, we absorb information a lot better visually. It's because of our heritage and the evolution that we have gone through. From the standpoint of efficiency, speech is quickest way to get a point across." "Voice changes the way people interact with their systems." - Françoise Beaufays, Google Devices like Echo and Google Home, for instance, are built on speech recognition that can help you stay heads-up and hands-free while you multitask around the house. So instead of spending time swiping and typing, you can tell the personal assistant what you need or what you're looking for. It's that kind of ease and productivity that companies dangle in front of the users to have them adopt chatbots and personal assistants in their daily communications, but talking to devices also opens the door to a new kind of relationship. "I think voice changes the way people interact with their systems," says Françoise Beaufays, a research scientist who works on speech recognition at Google. "For a long time when people were typing in their browsers for information, they would write something cryptic like 'Eiffel Tower height,' for example." The string of seemingly random words would instantly pull up search results on google.com with pictures, details and dimensions of the iconic French structure. But when speech recognition started to take shape with smartphone assistants, Beaufays says there was a clear change in communication. "As people started feeling comfortable with speech, instead of being cryptic they started saying: 'Hey, what is the height of the Eiffel Tower?' or 'How tall is the Eiffel Tower?'," she says. "We saw that switch in the way people were addressing their devices in speech first and typing next. Using your voice is bringing in more discursive type of interaction, and even though you know very well it's a machine you behave a little more human with it." A still from the movie Her (2013), directed by Spike Jonze. While a verbal exchange with a virtual assistant can make it easier to get things done, it also makes it easier for the companies to gain invaluable insight into the human world that's filled with vocal clues to feelings and preferences. "We're going from computing to understanding," says James Barrat, author of Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era. "It's not just us chatting. These machines are listening to what we like and don't like, how we speak and what we speak about. It's greater access to how we think." In the world of AI, data is the currency that will set one company apart from the other. Through voice searches, millions of vocal samples become available to the companies that are fine-tuning personal assistants. The stream of information is fed back into the system to improve the accuracy of the algorithms, but it also gives the companies access to the complexities of human intent. In effect, using the voice to communicate with an AI helper only makes it smarter. A lot can be gleaned from the vocal communication. Words and intonations start to give away user patterns, preferences and even emotions over time. That kind of insight into the mindset of the user is critical to the next wave of personalized AI that is already taking shape at companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Smart, talking AIs at home will fire up the ecosystem of the Internet of Things, taking it from novelty machines to necessities. With companies aspiring to make their assistants omnipresent and their machines more interconnectable, they need capable speech recognition to get the job done. "There's a parallel thrust," says Vlad Sejnoha, CTO at Nuance Communications, one of the leaders in voice-recognition technologies. "You'll interact with your smart fridge or printer in a more natural way but also see a portable personal assistant that lives in a cloud and follows you around to help you navigate a complex world." Google Home, much like Amazon's Echo, already comes with partnerships that are useful around the house. You can use the speaker to control your Chromecast, Nest and Philips Hue lights. In addition to navigating the immediate physical world, an omnipresent assistant could potentially become a gateway to unfamiliar settings or foreign languages too. In the spot aired during the Google event this week, the company demonstrated that Home has the ability to tap Google Translate to respond with accurate translations from English to Spanish. But whether the machine can comprehend foreign accents and translate the reverse, remains to be seen. "These machines are listening to what we like and don't like, how we speak and what we speak about. It's greater access to how we think." - James Barrat Failing to comprehend different accents has been one of the biggest downfalls of most digital assistants on smartphones today. Scientists building these systems often talk about the lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to understanding new accents and languages. The copious amounts of information required to make that possible calls for massive investments from the companies. Taking the technology straight to people's homes opens up a steady stream of data that can be used for tests back in the research labs. A lot of the building blocks are starting to fall into place for devices like Google Home to become efficient personal assistants. And even though, there's a need to be more vigilant of the ways human-device interactions are starting to shift; most voice interface developers believe it's a necessary change that will extend human capabilities. "Having an AI that is your agent and helps you exist in the world better, gets you better information and services is hugely exciting," says Sejnoha. "As with anything there are uses that can be negative, we're all familiar with privacy and mining data. That's something we have to be thoughtful about, but the benefits far outweigh those scenarios."

Tech giants race for edge in artificial intelligence AFP 09/10/2016 Glenn Chapman © Provided by AFP Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri Major technology firms are racing to infuse smartphones and other internet-linked devices with software smarts that help them think like people. The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. The artificial intelligence (AI) component in these programs aims to make create a world in which everyone can have a virtual aide that gets to know them better with each interaction. Here are some of the offerings available: Google Google is making a high-profile push into AI, with the internet titan's chief referring to it as a force for change as powerful as powerful as smartphones. Google Assistant software is being built into new Pixel handsets -- aiming to outdo Apple's Siri -- enabling users to organize and use information on the devices and in the cloud -- to check emails, stay up to date on calendar appointments, news or ask for traffic and weather data. Google also offers AI through its Allo messaging application which can be installed on smartphones, and its Google Home hub, a standalone device similar to Amazon's Echo which responds to voice commands to manage tasks and fetch information where people live. Samsung © Provided by AFP Samsung moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri The South Korean electronics giant moved to jumpstart its AI efforts by purchasing the US startup Viv Labs, launched by the creators of Apple's Siri. Samsung says the acquisition announced this month is part of its effort o provide AI-based voice assistance services its customers can use across all Samsung devices and products, from smartphones to televisions to washing machines. Samsung is world's leading maker of smartphones powered by Google's free Android software, but also has its own Tizen mobile operating system, so how it may field its own virtual assistant technology remains to be seen. Amazon Amazon in 2014 unveiled its Echo home assistant, a voice-activated speaker, powered by its "Alexa" artificial intelligence program. Users can ask for news or information updates, as well as ordering goods from the online retail giant. Echo also serves as a connected-home hub which can control compatible appliances, lightbulbs and other devices. Since introducing Echo, Amazon has launched a smaller version called "Dot" and integrated Alexa into its Fire TV devices. Microsoft Microsoft's personal assistant uses the name Cortana and is available on Windows devices and its Xbox console and as an application on Apple iOS and Android devices. Unveiled in 2014, Cortana -- a name based on a character in its blockbuster game "Halo" -- responds to conversationally spoken requests or commands, using insights gleaned from calendars, contact lists, online searches and other smartphone sources to respond in a manner akin to a real-life aide. Facebook © Provided by AFP Facebook is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M" Facebook, heavily investing in artificial intelligence, is widely believed to be working on a personal assistant with the codename "M." The social network's founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to create a real-life version of "Jarvis," the assistant in the assistant in the Marvel Comics series "Iron Man." For now, Facebook is enabling AI-powered "bots" on its Messenger mobile application that allows users to get answers to questions and engage in text exchanges as though chatting with the social network itself. Apple Apple was the first to offer its personal assistant, introducing Siri for the iPhone in 2011, and has been working to improve it over the years. Recently, Siri was upgraded to interact with non-Apple applications, so users can book a ride with Lyft or make payments using Square Cash. Apple has also introduced a Home application that can connect with smart appliances and other devices, and is reportedly working on a standalone speaker similar to Amazon Echo and Google Home. IBM Technology stalwart IBM made headlines nearly 20 years ago with "Deep Blue" software that beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov at his own game, and more recently with "Watson" artificial intelligence that triumphed over top human players in a Jeopardy television game show. IBM has put Watson to work making business systems and services smarter with data and customers. Thousands of people are expected to attend a World of Watson conference later this month in Las Vegas.

Skip to content Turkey Blocks Mapping Internet Freedom in Real Time Menu Organization Methodology Press Contact Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive cloud services blocked in Turkey following leaks Posted on October 8, 2016October 16, 2016 by Editorial 5kSHARES ShareTweet Turkey has blocked access to Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive and partially restricted Google Drive cloud file sharing services popular on mobile phones as well as in education, business, legal and press industries, following the leak by hacktivist group Redhack of a set of private emails allegedly belonging to Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At the time of writing, Saturday 8 October, both Google Drive and Dropbox services were issuing SSL errors, indicating intercepted traffic at the national or ISP level. Microsoft OneDrive was also subsequently blocked off throughout Turkey: Microsoft @Onedrive now blocked in #Turkey, joining @GoogleDrive and @Dropbox in nationwide cloud storage shutdownhttps://t.co/xObmf8D00j pic.twitter.com/Kmc8761iH9 — Turkey Blocks (@TurkeyBlocks) October 8, 2016 The BTK authority subsequently released an official block notice for Google Drive, although no such notice was posted for Dropbox: After technical analysis and legal consideration based on the Law Nr. 5651, ADMINISTRATION MEASURE has been taken for this website (drive.google.com) according to Decision Nr.490.05.01.2016.-156393 dated 08/10/2016 implemented by Information and Communication Technologies Authority.BTK / ICTA Affected ISPs include TTNet, UyduNet and Turkcell. Foreign visitors in Turkey using roaming mobile data are still able to access the services because their data is tunnelled to the country of origin. Knock-on effects expected Dropbox Inc, a privately held company whose board of directors includes former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has not yet commented on the block. Google Drive is a Google service that also integrates with other platforms – the loss of access may therefore have a knock-on impact on third-party products. Another site, the GitHub Open Source developer portal, relied on by many technology systems and startups, was blocked the following morning: Confirmed: Major Open Source infrastructure site @Github blocked in #Turkey 12:14PM to suppress #Redhack mail leakhttps://t.co/xObmf8D00j pic.twitter.com/geb5t0tH6X — Turkey Blocks (@TurkeyBlocks) October 9, 2016 The blocks are expected to heavily impact Google users and Dropbox Inc. customers who use the respective mobile applications, which runs on Android, iPhone as well as desktop computers, to archive their photos, share business documents and sign contracts.

Limited transparency Turkey had not issued a formal restriction order on the site as of evening Saturday 8 October 2016: While Dropbox is entirely blocked, Google Drive is still accessible to existing users – possibly because Google shares its business cloud hosting infrastructure and servers between Drive and it’s primary services including search. Official government blocking measure for Microsoft OneDrive TurkeyBlocks is working to collect forensic data captures of the incident. Most, but not all service providers were affected at the time of writing – the services appear to still accessible to a small number of users in the country not using the main providers. 5kSHARES ShareTweet Tweets by TurkeyBlocks Search for: Recent Posts Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp shutdown in Turkey New internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast: 8% of country now offline amidst Diyarbakir unrest Internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast following mayor’s detention Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive cloud services blocked in Turkey following leaks Internet shutdown in Turkey’s Southeast Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 Categories Incident Report Keep Updated Copyright © 2016 Turkey Blocks
Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Chrome 55 memory improvements By Martin Brinkmann on October 9, 2016 in Google Chrome - Last Update:October 9, 2016 13 The web browser Google Chrome 55 will use less memory thanks to improvements made to the browser's JavaScript engine. Memory use may be one of the deciding factors when it comes to selecting a browser. While it may not play a big role on systems with plenty of RAM, say 4 Gigabyte or more, it is still a hot topic on systems with less. Google Chrome is known for its memory hunger. If you open ten sites in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, you will likely notice that Chrome requires the most memory. You may check and control memory use in Chrome in various ways, for instance by installing extensions like Tab Limiter. Chrome 55 memory improvements Google announced recently that Chrome 55 will ship with memory improvements that reduce the browser's memory hunger. The first part of the announcement details how Google tracked and measured the improvements. While interesting from a technical point of view, the first couple of paragraphs offer little information on the improvements. The sites that Google benchmarked memory usage on includes several important properties including Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Imgur, Flipboard and the New York Times. Google highlights two main areas of improvement in the second half of the post: JavaScript Heap Size Reduction, and Zone Memory Reduction. The first improves memory usage on low-memory devices through the introduction of a memory reduction mode that fine-tunes garbage collection heuristics to lower memory usage of the JavaScript garbage collected heap. Google noticed an average heap size reduction of 50% when it ran benchmark tests on Chrome 53 and 55. The second memory related improvement that went into Chrome 55 benefits the browser on all devices. One of the main improvements in regards to Zone Memory comes "from reducing memory consumption during background parsing" according to Google. Background parsing allows the JavaScript engine of Chrome to parse JavaScript scripts while the page is loaded. Google noticed that the parser would keep zones alive longer than necessary. The company's engineers changed the duration which resulted in "reduced average and peak memory usage" in Chrome. Improvements are noticeable on all sites Google used to benchmark the improvements. Closing Words The reductions look impressive on first glance, but it remains to be seen if users will notice similar memory use improvements when their version of Chrome is updated to version 55. Users who don't want to wait can download the Dev or  Canary version of Chrome which are already at version 55 and 56 respectively to see if they notice improvements when using the browser. Google plans to release Chrome 55 to the release channel in December 2016.       Summary Article Name Chrome 55 memory improvements Description The web browser Google Chrome 55 will use less memory thanks to improvements made to the browser's JavaScript engine.

Opera introduced it on their Dev version, and it DOES NOT work, Opera Dev's memory footprint just keeps ballooning, reaching 2.5 - 3 Gb in 1 session !! In my view HSR is just marketing hype. Reply bwat47 October 10, 2016 at 5:15 pm # that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with heap size reduction, could just be a bug in the dev version or something Reply flyli5411 October 9, 2016 at 1:22 pm # Been using SlimJet browser now for few months ,Basically half memory compared to Firefox and Chrome ,Also just a really nice browser with lots of customizations etc. Reply Anonymous October 9, 2016 at 2:06 pm # Would be also nice to see memory consumption comparison between Chrome 55, Opera and Firefox 50 (when it's going to be released once in November). Reply Kubrick. October 9, 2016 at 2:08 pm # my experience with chrome on linux in terms of memory usage has always been encouraging.Naturally if more tabs are opened then memory usage will increase and this is by chrome design.For goodness sake if you have 4-8gb ram then why worry about memory usage,it is what memory is for, Reply Parker Lewis October 9, 2016 at 4:07 pm # I've heard this argument expressed so many times. Some people have little memory, some people have to run huge programs concurrently. If programmers were all as liberal with RAM as users who believe in this kind of arguments, it's not 8Gb that we would need to have a fast computer with apps that don't crash. (The consequence of a lack of RAM is not just an unusably slow computer, it's crashes too.) This can be (somewhat) illustrated by some low RAM Android phones. Android is pretty liberal with RAM because it "believes" in its ability to keep it fully in use and manage it without speed loss or app crashes. But if your phone has less than 1GB you will have to close apps manually if you want your phone to stay snappy. Apps will then be slower to start, but will work better and crash less. So yes, IMO an unnecessarily RAM hungry app is simply badly designed. Reply PBo October 9, 2016 at 11:12 pm # I agree. Switching between several projects and activities, I can easily have several dozens tabs and browser windows open simultaneously. I use different desktops to accomodate different activities. I often see 7 or 8 GB virtual memory used only by browsers and had to buy another 8GB of RAM just for that. This is eventually partially swapped. However, RAM is not the only issue. The permanent usage of 1 to 8% CPU by each browser can add up to more than 20% CPU being used for nothing by minimized windows for long as the computer is not asleep, so 12 hours a day. The global javascript switch doesn't prevent it any more in Firefox and firefox-based browsers after version 27 or 28. Why ? I have now been stuck for years at version 27. It's not extensions because it's the same all extensions disabled. In chrome and derived browsers, I have found no working global javascript switching extension. When will a browser integrate this option that scripts be stopped in background or minimized windows, please ???? I don't pay for electricity, CPUs and laptop batteries to have them spoilt this way. Rudolf Hunk October 9, 2016 at 10:56 pm # I upgraded to version 55 and my Chrome now uses more memory than ever? :P Reply Taomyn October 10, 2016 at 9:55 am # How about Google fixes their damned cached file system as well? I have some heavily used machines and their Windows profiles include Chrome folders nearly 10GB in size and nearly a million files. This is just crazy as the only way to clear it is to completely clear the file system and thus losing valuable site information. It also makes regular virus/malware scans ten times longer than they need to be. Reply Ben October 10, 2016 at 12:56 pm # They should allow the "one process" flag that is in chromium instead of disabling it. Reply Anonymous October 13, 2016 at 3:17 am # Do you have this info for Firefox as an comparison?

Google Posts Official Samples Taken with Pixel’s “Best Smartphone Camera Ever” GO The images were captured with the 12.3MP camera on Pixel Oct 9, 2016 09:41 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google recently announced two smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, manufactured together with HTC. While rear camera capacity on the two smartphones isn’t the highest on the market, Google promised that the devices come with the best smartphone camera on the market. To back up its claims, the company mentioned that Pixel cameras received the highest score ever from DxOMark, an industry standard for cameras and lens image quality measurements and ratings. Pixel cameras scored 89 points, slightly higher than Apple’s iPhone 7. To show off the camera’s capabilities, Google posted several images taken by Isaac Reynolds, Google’s camera product executive. The collection of images with the “#NoFilter needed” tagline are available for download on Google Photos. They show the Pixel camera’s capacity to perform under multiple lighting conditions. Pixel phones come with a 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture The images don’t seem to have been uploaded from a Pixel unit, as they lack EXIF data. Still, considering the clarity that each image offers, the pictures clearly don’t need any filters. The rear camera on the Pixel smartphones comes with a 12.3MP capacity, f/2.0 aperture, and the ability to record 4k videos at 30fps or 1080p videos at 120fps. The DxOMark study showed that the smartphone provides accurate exposure with good contrast and white balance. However, it may have some inconsistencies when it comes to repeated autofocus. Other cons to the rear camera concern video recording, which could result in motion blur on walking scenes in low-light conditions. As for the other features on the phones, Pixel comes with a 5.0-inch FHD AMOLED display and a 2,770mAh battery. It also has 4GB of RAM and runs a quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor. Front camera capacity reaches 8MP with f/2.4 aperture and fixed focus. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, is slightly larger, with a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display, and battery capacity is also higher at 3,450mAh. The smartphones will be officially released on October 20, but they’re already available for pre-order on Verizon, Google Store and Best Buy.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #Google#Pixel#Pixel XL#Camera samples#DxOMark subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Pixel camera samples (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Verizon to Handle System Updates on Pixel Phones, While Google Security Updates Google Pixel Battery Life Is 40% Higher than Nexus Smartphones Google Pixel Phones Come with Fewer Pre-Installed Verizon Apps Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Will Work on Republic Wireless Network Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 Could Use Powerful Exynos 9 Chipsets Inside iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels Leaked Video Reveals Microsoft’s Discontinued Apple Watch Killer Microsoft Reveals How It Made Windows 10 “the Most Secure Windows Ever” New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked AsusWrt-Merlin Provides New Firmware for ASUS Routers - Version 380.63.2 Ultra-Rugged Kyocera DuraForce Pro Goes Official at Sprint Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Coming Soon to T-Mobile 5 photos    Camera sample from Pixel phones New Android APKs Photo Grid APK: Updated November 12th, 11:44 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated November 12th, 11:42 GMT SHAREit APK: Updated November 12th, 11:40 GMT AZ Screen Recorder APK: Updated November 12th, 11:37 GMT Next Lock Screen APK: Updated November 12th, 11:34 GMT ZenUI Launcher APK: Updated November 12th, 11:26 GMT Evie Launcher APK: Updated November 12th, 10:56 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   HTC Bolt Goes Official at Sprint: 5.5-Inch QHD Display, 16MP Camera, Nougat more on: HTC Bolt i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The new Pixel phones are an evolution of Google’s previous Nexus line of Android phones with the company having more control over the manufacturing and branding of the device than in previous years, but they are still partnering with HTC behind the scenes. The Pixel phones are the first to come with Google’s new Assistant platform that it first unveiled earlier this year during its Google I/O event. The company also highlighted the fact that it built the phone to be ready for mobile virtual reality with its Daydream platform, and it’s offering users of the device unlimited full quality photo and video storage in the cloud. As for its claims of “the best smartphone camera”, Google pointed out a DXOMark rating of 89 for the Pixel’s 12.3 megapixel rear camera, which it says makes the Pixel’s camera the best ever in a smartphone. Google highlighted that claim while comparing it to the iPhone 7 (pictured below), but it didn’t include the iPhone 7 Plus…: That might be because DXOMark has only released results for the iPhone 7 so far. If Google’s claim of the best smartphone camera ever is only based on its DXOMark rating, it could soon have some competition from the iPhone 7 Plus’ rating.

October 4 AAPL: 113.00 0.48 Comment: Google just couldn’t leave Apple out of its iPhone competitor keynote Zac Hall - 1 month ago @apollozac iPhone Google View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Google’s keynote today was knocked by some observers for having a similar style to Apple keynotes: a funny video to start things off, an intro from the CEO to set the stage, and product leaders announcing new products that they work on. I don’t really buy into that as a critique. Apple usually does an impressive keynote; they use a format that other companies should copy. Something else that stood out is Google’s habit of using subtle references to Apple critiques to pitch its products. That’s just not very Apple. There was a reference to ‘bumping phones’ a few years ago when Apple introduced AirDrop, but Apple tastefully avoided any combustion jokes when it introduced the iPhone 7 last month. Google, on the other hand, just couldn’t leave Apple out of its keynote. Google’s Apple dings weren’t just limited to the easy headphone jack reference either. Three things I picked up at the start: Google said customers want “more than 1,000 songs in your pocket” now; that’s a reference to Steve Jobs’ iPod introduction Google said “our products just work” which sounds like a play on Jobs’ “it just works” line about Apple products Google described its Pixel smartphone as having “no unsightly camera bump” which iPhones do have (and a lot of Android phones too) The ‘1,000 songs in your pocket’ line seemed to be in the context of technology changing, but it didn’t come across as especially necessary considering the availability of streaming music services from a variety of companies not named Google. Describing products that “just work” is surely meant to be a slight against Apple services, and the camera bump line is odd considering how unattractive so many Android camera bumps are. Speaking of the camera, Google’s new Pixel phone touts a DxOMark score of 89, which it says is the highest ever for any smartphone. For context, the iPhone 7 recently scored an 86 and the rating for the dual-camera system on the iPhone 7 Plus is “coming soon.” Clearly Google and DxOMark coordinated the test and slide as it was included before the phone’s official announcement and included in the keynote, but it seems highly possible that the iPhone 7 Plus could also score an 89 if not higher. It’s unclear if DxOMark will wait for iOS 10.1 which includes the DSLR-like depth effect feature too. DxOMark seems to be ignoring the iPhone completely when describing the quality of the Pixel camera: “Overall, the Pixel did extremely well in capturing our natural test images, typically performing as well or better than other current flagship models. However, on our greenery test scene below, it didn’t perform as well as some of the other flagship phones, as it lost details in the shadows.” It used the HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 (both rated 88) for reference, but Pixel seems targeted in part at iPhone switchers with its premium price. Google even touts how easy it is to switch from iPhone. Then there’s the cheesy color names to discuss. We expected these but it’s even more cringeworthy to see on stage: Quite Black, Really Blue, and Very Silver. Contrast that with Apple’s iPhone 7 color lineup: Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. You can joke that Jet Black and Black is silly, but Quite, Really, and Very come across as self-parodying or self-deprecating, not serious. What’s wrong with black, silver, and blue? Speaking of not serious, I can’t help but think that Android phone makers are going to regret mocking the iPhone 7’s lack of a headphone jack in a few short years. For starters, iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone to drop the headphone jack, it was merely the first to popularize it on smartphones. Motorola beat Apple to the punch in 2016. It also seems plausible that most if not all smartphones could drop the headphone jack in a few years. USB-C audio is positioned to do what Lightning is doing on iOS, and wireless Bluetooth audio is cross-platform. But Google is using ‘3.5mm headphone jack’ as a feature on a spec sheet now. This wasn’t even worth a mention before the iPhone 7, right? Headphone jack is the new “runs Flash!” — Zac Hall (@apollozac) October 4, 2016 It reminds me of the situation with Adobe Flash several years ago. iOS never adopted Flash support due to performance, battery life, and security; Android touted Flash support (with the aforementioned issues) on mobile as a feature in ads and Flash still died. Listing the headphone jack on a spec sheet and advertising it as ‘surprisingly not new’ will look just as dated in a matter of years. (So will pitching your new phone as being so new it doesn’t have a version number. I’m waiting for the Pixel 2.) You could nitpick at the Pixel design too: it has the antenna lines that Apple just hid, the front has the chin of an iPhone 5 with the Touch ID-style fingerprint scanner moved to the back, and there’s no premium curved display like Samsung phones despite its premium price. It’s also not immediately evident that Google Assistant is superior to Siri. I use Siri a lot and noticed that most if not all of the demos for Google Assistant would work just as well using Siri since 2011. Sending a message, booking dinner with OpenTable, playing a song. Google’s contextual awareness of what’s on-screen is different but not new to Pixel. One thing Google does get right is unlimited photo and video storage in the cloud when you buy its Pixel phone. By comparison, iPhones come with 5GB of free iCloud storage with paid accounts for up to 2TB available. I really wonder what stops Apple from using unlimited photo and video storage as a reason for customers to buy its iPhones. Surely there’s not a significant amount of revenue from iCloud storage upgrades from photo sync alone. Google couldn’t pitch this feature either without reminding us of Apple. Google Photos ads are especially fond of the iOS ‘storage is full’ dialog box. It costs $2.99 a month to access my iCloud Photo Library on my 256GB iPhone 7 and I’m inching closer to needing the $9.99 a month 1TB tier. I’ll give Google that one.

By Dave Snelling / Published 10th October 2016 APPLE/GOOGLE RIVALS: Google has just announced its new Pixel smartphone Google is pretty confident that its new Pixel phone is going to be a big hit. With a AMOLED HD screen, decent camera, fast processor and premium design it's certainly got plenty going for it. Google is also including an easy way for iPhone owners to transfer their digital life from iOS to Android and is hoping Apple fans will jump ship. The Pixel is available for pre-order now with prices starting from a hefty £599 but before you make the switch here's seven things the Pixel can't do over its Apple rival. HERE'S 7 THINGS THE iPHONE CAN DO THAT THE PIXEL CAN'T Google major announcement in pictures - all the gadgets coming from Google Wednesday, 5th October 2016 GOOGLE has announced a host of new products including its new Pixel smartphone. 1 / 8 GOOGLE Google Pixel phone 1. TAKE IN THE BATH Google's Pixel can survive the odd splash of rain but dropping it down the loo could cause you a tech headache. Apple recently made their iPhone 7 and 7 Plus water resistant and it can now cope with a thorough soaking. In fact, Apple says users shouldn't have any issues with a 30-minute dip with their iPhone. .................................. 2. CAMERA ZOOM Google made a big song and dance about the Pixel's new camera including boasting that it's scored the highest marks ever from the famous DXO image tests. Daily Star Online hasn't tested this new camera yet but we do know one thing it doesn't have that the iPhone does. The new iPhone 7 Plus includes a dual lens which allows users to zoom when taking pictures. And we're not talking a pixel-busting digital zoom as the iPhone 7 Plus features a 2X optical zoom. This dual lens is also capable of taking pictures with depth of field making your smartphone snaps look like they've been taken on a pro camera. GOOGLE ON DISPLAY: Google's Pixel doesn't feature a Force Touch display DAILY STAR ONLINE Apple iPhone waterproof test 3. iOS 10 Android is getting much more user friendly and the Pixel features Google's very latest version of its Nougat software. However, Apple's iOS is still the easiest operating system to navigate and if you've got a Mac or an iPad you'll find it hard to switch to Android. Apps and games such as Nintendo's Super Mario Run often launch on iOS first, which is another reason to stick firmly with the iPhone. .................................. 4. FORCE TOUCH Apple introduced its Force Touch display last year and it's still one of the only smartphones on the market with this technology. Force Touch allows you to apply pressure to the screen to get quick access to features within apps and the iPhone's settings. Although the Pixel includes a super-sharp AMOLED display it doesn't feature any pressure sensitive tricks. APPLE GOOGLE/APPLE FEATURES: The iPhone will go head-to-head with Google's new Pixel 5. HUGE STORAGE Google is offering unlimited free cloud storage for anyone buying its Pixel but, unlike some of its Android rivals, it hasn't included expandable storage on the actual device. Although Apple doesn't have anyway of increasing memory, it has launched an iPhone with a whopping 256GB of storage which is double that of Google's biggest Pixel. .................................. 6. STEREO SPEAKERS It may not have a headphone port but the iPhone does has an incredible pair of stereo speakers. GETTY FANS: The iPhone brand is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal followers 7. iPHONE FACTOR Google has priced its Pixel in direct competition with Apple's iPhone and this could be its biggest hurdle. The iPhone is now nine years old and has a faithful army of loyal fans. With A-list celebs often caught using Apple's smartphone it's also still seen as the must-have device to own. Google is taking a big risk by pricing their Pixel so high and convincing fans to switch could be a tall order.

And, in a clear sign it wants to lure users, Google showed off a new feature to move content such as photos, contacts and settings from an iPhone.   They are even including a lead in the box to connect a Pixel to an iPhone.   Crucially, Google and EE, the network selling the devices, plan a multimillion-pound marketing campaign that will see the Pixel splashed across adverts on TV, in print and on billboards. An insider said: “By Christmas everyone will have heard of these phones.”   Not only do the Pixel phones look like the iPhone 7, they have similar features — detailed screens, top-of-the-range cameras and powerful processors.   They don’t, however, have the dual-lens camera of the bigger 7 Plus. Pixel handsets also feature Google Assistant, a new voice­activated virtual personal assistant that promises to answer questions and help organise users’ days for them.   Google reckons it is smarter than Apple’s similar Siri service.   When demonstrated on stage, the feature let Pixel offer details on a restaurant mentioned in a text message conversation — offering contact details, photos and directions.   Google drew laughs when it announced the Pixel devices have a headphone jack.   They also come with unlimited “cloud” storage, a service where you can back-up your photos, videos, contacts and emails on Google’s computers.   It is similar to Apple’s iCloud but that has a charge once you max out your free allowance. Many say they don’t swap phones because of the hassle of moving settings between rival devices, which is a key issue when switching between iPhones and devices running Android.   To help make that easier, Google has come up with the new software and thrown in a cable adapter.   The Pixel, with a 5in screen, and Pixel XL, which has a 5.5in one, are out on October 20 and can be pre-ordered from EE.   On two-year contracts, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month deal and the XL on £55.99. They come with unlimited minutes, texts and 10GB of data.   The phone can also be bought sim-free from £599 with 32GB of storage up to £819 with 128GB from Google or from Carphone Warehouse, which will also offer the phone on contracts with other networks.   Google has been involved in handsets before, under the Nexus name, but these are the first the company has fully designed.   And they are first to come under the “Phone by Google” branding.   The Nexus devices were produced with manufacturers including LG and Huawei and were not sold or marketed widely.

Companies like Samsung, LG, HTC and others didn't care - they were pushing their own proprietary features onto Android. And to be fair, Google adopted many of those innovations into the core OS. Still, the search giant wanted more control and it got it. The Pixel and Pixel XL bring the full Android experience. Google Allo and Duo handle messaging, Assistant helps with everyday tasks, Daydream gets into the emerging VR market, Google Photos stores your captures, Google Assistant collaborates with the Google Home hub to answer your questions and control your smart home. They have high-end hardware with sharp AMOLED screens, Snapdragon 821 chipsets, advanced 12MP cameras and HTC-built metal bodies. Clearly, Google positioned the Pixels as premium devices, as premium as Apple's iPhone. But can they actually compete? A OnePlus 3, ZTE Axon 7, Xiaomi Mi 5 and many others offer most of the same hardware at half the price. Android flagships add perks like wireless charging, OIS, water resistance and so on - not vital, but if you're going to pay $650+ you shouldn't accept compromises. Not to mention things like a microSD slot or a removable battery. So, which is it? Will the Pixels make Google more like Apple? Or will it go the way of Lumia?

   Main Contact us hitechchronicle.com Navigation Business Culture Technology Science Sport Worldwide Medicine National Technology Chromecast Ultra is still value for money despite the twofold price increase Oct 09 2016 After weeks of rumors and leaks about its specs and appearance, Google's new Chromecast Ultra has finally gotten its reveal, and right on the date suggested. Google Home is set to arrive in stores in November and is now up for pre-orders at $129 via the Google Store, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. At a press event today, Google introduced a higher-end Chromecast video streaming device, adding 4K and HDR support to the offering. A Wi-Fi router will pretty much do the job decently, but keep in mind that Chromecast Ultra boasts 4K video streaming, a much heavier stream than Full HD. The new Chromecast Ultra generation of devices will be able to stream 4k content - which is the latest available resolution on the market - from media services such as Netflix, Vudu, and Youtube. That makes it a really important device in the bigger picture of Google's aspirations. The new Chromecast is 1.8 times faster than the 1080P model, it includes better WiFi connectivity and there is an ethernet port in the power adapter if you need a wired connection to stream your 4K content. Interestingly, Google Chromecast Ultra is nearly twice as fast at streaming content compared to the company's first generation Chromecast. Unlike Google, however, the company's newest devices only support the HDR10 format, and the same goes for Nvidia's Shield TV, Microsoft new Xbox One S, Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 Pro and the recent PS4 firmware update. The leading name in this segment of 4K-capable products is Google's very own Chromecast. Google has announced that Google Play Movies will stream 4K content from November. Users can still mirror content to their TV from their Android smartphone or from their laptop's Chrome browser. This new device allows premium media streaming if you're willing to pay a little extra. Every since the Chromecast was released, it's been hailed as a good device because of its pricing and its features. Chance are that if you use a 4K tv, then your internet connection would also be top-speed. Instead of casting a Spotify playlist from the app on your iPhone (which drains your phone's battery) you can instead say "OK Google, play Beyoncé on my Chromecast", and let Google's Assistant do the rest.

How to join the network Recently, Google launched a video calling tool (yes, another one). Google Hangouts has been sidelined to Enterprise, and Google Duo is supposed to be the next big thing in video calling. So now we have Skype from Microsoft, Facetime from Apple, and Google with Duo. Each big company has its own equivalent service, each stuck in its own bubble. These services may be great, but they aren’t exactly what we imagined during the dream years when the internet was being built. The original purpose of the web and internet, if you recall, was to build a common neutral network which everyone can participate in equally for the betterment of humanity. Fortunately, there is an emerging movement to bring the web back to this vision and it even involves some of the key figures from the birth of the web. It’s called the Decentralised Web or Web 3.0, and it describes an emerging trend to build services on the internet which do not depend on any single “central” organisation to function. So what happened to the initial dream of the web? Much of the altruism faded during the first dot-com bubble, as people realised that an easy way to create value on top of this neutral fabric was to build centralised services which gather, trap and monetise information. Search Engines (e.g. Google), Social Networks (e.g. Facebook), Chat Apps (e.g. WhatsApp) have grown huge by providing centralised services on the internet. For example, Facebook’s future vision of the internet is to provide access only to the subset of centralised services it endorses (Internet.org and Free Basics). Meanwhile, it disables fundamental internet freedoms such as the ability to link to content via a URL (forcing you to share content only within Facebook) or the ability for search engines to index its contents (other than the Facebook search function). The Decentralised Web envisions a future world where services such as communication, currency, publishing, social networking, search, archiving etc are provided not by centralised services owned by single organisations, but by technologies which are powered by the people: their own community. Their users. The core idea of decentralisation is that the operation of a service is not blindly trusted to any single omnipotent company. Instead, responsibility for the service is shared: perhaps by running across multiple federated servers, or perhaps running across client side apps in an entirely “distributed” peer-to-peer model. Even though the community may be “byzantine” and not have any reason to trust or depend on each other, the rules that describe the decentralised service’s behaviour are designed to force participants to act fairly in order to participate at all, relying heavily on cryptographic techniques such as Merkle trees and digital signatures to allow participants to hold each other accountable. There are three fundamental areas that the Decentralised Web necessarily champions:privacy, data portability and security. Privacy: Decentralisation forces an increased focus on data privacy. Data is distributed across the network and end-to-end encryption technologies are critical for ensuring that only authorized users can read and write. Access to the data itself is entirely controlled algorithmically by the network as opposed to more centralized networks where typically the owner of that network has full access to data, facilitating  customer profiling and ad targeting. Data Portability: In a decentralized environment, users own their data and choose with whom they share this data. Moreover they retain control of it when they leave a given service provider (assuming the service even has the concept of service providers). This is important. If I want to move from General Motors to BMW today, why should I not be able to take my driving records with me? The same applies to chat platform history or health records. Security: Finally, we live in a world of increased security threats. In a centralized environment, the bigger the silo, the bigger the honeypot is to attract bad actors. Decentralized environments are safer by their general nature against being hacked, infiltrated, acquired, bankrupted or otherwise compromised as they have been built to exist under public scrutiny from the outset.   Just as the internet itself triggered a grand re-levelling, taking many disparate unconnected local area networks and providing a new neutral common ground that linked them all, now we see the same pattern happening again as technology emerges to provide a new neutral common ground for higher level services. And much like Web 2.0, the first wave of this Web 3.0 invasion has walked among us for several years already. Git is wildly successful as an entirely decentralised version control system – almost entirely replacing centralised systems such as Subversion. Bitcoin famously demonstrates how a currency can exist without any central authority, contrasting with a centralised incumbent such as Paypal. Diaspora aims to provide a decentralised alternative to Facebook. Freenet paved the way for decentralised websites, email and file sharing. Less famously, StatusNet (now called GNU Social) provides a decentralised alternative to Twitter. XMPP was built to provide a decentralised alternative to the messaging silos of AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, MSN, and others. Telephone switchboard operators circa 1914. Photo courtesy Flickr and reynermedia. However, these technologies have always sat on the fringe — favourites for the geeks who dreamt them up and are willing to forgive their mass market shortcomings, but frustratingly far from being mainstream. The tide is turning . The public zeitgeist is finally catching up with the realisation that being entirely dependent on massive siloed community platforms is not entirely in the users’ best interests. Critically, there is a new generation of Decentralised Startups that have got the attention of the mainstream industry, heralding in the new age for real. Blockstack and Ethereum show how Blockchain can be so much more than just a cryptocurrency, acting as a general purpose set of building blocks for building decentralised systems that need strong consensus. IPFS and the Dat Project provide entirely decentralised data fabrics, where ownership and responsibility for data is shared by all those accessing it rather than ever being hosted in a single location. The real step change in the current momentum came in June at the Decentralised Web Summit organised by the Internet Archive. The event brought together many of the original “fathers of the internet and World Wide Web” to discuss ways to “Lock the web open” and reinvent a web “that is more reliable, private, and fun.” Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, saw first hand the acceleration in decentralisation technologies whilst considering how to migrate the centralised Internet Archive to instead be decentralised: operated and hosted by the community who uses it rather being a fragile and vulnerable single service. Additionally, the enthusiastic presence of Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf, Brewster himself and many others of the old school of the internet at the summit showed that for the first time the shift to decentralisation had caught the attention and indeed endorsement of the establishment. Tim Berners-Lee said: The web was designed to be decentralised so that everybody could participate by having their own domain and having their own webserver and this hasn’t worked out. Instead, we’ve got the situation where individual personal data has been locked up in these silos. […] The proposal is, then, to bring back the idea of a decentralised web. To bring back power to people. We are thinking we are going to make a social revolution by just tweaking: we’re going to use web technology, but we’re going to use it in such a way that we separate the apps that you use from the data that you use. We now see the challenge is to mature these new technologies and bring them fully to the mass market. Commercially there is huge value to be had in decentralisation: whilst the current silos may be washed away, new ones will always appear on top of the new common ground, just as happened with the original Web. Github is the posterchild for this: a $2 billion company built entirely as a value-added service on top of the decentralised technology of Git — despite users being able to trivially take their data and leave at any point.  Similarly, we expect to see the new wave of companies providing decentralised infrastructure and commercially viable services on top, as new opportunities emerge in this brave new world. Ultimately, it’s hard to predict what final direction Web 3.0 will take us, and that’s precisely the point. By unlocking the web from the hands of a few players this will inevitably enable a surge in innovation and let services flourish which prioritise the user’s interests. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others have their own interests at heart (as they should), but that means that the user can often be viewed purely as a source of revenue, quite literally at the users’ expense. As the Decentralised Web attracts the interest and passion of the mainstream developer community, there is no telling what new economies will emerge and what kinds of new technologies and services they will invent. The one certainty is they will intrinsically support their communities and user bases just as much as the interests of their creators.

Public domain image. Not knowing the local language can be hell — but Google’s new translation software might prove to be the bilingual travel partner you’re always wanted. A recently released paper notes that Google’s Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to the familiar phrase-based approach. The framework is based on unsupervised deep learning technology. Deep learning simulates the way our brains form connections and process information inside a computer. Virtual neurons are mapped out by a program, and the connections between them receive a numerical value, a “weight”. The weight determines how each of these virtual neurons treats data imputed to it — low-weight neurons recognize the basic features of data, which they feed to the heavier neurons for further processing, and so on. The end goal is to create a software that can learn to recognize patterns in data and respond to each one accordingly. Programmers train these frameworks by feeding them data, such as digitized images or sound waves. They rely on big sets of training data and powerful computers to work effectively, which are becoming increasingly available. Deep learning has proven its worth in image and speech recognition in the past, and adapting it to translation seems like the logical next step. And it works like a charm Advertisement GNMT draws on 16 processors to transform words into a value called “vector.” This represents how closely it relates to other words in its training database — 2.5 billion sentence pairs for English and French, and 500 million for English and Chinese. “Leaf” is more related to “tree” than to “car”, for example, and the name “George Washington” is more related to “Roosevelt” than to “Himalaya”, for example. Using the vectors of the input words, the system chooses a list of possible translations, ranked based on their probability of occurrence. Cross-checking helps improve overall accuracy. The increased accuracy in translation happened because Google let their neural network do without much of the previous supervision from programmers. They fed the initial data, but let the computer take over from there, training itself. This approach is called unsupervised learning, and has proven to be more efficient than previous supervised learning techniques, where humans held a large measure of control on the learning process. In a series of tests pitting the system against human translators, it came close to matching their fluency for some languages. Bilingually fluent people rated the system between 64 and 87 percent better than the previous one. While some things still slip through GNMT’s fingers, such as slang or colloquialisms, those are some solid results. Google is already using the new system for Chinese to English translation, and plans to completely replace it’s current translation software with GNMT.   Like us on Facebook Independent science reporting, always spot on.

You may be about to find out. Two years ago, Amazon introduced the Amazon Echo, an unassuming, $180 cylinder that sits atop a kitchen counter or bookshelf, acting as a personal assistant that listens to you and does your bidding. Initially, the gadget’s main purpose was a little difficult to discern . But Echo and its Alexa voice recognition software have since become a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million gadgets sold as of April, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. MAKING THE HOME “SMART” Now the Echo is getting some company. On Tuesday, Google announced a similar smart speaker called Google Home, which will be available in November for $129. It will perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions plus controlling compatible lights and appliances. The Google Assistant that works with Home will also be able to access your calendar, Google Maps and other services if you allow. Apple has opened up its Siri personal assistant so that third-party developers can create new features for it, much the way Amazon has done with its Alexa software. Google Assistant is also opening up to outside apps in December. Sony is working on Xperia Agent , a digital assistant that connects to devices in the home. All these companies are chasing the smart-home market, which could grow to be a $71 billion global industry by 2018, up from $33 billion in 2013 and $25 billion in 2012, according to Juniper Research. That’s growing fast, although it’s still much smaller than the smartphone market, which the research firm IDC valued at about $412 billion in 2015. But while the Echo carved out an early success, it remains to be seen whether voice-recognition smart speakers will truly break into the mainstream. “They’re early, (but) the market is early, and we have a long way to go,” said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner. LEARNING NEW SKILLS One key to the Echo’s success was Amazon’s willingness to work with third-party developers, allowing it to add new functions each week, making it easy for owners of the speaker to discover new ways to use it. (It launched with a few dozen so-called `skills’ and now has thousands). “Initially we got it for music,” said Brian Bishop, a business analyst in Tomball, Texas, whose family uses two Echos. “Later, when it controlled the lights and fans and outlets, that just made it even better.” Interest in smart homes appears to be rising as more people become enamored with their smartphones. A recent online survey of more than 4,600 adults in the U.S. by Forrester Research’s Technographics found 57 percent of them either had used or were interested in using a smart home device such as lights or thermostats designed for remote control. The Echo’s hands-free operation filled an undiscovered niche in the smart-home universe. Users can just say the wake word “Alexa” and direct it to do a task like turn on lights or set a timer. Since you don’t need to use a smartphone or tablet, that sets it apart from other smart home systems like those offered by Samsung or Apple. SPEAK TO ME People seem to have an easier time talking to a speaker that has no other interface than they do talking to a smartphone. “I’ve never used Cortana. I don’t use Google and my wife doesn’t use Siri, but everybody talks to Alexa,” Bishop from Texas said. “I couldn’t really tell you why. That was the only way to communicate, so we all got in the habit.” Buck Wise, an advertising executive in Portland, Oregon, tried several variants of smart home systems, but said the Echo worked best for him because of the hands-free speaker. He has lights, blinds, and his garage door synced with the Echo. “Alexa truly is the brain of our home and it would feel like 100 steps backwards to get through a day without her,” Wise said. What won him over? Commanding the device just by speaking – and without having to fire up an app – basically did the trick, he said. BIG AMBITIONS Google has a lot of catching up to do. Amazon first hinted at its Echo ambitions in a Super Bowl ad featuring Alec Baldwin and seen by more than 100 million people. Beginning in April the Echo went on sale at retail outlets including Best Buy, Home Depot electronic stores such as RadioShack and others. The same month, Amazon opened up its smart home capabilities to let all developers of smart home functions integrate with Alexa. It’s also launched two other Echo-like devices, the smaller $50 Dot – which it now sells in six-packs so people can have one in every room – and the portable $100 Tap, to give Alexa even broader reach. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, says the goal is for Alexa to keep getting smarter as it continues to build new “skills” over the coming years. “The hope is you can ask Alexa anything and it will be able to respond correctly, quickly and be able to be there,” he said.

Companies such as Google are now enlisting residents to chart the narrow streets A young resident walks in the mostly demolished Vila Autódromo favela community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Despite winning a drawn-out legal battle to save a tiny slice of their community from the bulldozers clearing a path for Olympic and Paralympic Games infrastructure, residents of Vila Autódromo were furious to discover that they had been wiped off the map anyway. The community’s Facebook group last month posted a photo of the official city guide’s omission of the favela in favour of a solid chunk of beige representing Olympic Park. “Vila Autódromo is here, yes! Counting us out of the maps produced by the City Council is divisive and antisocial,” the post read. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vila Autódromo Facebook post. Photograph: Facebook While city authorities might be ignoring poorer parts of the city, private companies such as Google are stepping in to map previously excluded parts of Rio de Janeiro. Urban planner Raquel Rolnik, former UN special rapporteur on adequate housing, says exclusions from maps have long proved a key element for Rio in securing moral and legal authority for evicting favela residents, with tens of thousands losing their homes in the lead-up to the Olympic Games alone. She says favelas have been fighting for decades just to make it on to the planning maps that serve as the basis for determining provision of city services and on where to stage construction projects. “This Vila Autódromo situation reminds me of a [Brazilian Petroleum giant] Petrobras advertisement that showed the city from above, and if you see the picture it has the landscape of Rio without any favelas in the hills, which are completely green,” Rolnik says. “That’s a powerful mechanism of denial of existence.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Petrobras advert wiping out Rio de Janeiro’s favelas. Photograph: Viomundo The Rio De Janeiro city council produced the guide through its tourism arm RioTur, which in turn commissioned Mirian Isabel Say of Temática Cartografia to create the map. “There was no discrimination, prejudice or deliberate exclusion,” Say explains. She argues it is not technically feasible to include all details of a city in a tourist map, and that if residents were unhappy they could provide feedback for consideration in the next update. Say’s efforts with RioTur certainly went further than previous editions of the agency’s city guides, which like the Petrobras advertisement and the work of many private mapmaking companies render even high-profile favelas like Vidigal, one of the city’s top tourist attractions, and Rocinha, featuring a population of more than 70,000, as uninhabited jungle backdrops for the wealthy urban enclaves of São Conrado and Leblon. Online map providers once excluded favelas as well, but the digital topography is changing rapidly. Microsoft and Google have both ramped up coverage of Rio’s informal urban areas, however, the inclusion of certain favelas with a high crime rate proved controversial last year when 70-year-old Regina Murmura was murdered after the Google-owned Waze app directed her to a dangerous area featuring a street with the same name as her intended destination. In response Waze introduced an automatic warning system for Rio users when they choose a route through high-crime areas. Google Maps meanwhile has abandoned its previous approach of showing these communities as blank spaces, taking the opportunity to expand into the city’s untapped market of roughly 1.4 million favela residents. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rocinha is the largest favela in Brazil. Photograph: Max Opray Unmapped, these residents “have no addresses to list on job applications or bank accounts, and aren’t able to access many economic opportunities, essential services, even basic rights as citizens,” wrote Google director of global product partnerships Alessandro Germano in a post on the company’s blog in July. The company enlisted, via local NGO AfroReggae, waves of residents equipped with backpack-mounted cameras for coverage of streets too narrow and steep for the company’s Street View cars. Google says it has now mapped 26 favelas. It also launched an online video tour of Rio’s favelas as part of a bid to humanise the residents of areas many foreign tourists and even Brazilians are too fearful to visit. Rocinha resident Carlos Pragradar says it is frustrating his favela has been overlooked for so long, but appreciates the inclusion on Google Maps and has made sure the music classes he teaches are marked online. “The music school is for children but I also do our carnival street band, which could be something for tourists, so hopefully being on the map can help us grow,” he says. “Rocinha has capoeira, it has lots of things – this gives us visibility.” Google’s most powerful contribution might not even be deliberate. As the photos are only updated periodically, going for a virtual stroll in Street View doesn’t just show the current state of neighbourhoods, but how they once were. That includes Vila Autódromo before and during the evictions that saw most of the former fishing community wiped out. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vila Autódromo before the demolition. Photograph: Google Street Map Where today sprawls the asphalt of an Olympic Park bus interchange, on Street View some of the now-demolished dusty streets of the favela hauntingly linger on, residents frozen in time as they go about their day. From denying the existence of favelas to providing evidence of what is lost when such communities are destroyed, mapmaking organisations appear to have travelled in a full circle.

The US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany and India are all ahead of us in the queue. Google says it plans to sell the phones in more countries, but offers no further details. There’s also no news about when the creepy Google Home speaker will come here. The marketing says the phones are made by Google. That’s not true. HTC makes them. The company struggles to sell phones under its own name, so the contract will be a relief. Priced like an Apple Google is betting its brand carries as much weight with customers as Apple or Samsung. It asks Apple and Samsung-like prices. In the US, the cheapest Pixel costs US$650. That’s the same as the cheapest Apple iPhone 7. Samsung prices are similar. Google propaganda says it “obsessed over every detail, from the industry design to the user experience” of the Pixels. The words sound like something Steve Jobs might have said. Guru The phones include a 12.3 mega-pixel camera. Google says its “photography gurus” spent a year optimising the camera. There’s also a quick-charge battery that can deliver 7 hours of use on a charge of 15 minutes. That’s useful if you forget to charge overnight and need to get to work in a hurry. Google’s latest foray into branded hardware follows earlier failures. Google Glass was a flop. The brief dalliance with Motorola was unhappy. Google bought Nest but failed to capitalise on it. On the other hand, the earlier Google-branded Nexus phones are among the best Androids. Not really about hardware Most of the attention on the Pixel phone announcement centres on yet another Google move into hardware. The company sees integrating phone hardware and software, in the way Apple does with the iPhone, gives it an edge over other phone makers. This integration is an idea Google had been quick to dismiss in the past. It may not have escaped your attention that those other phone makers are supposed to be Google’s partners. They are the companies who make Android phones. Tension in the Android camp To suggest this could be a source of tension between Google and the companies making Android phones is putting it mildly. Relationships between Google and phone makers, especially Samsung, have never been entirely cordial. But this is a stab in the back. When Microsoft first moved into hardware with the Surface Pro tablets it went to great lengths not to tread on its partner’s toes. It made soothing noises about its strategy. Officially the Surface was only there to show them the way. Even today Microsoft chooses not to compete head-on with the big PC maker’s main product lines. How to win friends and influence them In contrast Google seems content to trample on partners. One fear is that it wants to displace its Android partners in their relationships with mobile carriers. In Australia Google formed an exclusive relationship with Telstra - that’s moving right in on Samsung’s turf. At the same time it seems to be undermining the Android value chain. As you’d expect from Google, the Pixel phones are more about software than hardware. Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence-based digital assistant, is preloaded on Pixel phones. Siri competition On one level Google Assistant is a direct competitor with Apple’s Siri. The phone software is, in effect, a client to back-end services provided by Google. It is a way of tieing the hardware more closely to the search giant. Google Assistant also cuts rival phone makers out of an important part of the value chain. It links straight back to Google’s data centres. It leaves little room for other Android phone makers to enter the services market. If phone makers lie awake at night worrying about Pixel, privacy advocates and, perhaps the rest of us, will lose sleep over Google’s surveillance. Data mining The new Pixel phones are one part of a strategy to help Google collect more data and more intimate data than ever before. At the same announcement the company took the wraps off Google Home. It is a home speaker with a built-in microphone. Home includes a voice-activated version of Google Assistant and can link to internet-of-things devices in your home. Google Home is always listening. It is the ultimate surveillance devices prettied up as a domestic appliance. It would require a near impossible feat of willpower not to feed it with a constant steam of the most personal and intimate data. When George Orwell wrote 1984 he never dreamed that Big Brother could get citizens to buy the listening devices spying on them. The idea of then earning billions by using it to learn their preferences and selling them more things was beyond belief. The clever-sounding artificial intelligence Google talks of isn’t there to help you. It’s not to make life better, to ease your burdens. It exists to mine your most intimate data then sell it to retailers who can turn it into gold. If that doesn’t worry you, nothing will.

He’s determined to make it stop.

McAdams May 16, 2016 ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner Nov 11, 2016 Bianca Bosker November 2016 Issue Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size On a recent evening in San Francisco, Tristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, took a name tag from a man in pajamas called “Honey Bear” and wrote down his pseudonym for the night: “Presence.” Harris had just arrived at Unplug SF, a “digital detox experiment” held in honor of the National Day of Unplugging, and the organizers had banned real names. Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. I followed him into a spacious venue packed with nearly 400 people painting faces, filling in coloring books, and wrapping yarn around chopsticks. Despite the cheerful summer-camp atmosphere, the event was a reminder of the binary choice facing smartphone owners, who, according to one study, consult their device 150 times a day: Leave the WMD on and deal with relentless prompts compelling them to check its screen, or else completely disconnect. “It doesn’t have to be the all-or-nothing choice,” Harris told me after taking in the arts-and-crafts scene. “That’s a design failure.” Harris is the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience. As the co‑founder of Time Well Spent, an advocacy group, he is trying to bring moral integrity to software design: essentially, to persuade the tech world to help us disengage more easily from its devices. While some blame our collective tech addiction on personal failings, like weak willpower, Harris points a finger at the software itself. That itch to glance at our phone is a natural reaction to apps and websites engineered to get us scrolling as frequently as possible. The attention economy, which showers profits on companies that seize our focus, has kicked off what Harris calls a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” “You could say that it’s my responsibility” to exert self-control when it comes to digital usage, he explains, “but that’s not acknowledging that there’s a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job is to break down whatever responsibility I can maintain.” In short, we’ve lost control of our relationship with technology because technology has become better at controlling us. A “Hippocratic oath” for software designers would stop the exploitation of people’s psychological vulnerabilities. Under the auspices of Time Well Spent, Harris is leading a movement to change the fundamentals of software design. He is rallying product designers to adopt a “Hippocratic oath” for software that, he explains, would check the practice of “exposing people’s psychological vulnerabilities” and restore “agency” to users. “There needs to be new ratings, new criteria, new design standards, new certification standards,” he says. “There is a way to design based not on addiction.” Joe Edelman—who did much of the research informing Time Well Spent’s vision and is the co-director of a think tank advocating for more-respectful software design—likens Harris to a tech-focused Ralph Nader. Other people, including Adam Alter, a marketing professor at NYU, have championed theses similar to Harris’s; but according to Josh Elman, a Silicon Valley veteran with the venture-capital firm Greylock Partners, Harris is “the first putting it together in this way”—articulating the problem, its societal cost, and ideas for tackling it. Elman compares the tech industry to Big Tobacco before the link between cigarettes and cancer was established: keen to give customers more of what they want, yet simultaneously inflicting collateral damage on their lives. Harris, Elman says, is offering Silicon Valley a chance to reevaluate before more-immersive technology, like virtual reality, pushes us beyond a point of no return. All this talk of hacking human psychology could sound paranoid, if Harris had not witnessed the manipulation firsthand. Raised in the Bay Area by a single mother employed as an advocate for injured workers, Harris spent his childhood creating simple software for Macintosh computers and writing fan mail to Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple. He studied computer science at Stanford while interning at Apple, then embarked on a master’s degree at Stanford, where he joined the Persuasive Technology Lab. Run by the experimental psychologist B. J. Fogg, the lab has earned a cultlike following among entrepreneurs hoping to master Fogg’s principles of “behavior design”—a euphemism for what sometimes amounts to building software that nudges us toward the habits a company seeks to instill. (One of Instagram’s co-founders is an alumnus.) In Fogg’s course, Harris studied the psychology of behavior change, such as how clicker training for dogs, among other methods of conditioning, can inspire products for people. For example, rewarding someone with an instantaneous “like” after they post a photo can reinforce the action, and potentially shift it from an occasional to a daily activity. Harris learned that the most-successful sites and apps hook us by tapping into deep-seated human needs. When LinkedIn launched, for instance, it created a hub-and-spoke icon to visually represent the size of each user’s network. That triggered people’s innate craving for social approval and, in turn, got them scrambling to connect. “Even though at the time there was nothing useful you could do with LinkedIn, that simple icon had a powerful effect in tapping into people’s desire not to look like losers,” Fogg told me. Harris began to see that technology is not, as so many engineers claim, a neutral tool; rather, it’s capable of coaxing us to act in certain ways. And he was troubled that out of 10 sessions in Fogg’s course, only one addressed the ethics of these persuasive tactics. (Fogg says that topic is “woven throughout” the curriculum.) From Our November 2016 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe Harris dropped out of the master’s program to launch a start-up that installed explanatory pop-ups across thousands of sites, including The New York Times’. It was his first direct exposure to the war being waged for our time, and Harris felt torn between his company’s social mission, which was to spark curiosity by making facts easily accessible, and pressure from publishers to corral users into spending more and more minutes on their sites. Though Harris insists he steered clear of persuasive tactics, he grew more familiar with how they were applied. He came to conceive of them as “hijacking techniques”—the digital version of pumping sugar, salt, and fat into junk food in order to induce bingeing. McDonald’s hooks us by appealing to our bodies’ craving for certain flavors; Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter hook us by delivering what psychologists call “variable rewards.” Messages, photos, and “likes” appear on no set schedule, so we check for them compulsively, never sure when we’ll receive that dopamine-activating prize. (Delivering rewards at random has been proved to quickly and strongly reinforce behavior.) Checking that Facebook friend request will take only a few seconds, we reason, though research shows that when interrupted, people take an average of 25 minutes to return to their original task. Sites foster a sort of distracted lingering partly by lumping multiple services together. To answer the friend request, we’ll pass by the News Feed, where pictures and auto-play videos seduce us into scrolling through an infinite stream of posts—what Harris calls a “bottomless bowl,” referring to a study that found people eat 73 percent more soup out of self-refilling bowls than out of regular ones, without realizing they’ve consumed extra. The “friend request” tab will nudge us to add even more contacts by suggesting “people you may know,” and in a split second, our unconscious impulses cause the cycle to continue: Once we send the friend request, an alert appears on the recipient’s phone in bright red—a “trigger” color, Harris says, more likely than some other hues to make people click—and because seeing our name taps into a hardwired sense of social obligation, she will drop everything to answer. In the end, he says, companies “stand back watching as a billion people run around like chickens with their heads cut off, responding to each other and feeling indebted to each other.” A Facebook spokesperson told me the social network focuses on maximizing the quality of the experience—not the time its users spend on the site—and surveys its users daily to gauge success. In response to this feedback, Facebook recently tweaked its News Feed algorithm to punish clickbait—stories with sensationalist headlines designed to attract readers. (LinkedIn and Instagram declined requests for comment. Twitter did not reply to multiple queries.) Even so, a niche group of consultants has emerged to teach companies how to make their services irresistible. One such guru is Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, who has lectured or consulted for firms such as LinkedIn and Instagram. A blog post he wrote touting the value of variable rewards is titled “Want to Hook Your Users? Drive Them Crazy.” While asserting that companies are morally obligated to help those genuinely addicted to their services, Eyal contends that social media merely satisfies our appetite for entertainment in the same way TV or novels do, and that the latest technology tends to get vilified simply because it’s new, but eventually people find balance. “Saying ‘Don’t use these techniques’ is essentially saying ‘Don’t make your products fun to use.’ That’s silly,” Eyal told me. “With every new technology, the older generation says ‘Kids these days are using too much of this and too much of that and it’s melting their brains.’ And it turns out that what we’ve always done is to adapt.” Google acquired Harris’s company in 2011, and he ended up working on Gmail’s Inbox app. (He’s quick to note that while he was there, it was never an explicit goal to increase time spent on Gmail.) A year into his tenure, Harris grew concerned about the failure to consider how seemingly minor design choices, such as having phones buzz with each new email, would cascade into billions of interruptions. His team dedicated months to fine-tuning the aesthetics of the Gmail app with the aim of building a more “delightful” email experience. But to him that missed the bigger picture: Instead of trying to improve email, why not ask how email could improve our lives—or, for that matter, whether each design decision was making our lives worse? Harris gives off a preppy-hippie vibe that allows him to move comfortably between Palo Alto boardrooms and device-free retreats. (Olaf Blecker) Six months after attending Burning Man in the Nevada desert, a trip Harris says helped him with “waking up and questioning my own beliefs,” he quietly released “A Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users’ Attention,” a 144-page Google Slides presentation. In it, he declared, “Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25–35) working at 3 companies”—Google, Apple, and Facebook—“had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention … We should feel an enormous responsibility to get this right.” Although Harris sent the presentation to just 10 of his closest colleagues, it quickly spread to more than 5,000 Google employees, including then-CEO Larry Page, who discussed it with Harris in a meeting a year later. “It sparked something,” recalls Mamie Rheingold, a former Google staffer who organized an internal Q&A session with Harris at the company’s headquarters. “He did successfully create a dialogue and open conversation about this in the company.” Harris parlayed his presentation into a position as product philosopher, which involved researching ways Google could adopt ethical design. But he says he came up against “inertia.” Product road maps had to be followed, and fixing tools that were obviously broken took precedence over systematically rethinking services. Chris Messina, then a designer at Google, says little changed following the release of Harris’s slides: “It was one of those things where there’s a lot of head nods, and then people go back to work.” Harris told me some colleagues misinterpreted his message, thinking that he was proposing banning people from social media, or that the solution was simply sending fewer notifications. (Google declined to comment.) Harris left the company last December to push for change more widely, buoyed by a growing network of supporters that includes the MIT professor Sherry Turkle; Meetup’s CEO, Scott Heiferman; and Justin Rosenstein, a co-inventor of the “like” button; along with fed-up users and concerned employees across the industry. “Pretty much every big company that’s manipulating users has been very interested in our work,” says Joe Edelman, who has spent the past five years trading ideas and leading workshops with Harris. Through Time Well Spent, his advocacy group, Harris hopes to mobilize support for what he likens to an organic-food movement, but for software: an alternative built around core values, chief of which is helping us spend our time well, instead of demanding more of it. Thus far, Time Well Spent is more a label for his crusade—and a vision he hopes others will embrace—than a full-blown organization. (Harris, its sole employee, self-funds it.) Yet he’s amassed a network of volunteers keen to get involved, thanks in part to his frequent cameos on the thought-leader speaker circuit, including talks at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society; the O’Reilly Design Conference; an internal meeting of Facebook designers; and a TEDx event, whose video has been viewed more than 1 million times online. Tim O’Reilly, the founder of O’Reilly Media and an early web pioneer, told me Harris’s ideas are “definitely something that people who are influential are listening to and thinking about.” Even Fogg, who stopped wearing his Apple Watch because its incessant notifications annoyed him, is a fan of Harris’s work: “It’s a brave thing to do and a hard thing to do.” At Unplug SF, a burly man calling himself “Haus” enveloped Harris in a bear hug. “This is the antidote!,” Haus cheered. “This is the antivenom!” All evening, I watched people pull Harris aside to say hello, or ask to schedule a meeting. Someone cornered Harris to tell him about his internet “sabbatical,” but Harris cut him off. “For me this is w‑talk,” he protested. Harris admits that researching the ways our time gets hijacked has made him slightly obsessive about evaluating what counts as “time well spent” in his own life. The hypnosis class Harris went to before meeting me—because he suspects the passive state we enter while scrolling through feeds is similar to being hypnotized—was not time well spent. The slow-moving course, he told me, was “low bit rate”—a technical term for data-transfer speeds. Attending the digital detox? Time very well spent. He was delighted to get swept up in a mass game of rock-paper-scissors, where a series of one-on-one elimination contests culminated in an onstage showdown between “Joe” and “Moonlight.” Harris has a tendency to immerse himself in a single activity at a time. In conversation, he rarely breaks eye contact and will occasionally rest a hand on his interlocutor’s arm, as if to keep both parties present in the moment. He got so wrapped up in our chat one afternoon that he attempted to get into an idling Uber that was not an Uber at all, but a car that had paused at a stop sign. An accordion player and tango dancer in his spare time who pairs plaid shirts with a bracelet that has presence stamped into a silver charm, Harris gives off a preppy-hippie vibe that allows him to move comfortably between Palo Alto boardrooms and device-free retreats. In that sense, he had a great deal in common with the other Unplug SF attendees, many of whom belong to a new class of tech elites “waking up” to their industry’s unwelcome side effects. For many entrepreneurs, this epiphany has come with age, children, and the peace of mind of having several million in the bank, says Soren Gordhamer, the creator of Wisdom 2.0, a conference series about maintaining “presence and purpose” in the digital age. “They feel guilty,” Gordhamer says. “They are realizing they built this thing that’s so addictive.” I asked Harris whether he felt guilty about having joined Google, which has inserted its technology into our pockets, glasses, watches, and cars. He didn’t. He acknowledged that some divisions, such as YouTube, benefit from coaxing us to stare at our screens. But he justified his decision to work there with the logic that since Google controls three interfaces through which millions engage with technology—Gmail, Android, and Chrome—the company was the “first line of defense.” Getting Google to rethink those products, as he’d attempted to do, had the potential to transform our online experience. Snapchat’s tactics for hooking users may make Facebook’s look quaint. At a restaurant around the corner from Unplug SF, Harris demonstrated an alternative way of interacting with WMDs, based on his own self-defense tactics. Certain tips were intuitive: He’s “almost militaristic about turning off notifications” on his iPhone, and he set a custom vibration pattern for text messages, so he can feel the difference between an automated alert and a human’s words. Other tips drew on Harris’s study of psychology. Since merely glimpsing an app’s icon will “trigger this whole set of sensations and thoughts,” he pruned the first screen of his phone to include only apps, such as Uber and Google Maps, that perform a single function and thus run a low risk of “bottomless bowl–ing.” He tried to make his phone look minimalist: Taking a cue from a Google experiment that cut employees’ M&M snacking by moving the candy from clear to opaque containers, he buried colorful icons—along with time-sucking apps like Gmail and WhatsApp—inside folders on the second page of his iPhone. As a result, that screen was practically grayscale. Harris launches apps by using what he calls the phone’s “consciousness filter”—typing Instagram, say, into its search bar—which reduces impulsive tapping. For similar reasons, Harris keeps a Post-it on his laptop with this instruction: “Do not open without intention.” His approach seems to have worked. I’m usually quick to be annoyed by friends reaching for their phones, but next to Harris, I felt like an addict. Wary of being judged, I made a point not to check my iPhone unless he checked his first, but he went so long without peeking that I started getting antsy. Harris assured me that I was far from an exception. “Our generation relies on our phones for our moment-to-moment choices about who we’re hanging out with, what we should be thinking about, who we owe a response to, and what’s important in our lives,” he said. “And if that’s the thing that you’ll outsource your thoughts to, forget the brain implant. That is the brain implant. You refer to it all the time.” Curious to hear more about Harris’s plan for tackling manipulative software, I tagged along one morning to his meeting with two entrepreneurs eager to incorporate Time Well Spent values into their start-up. Harris, flushed from a yoga class, met me at a bakery not far from the “intentional community house” where he lives with a dozen or so housemates. We were joined by Micha Mikailian and Johnny Chan, the co-founders of an ad blocker, Intently, that replaces advertising with “intentions” reminding people to “Follow Your Bliss” or “Be Present.” Previously, they’d run a marketing and advertising agency. “One day I was in a meditation practice. I just got the vision for Intently,” said Mikailian, who sported a chunky turquoise bracelet and a man bun. “It fully aligned with my purpose,” said Chan. They were interested in learning what it would take to integrate ethical design. Coordinating loosely with Joe Edelman, Harris is developing a code of conduct—the Hippocratic oath for software designers—and a playbook of best practices that can guide start-ups and corporations toward products that “treat people with respect.” Having companies rethink the metrics by which they measure success would be a start. “You have to imagine: What are the concrete benefits landed in space and in time in a person’s life?,” Harris said, coaching Mikailian and Chan. Harris hopes that companies will offer a healthier alternative to the current diet of tech junk food—perhaps at a premium price. At his speaking engagements, Harris has presented prototype products that embody other principles of ethical design. He argues that technology should help us set boundaries. This could be achieved by, for example, an inbox that asks how much time we want to dedicate to email, then gently reminds us when we’ve exceeded our quota. Technology should give us the ability to see where our time goes, so we can make informed decisions—imagine your phone alerting you when you’ve unlocked it for the 14th time in an hour. And technology should help us meet our goals, give us control over our relationships, and enable us to disengage without anxiety. Harris has demoed a hypothetical “focus mode” for Gmail that would pause incoming messages until someone has finished concentrating on a task, while allowing interruptions in case of an emergency. (Slack has implemented a similar feature.) Harris hopes to create a Time Well Spent certification—akin to the leed seal or an organic label—that would designate software made with those values in mind. He already has a shortlist of apps that he endorses as early exemplars of the ethos, such as Pocket, Calendly, and f.lux, which, respectively, saves articles for future reading, lets people book empty slots on an individual’s calendar to streamline the process of scheduling meetings, and aims to improve sleep quality by adding a pinkish cast to the circadian-rhythm-disrupting blue light of screens. Intently could potentially join this coalition, he volunteered. As a first step toward identifying other services that could qualify, Harris has experimented with creating software that would capture how many hours someone devotes weekly to each app on her phone, then ask her which ones were worthwhile. The data could be compiled to create a leaderboard that shames apps that addict but fail to satisfy. Edelman has released a related tool for websites, called Hindsight. “We have to change what it means to win,” Harris says. The biggest obstacle to incorporating ethical design and “agency” is not technical complexity. According to Harris, it’s a “will thing.” And on that front, even his supporters worry that the culture of Silicon Valley may be inherently at odds with anything that undermines engagement or growth. “This is not the place where people tend to want to slow down and be deliberate about their actions and how their actions impact others,” says Jason Fried, who has spent the past 12 years running Basecamp, a project-management tool. “They want to make things more sugary and more tasty, and pull you in, and justify billions of dollars of valuation and hundreds of millions of dollars [in] VC funds.” Rather than dismantling the entire attention economy, Harris hopes that companies will, at the very least, create a healthier alternative to the current diet of tech junk food. He recognizes that this shift would require reevaluating entrenched business models so success no longer hinges on claiming attention and time. As with organic vegetables, it’s possible that the first generation of Time Well Spent software might be available at a premium price, to make up for lost advertising dollars. “Would you pay $7 a month for a version of Facebook that was built entirely to empower you to live your life?,” Harris says. “I think a lot of people would pay for that.” Like splurging on grass-fed beef, paying for services that are available for free and disconnecting for days (even hours) at a time are luxuries that few but the reasonably well-off can afford. I asked Harris whether this risked stratifying tech consumption, such that the privileged escape the mental hijacking and everyone else remains subjected to it. “It creates a new inequality. It does,” Harris admitted. But he countered that if his movement gains steam, broader change could occur, much in the way Walmart now stocks organic produce. Currently, though, the trend is toward deeper manipulation in ever more sophisticated forms. Harris fears that Snapchat’s tactics for hooking users make Facebook’s look quaint. Facebook automatically tells a message’s sender when the recipient reads the note—a design choice that, per Fogg’s logic, activates our hardwired sense of social reciprocity and encourages the recipient to respond. Snapchat ups the ante: Unless the default settings are changed, users are informed the instant a friend begins typing a message to them—which effectively makes it a faux pas not to finish a message you start. Harris worries that the app’s Snapstreak feature, which displays how many days in a row two friends have snapped each other and rewards their loyalty with an emoji, seems to have been pulled straight from Fogg’s inventory of persuasive tactics. Research shared with Harris by Emily Weinstein, a Harvard doctoral candidate, shows that Snapstreak is driving some teenagers nuts—to the point that before going on vacation, they give friends their log-in information and beg them to snap in their stead. “To be honest, it made me sick to my stomach to hear these anecdotes,” Harris told me. Harris thinks his best shot at improving the status quo is to get users riled up about the ways they’re being manipulated, then create a groundswell of support for technology that respects people’s agency—something akin to the privacy outcry that prodded companies to roll out personal-information protections. While Harris’s experience at Google convinced him that users must demand change for it to happen, Edelman suggests that the incentive to adapt can originate within the industry, as engineers become reluctant to build products they view as unethical and companies face a brain drain. The more people recognize the repercussions of tech firms’ persuasive tactics, the more working there “becomes uncool,” he says, a view I heard echoed by others in his field. “You can really burn through engineers hard.” There is arguably an element of hypocrisy to the enlightened image that Silicon Valley projects, especially with its recent embrace of “mindfulness.” Companies like Google and Facebook, which have offered mindfulness training and meditation spaces for their employees, position themselves as corporate leaders in this movement. Yet this emphasis on mindfulness and consciousness, which has extended far beyond the tech world, puts the burden on users to train their focus, without acknowledging that the devices in their hands are engineered to chip away at their concentration. It’s like telling people to get healthy by exercising more, then offering the choice between a Big Mac and a Quarter Pounder when they sit down for a meal. And being aware of software’s seductive power does not mean being immune to its influence. One evening, just as we were about to part ways for the night, Harris stood talking by his car when his phone flashed with a new text message. He glanced down at the screen and interrupted himself mid-sentence. “Oh!” he announced, more to his phone than to me, and mumbled something about what a coincidence it was that the person texting him knew his friend. He looked back up sheepishly. “That’s a great example,” he said, waving his phone. “I had no control over the process.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Art of Interviewing Henry Kissinger Jeffrey Goldberg on his conversations with the controversial American statesman Leah Varjacques Nov 11, 2016 About the Author Bianca Bosker is the author of Original Copies and the forthcoming Cork Dork.

On Wednesday, the day the country, and the world, were just beginning to absorb the shock of Donald Trump’s victory, I spoke with Kissinger by telephone to get his postelection thoughts. He told me that he was expecting other nations, particularly the great powers, to enter a period of intense study, in order to understand how they should respond to a Trump presidency. He also said he expected the Islamic State, or other similarly minded jihadist organizations, to test Trump early by launching attacks, in order to provoke a reaction (or, he suggested, an overreaction).

In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Kena Betancur / AFP / Getty ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner None A Trump voter describes his worldview in great detail, and despite his blunt quote above, his note is more nuanced and perhaps more relatable than you think: I am Southern. I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U.S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families, mixed-race families, minorities, and same-sex couples. Our sports teams are multi-cultural, diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success—however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t—many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out—and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news.” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary; I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have—and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams. I voted for the wrecking ball—and I feel better about it now than I did in the booth.   Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight, or sleep Last month, my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests—the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it, there was a lull and, feeling exhausted all of a sudden, I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom, I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadn’t meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasn’t new for me. A few weeks earlier, I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office, and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep, the same tiredness that came on when, as a child, I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But he had a clue it might. Four years ago, Arnade traded in a Wall Street job for a life of semi-transience, photographing addiction and poverty in the South Bronx. After a few years, he decided to take his project national. “I wanted to see if what I saw there was true across the rest of America,” he told me on the phone this week. Over the past two years, Arnade put over 100,000 miles on his car traveling through “overlooked” American towns with names that sound nearly fictional: Kingsport, Tennessee; Natchitoches, Louisiana; Mingo, West Virginia. He photographs and tweets about the people he meets, begetting a mosaic of a divided and frustrated country during the rise of Trump. “It was almost accidental that I got into the Donald Trump thing,” he says with a laugh.

The Watergate Babies—as the recently elected Democratic congressmen were known—were young, idealistic liberals who had been swept into office on a promise to clean up government, end the war in Vietnam, and rid the nation’s capital of the kind of corruption and dirty politics the Nixon White House had wrought. Richard Nixon himself had resigned just a few months earlier in August. But the Watergate Babies didn’t just campaign against Nixon; they took on the Democratic establishment, too.

McAdams May 16, 2016 ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner Nov 11, 2016 Priscilla Alvarez Oct 8, 2016 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The Latino population in the United States reached nearly 57 million in 2015 and according to U.S. Census Bureau projections, it’s expected to increase to 119 million by 2060. But just how much influence Latino voters will bring to bear on future elections is hard to assess. Latinos have historically been the least likely group of voters in the country to cast a ballot, but this year’s contentious election might serve as a turning point in their turnout. A number of organizations are hoping to capitalize on increased interest in the election by launching initiatives specifically designed to help Latinos register to vote.   In 2012, 48 percent of eligible Latino voters cast a ballot, compared with roughly 66 percent of black voters and 64 percent of white voters. But their voting habits may be changing: Latino voter registration is reportedly climbing in Colorado, Florida, and Nevada, three important swing states. And on the night of the first presidential debate in September, the search term “registrarse para votar”—translated to “register to vote” in English—spiked on Google, reaching the highest level ever seen in the United States. Areas with a high concentration of Latinos—like California, Texas, and Florida—saw the biggest jump in searches for “registrarse para votar.” Latest from Politics The Tech White Power Used to Go Viral Ahead of next month’s election, voter organizations are promoting registration in ways that are catered to the Latino electorate and their proclivities. One such group is Phone2Action, a civic engagement platform that launched an app on Voter Registration Day, September 27, that capitalizes on Latinos’ dependency on mobile devices. A Pew Research Center survey released in July found that 94 percent of Latinos said they access the Internet through a mobile device—a higher percentage than among white users—and a 2015 Nielsen report found that Latinos use “more mobile minutes than average device users.” The Phone2Action tool, also available on desktop, allows users to check their registration, find information about early voting and polling locations, and learn more about presidential and down-ballot candidates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Consumer Technology Association, and National Association of Manufacturers are among those who have partnered with Phone2Action to offer the app on their websites. Recent data seems to affirm Phone2Action’s strategy: Since National Voter Registration Day—which was heavily promoted on Google, Facebook, and the nation’s largest Spanish-language network, Univision—searches for “registrarse para votar” have been largely conducted on mobile. According to Google trends data, 87 percent of searches were on a mobile device, compared with 13 percent of searches on a desktop computer. Meanwhile, search interest for “register to vote” stood at 76 percent on mobile and 24 percent on desktop. Other voter organizations are also working to mobilize Latinos. Voto Latino, a nonpartisan group that focuses on engaging young Latinos, announced this month that its outreach efforts have so far resulted in 101,720 voter registrations. President and CEO Maria Teresa Kumar said in a statement that the group’s “digital-first strategy of engaging young Latinos has led to more than 5,000 voter registrations per day in the last weeks.” National Council of La Raza and Mi Familia Vota, two organizations that focus on Latino voter participation, are also deploying efforts to increase turnout. Latino outreach efforts could have a lopsided benefit for Hillary Clinton, whose opponent has used inflammatory language about Latinos and proposed policies that would directly impact the immigrant community. Donald Trump launched his campaign calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. More than a year later, after the first debate, he doubled-down on his past criticisms of Venezuelan-born Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe. Trump’s campaign has ostensibly tried to land Latino voters through his National Hispanic Advisory Council, but even that effort has come with its hiccups. Following his recent speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona—where he demonstrated a continuing hardline stance on deportations and border security—some members decided to leave the group. Clinton’s Latino outreach has also fallen short, though, when compared with President Obama’s strategy in 2012—and these initiatives could help compensate for any deficiencies. The Clinton camp has been criticized, for example, for the rollout of its Latino targeting efforts; staffers waited until only recently to release ads directed toward Spanish speakers in some states. Still, as BuzzFeed reports, Obama may have spent more than Clinton on paid Spanish-language media, but he wasn’t facing Trump—a man whose rhetoric on the trail alone has alienated Latinos. Generally speaking, Democrats stand to gain more from increased Latino voter registration. According to a Pew survey from 2014, “half of Latino registered voters say the Democratic Party has more concern for Latinos than the Republican Party.” In 2012, Barack Obama received overwhelming support from Latino voters: Seventy-one percent of Latino voters cast a ballot for Obama compared with 27 percent for Mitt Romney. The dismal showing for the then-Republican nominee alarmed the GOP. After the election, the party released its so-called autopsy report, which called for a greater emphasis on minority outreach. Years later, Trump’s candidacy appears to have hindered those efforts, as he trails behind Clinton among Latino voters. In a Univision poll released last month, the Democratic nominee held a commanding lead among Latino voters in battleground states. A Fox News Latino poll showed Clinton 46 points ahead of Trump among Latinos nationwide. Across the board, private, seemingly apolitical companies are assisting in voter registration this year. Facebook, for example, launched its first voter registration drive in September. Uber, in partnership with Google, has pushed out registration information via email and social-media campaigns. “This is a historic election and we plan to spend the weeks leading up to Election Day making sure every eligible Uber rider and driver has the opportunity to get involved,” the company said in a statement. Despite low Latino voter turnout in the past, the NALEO Educational Fund projects the number of Latinos expected to go to the polls in November to increase by 17 percent, up from 8.7 percent in 2012. Google-search spikes and an uptick in some states’ voter registration could be early hints at increased interest among Latinos. But whether those searches and visits will translate to votes on Election Day is a whole different story.

He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Kena Betancur / AFP / Getty ‘I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball’ Chris Bodenner None A Trump voter describes his worldview in great detail, and despite his blunt quote above, his note is more nuanced and perhaps more relatable than you think: I am Southern. I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U.S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families, mixed-race families, minorities, and same-sex couples. Our sports teams are multi-cultural, diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success—however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t—many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out—and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news.” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary; I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have—and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams. I voted for the wrecking ball—and I feel better about it now than I did in the booth.   Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight, or sleep Last month, my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests—the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it, there was a lull and, feeling exhausted all of a sudden, I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom, I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadn’t meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasn’t new for me. A few weeks earlier, I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office, and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep, the same tiredness that came on when, as a child, I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But he had a clue it might. Four years ago, Arnade traded in a Wall Street job for a life of semi-transience, photographing addiction and poverty in the South Bronx. After a few years, he decided to take his project national. “I wanted to see if what I saw there was true across the rest of America,” he told me on the phone this week. Over the past two years, Arnade put over 100,000 miles on his car traveling through “overlooked” American towns with names that sound nearly fictional: Kingsport, Tennessee; Natchitoches, Louisiana; Mingo, West Virginia. He photographs and tweets about the people he meets, begetting a mosaic of a divided and frustrated country during the rise of Trump. “It was almost accidental that I got into the Donald Trump thing,” he says with a laugh.

Sitting on the neon-lit stage, Dave McClure couldn’t contain himself. The 500 Startups founder and investor used his appearance at the Web Summit conference on Wednesday to loudly criticize his own industry for President-elect Donald Trump’s victory: Technology has a role in that we provide communication platforms for the rest of the fucking country. It’s a propaganda medium and if people aren’t aware of the shit they’re being told; if they’re being told a story of fear; if they’re being told a story of other; if they’re not understanding that people are trying to use them to get to fucking office then, yes, assholes like Trump are going to take office and it’s our duty and our responsibility as entrepreneurs, as citizens of the fucking world, to make sure that shit does not happen.

The result is an increasingly dangerous political system. It was January 1975, and the Watergate Babies had arrived in Washington looking for blood. The Watergate Babies—as the recently elected Democratic congressmen were known—were young, idealistic liberals who had been swept into office on a promise to clean up government, end the war in Vietnam, and rid the nation’s capital of the kind of corruption and dirty politics the Nixon White House had wrought. Richard Nixon himself had resigned just a few months earlier in August. But the Watergate Babies didn’t just campaign against Nixon; they took on the Democratic establishment, too.

A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. One of the limitations of information on the Web is that it is organized differently at each site on the Web. As a newly granted Google patent notes, there is no official catalog of information available on the internet, and each site has its own organizational system. Search engines exist to index information, but they have issues, as described in this new patent that make finding information challenging. Limitations on Conventional Keyword-Based Search Engines The patent granted to Google, in September of 2016, discusses a way to organize information on the Web in a manner which can help to better organize and index that information, using context vectors to better understand how words are being used. The patent describes limitations of search engines that are based upon indexing content using keywords, such as: A search engine working with Conventional keyword searching will return all instances of the keyword being searched for, regardless of how that word is used on a site. This can be a lot of results Conventional search engines may only return only the home page of a site that contains the keyword. Finding where the keyword is used on the site could be difficult Often a conventional search engine will return a list of URLs in response to a keyword search that may be difficult to modify or search further in a meaningful manner. Information obtained through a search can become dated quickly. Such information may need to be checked up upon The patent tells us about those limitations and also points out some of the limitations of directories that could also be used to help find information. It then goes on to provide a possible solution to this problem, with a “data extraction tool” capable of providing many of the benefits of both search engines and directories, without the drawbacks that this patent points out. Is this The Google Search Engine with RankBrain Inside? A search engine based on a data extraction tool like the one described in the patent would be an improvement over most search engines. Is this Google’s search engine with RankBrain applied to it? It’s possible that it is, though it doesn’t use the word RankBrain The Bloomberg introduction to RankBrain, Google Turning Its Lucrative Web Search Over to AI Machines provides information about the algorithm used in RankBrain, and it tells us: RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities — called vectors — that the computer can understand. This new patent refers to what it calls Context Vectors to index content about words found on the Web. To put it clearly, the patent tells us: In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When a search submits a query to a search engine, we are told that the search engine may try to give it contexts based upon “other queries from the same user, the query associated with other information or query results from the same use, or other inputs related to that user to give it more context. The patent is: User-context-based search engine Inventors: David C. Taylor Application Date: 09/04/2012 Grant Number: 09449105 Grant Date: 09/20/2016 Abstract: A method and apparatus for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When RankBrain was first announced, I found a patent that was co-invented by one of the members of the team that was working on it, that described how Google might provide substitutions for some query terms, based upon an understanding of the context of those terms and the other words used in a query. I wrote about that patent in the post, Investigating Google RankBrain and Query Term Substitutions. I think reading the patent that post is about, and the one that this post is about can be helpful in understanding some of the ideas behind a process such as RankBrain. This patent does provide a lot of insights in explaining the importance of context and how helpful that can be to a system that may be attempting to extract data from a source and index that data in a way which makes it easier to locate. I liked this passage in particular: Interestingly, some words in the English language, and other languages pertain to many different areas of subject matter. Thus, one may think of the universe of communication as containing numerous domains of subject matter. For example, the various domains in FIG. 2 refer to centers of meaning or subject matter areas. These domains are represented as somewhat indistinct clouds, in that they may accumulate a vocabulary of communication elements about them that pertain to them or that relate to them. Nevertheless, some of those same communication elements may also have application elsewhere. For example, a horse to a rancher is an animal. A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. Thus, the communication element that we call “horse” belongs to, or pertains to, multiple domains. A search engine that can identify the domains or contexts that a word might fit within may be able to better index such words; as described in this patent: In an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, a search engine process is developed that provides a deterministic method for establishing context for the communication elements submitted in a query. Thus, it is possible for a search engine now to determine to which domain or domains a communication element is “attracted.” Since few things are absolute, domains may actually overlap or be very close such that they man share certain communication elements. That is, communication elements do not “belong” to any domain, they are attracted to or have an affinity for various domains, and may have differing degrees of affinity for differing domains. One may think of this affinity as perhaps a goodness of fit or a best alignment or quality alignment with the subject matter of a particular domain. Contextually Rewarding Search Results The patent tells us that a search engine that works well is one that provides a searcher with information in response to a query that is “comparatively close related”. Information that is exactly what has been sought. Then information that is close to what has been sought and is still useful. Then it tells us that what would be “contextually unrewarding” would be information that shares the word in a completely different and useless context related to the query Words might be related to a wide range of particular fields or subject matter domains. The patent describes how these might be used: Typically, a domain list of about 40 to 50 terms have been found to be effective. Some domain lists have been operated successfully in an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention with as few as 10 terms. Some domain lists may contain a few hundreds of individual terms. For example, some domains may justify about 300 terms. Although the method is deterministic, rather than statistical, it is helpful to have about 40 to 50 terms in the domain list in order to improve the efficiency of the calculations and determinations of the method. The domain lists have utility in quickly identifying the particular domain to which their members pertain. This results from the lack of commonality of the terms and the lack of ambiguity as to domains to which they may have utility. By the same token, a list as small as the domain lists are necessarily limited when considering the overall vocabulary of communication elements available in any language. Thus, the terms in domain lists do not necessarily arise with the frequency that is most useful for rapid searching. That is, a word that is unique to a particular subject matter domain, but infrequently used, may not arise in very many queries submitted to a search engine. A process for creating a vocabulary list of a substantial universe or a substantial portion of a universe of communication elements may be performed by identifying a body or corpus of information organized by topical entries. Thereafter, the text of each of those entries identified may be subjected to a counting process in which occurrences of terms from the domain list occur within each of the topical entries. Ultimately, a calculation of a macro context may be made for each of the topical entries. This calculation is based on the domain lists, and the domains represented thereby. This is where this patent enters into the world of the Semantic Web. The places where different subject matter domains may be identified for different words could be in knowledge bases or online encyclopedias. Such collections of what is referred to as public knowledge might be called a “corpus”. This kind of corpus of information could be used to create a context vector used to index different meanings of words. When a different meaning is found, it might then be counted from that information corpus The patent tells us that terms found in such a place could be “individual words, terms, expressions, phrases, and so forth.” The patent attempts to put this into context for us with this statement: One may think of a topical entry as a vocabulary term. That is, every topical entry is a vocabulary word, expression, place, person, etc. that will be added to the overall vocabulary. That is, for example, the universe may be divided into about 100 to 120 domains for convenient navigation. Likewise, the domain lists may themselves contain from about 10 to about 300 select terms each. By contrast, the topical entries that may be included in the build of a vocabulary list may include the number of terms one would find in a dictionary such as 300 to 800,000. Less may be used, and conceivably more. Nevertheless, unabridged dictionaries and encyclopedias typically have on this order of numbers of entries. Contexts as Vectors When RankBrain first came out, there was a post published that looked at some information that might make it a little more understandable; it included some information about Geoffrey Hinton’s Thought Vectors, and there’s more about those in this post from Jennifer Slegg: RankBrain: Everything We Know About Google’s AI Algorithm. There is a Google Open Source Blog post on Word Vectors which is closely related, titled Learning the meaning behind words, written by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, and Quoc Le. Ilya Sutskever was a student of Geoffry Hinton. Tomas Mikolov worked on a number of papers about word vectors while with the Google Brain team, including Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space. The patent spends a fair amount of time describing what it considers context vectors to be; the different domains which a word might fall into, and number of occurrences or weights for those words within those domains. It’s worth drilling down into the patent and reading about how terms can be considered context vectors that a search engine might label them as. When a searcher enters a query into a search engine to be searched, the query may be classified within contexts, to help in selecting information in response to that query. Using a Browser Helper Object The patent describes how it might identify different domains that might be associated with specific terms. It tells us that this might be done: By compiling a list of domain-specific questions, it is possible to (1) specify differences between very similar domains with great precision, and (2) create a rapid way to prototype a domain that does not require many hours of an expert’s time, and can be expanded by relatively inexperienced people. The patent also describes the use of a BHO (Browser Helper Object) in this manner: Another slightly more complex implementation is something like a Browser Helper Object (BHO) that runs on the user’s machine and watches/categorizes all surfing activity. With this system, even non-participating sites can contribute to the picture of the user, and any clicking the user does to ad sites served by certified clicks will pick up a much more comprehensive picture. The patent provides more details on how this contextual vector based system might work, and how data might be extracted from web pages. It is highly recommended reading if you want to get a better sense of how a context-based system might be used to index the web and to make specific information on the Web easier to improve upon most conventional keyword-based search engines.

Butler says: 10/05/2016 at 3:35 am The article is very interesting. They are starting to think more effectively about the process of understanding. Note; however, that they do not (and cannot) define context precisely. I am able to do this. It will be in my next post on Constants, Variances, and Identities. Note also how Google is also trying to set the precedent for patenting knowledge. This route will lead further to its own demise. This is wrong ethically, morally, and legally as well.﻿ Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 7:44 am Hi Carey, Thank you. It’s interesting seeing what Google is trying to do with the processes they’ve come up with to drive search. Trying to account for contexts seems to make sense. We’ll see where Google tries to take this next. Adam says: 10/05/2016 at 8:57 am Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! I am not sure which one I prefer? 😉 Derek says: 10/05/2016 at 10:20 am Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. I thought the BHO component and its role in disambiguation was one of the most interesting parts of the patent. It reflects how critical browser and email market share are to Google’s core search business, especially since that user data is proprietary and unavailable to competing search engines. It also justifies Google’s continued investment in other freeware like Sheets and Docs—anything that yields a logged-in user improves Google’s chances of returning a better result than Bing or DuckDuckGo. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:18 am Hi Adam, If you write about a topic, and provide enough facts and details so that a search engine can get a good sense of what your page is about (because it understands the context of your page) , I think that is an improvement over keyword stuffing or string matching of query terms with document terms. It’s good seeing Google making these kind of steps. Also good seeing that they are learning context from places such as knowledgebases, which makes indexing the web more about knowledge graphs. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:23 am Hi Derek, Thank you! The Browser Helper Object was interesting and definitely tied into presenting this approach as a data extraction tool approach. Learning from the context of a searcher’s query may be improved by understanding the search history, prior searches, and web page visits of searchers. A searcher’s use of things like Google+ can also provide helpful information about searchers to put the context of a search into better perspective as well. Robert says: 10/05/2016 at 11:51 pm The Browser Helper Object seems to be the logical continuation from using other factors such as search history or even click through rates. This would seem to be a kind of reverse engineering where Google would be able to now get a better idea of what you’re not doing? As in elements that aren’t drawing your interaction and as such determine that they aren’t a good match. An example of: sometimes knowing what doesn’t work is in itself knowledge of something. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 8:39 am Hi Robert, I think the BHO described in the patent would give Google a better idea of what you are doing, rather than what you aren’t doing. Riya Sharma says: 10/26/2016 at 11:25 pm Interesting…. Good to know that Google is not just keep sitting at its legacy Thanks for sharing such a informative article…. fernanda says: 11/02/2016 at 11:51 am It´s Nice. Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:31 am Thanks, Fernanda. It does make searches smarter by better understanding the meanings of words based upon their context. Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:33 am Thank you Riya, I was happy when I found this patent and read through it, because it does describe an interesting approach from Google.

This can produce more interesting lessons than even digging into things like patents and whitepapers. For instance, I published a post last night, October 4th, 2016, on Context Vectors. On Twitter this morning, Dan Shure had a question about the snippet for my post, wondering why the snippet date was April 10, 2016. I knew the answer immediately. Dan’s Questioning Tweet: When I researched the post, and found the patent I wanted to write about, I used the WIPO Patentscope website to find the patent. I copied information from the WIPO pages, including the formatting of the Dates the patent was published and granted: I copied those dates into my post in exactly the same formatting found on the WIPO site DD/MM/YY instead of the way dates are formatted in the US MM/DD/YY: It appears that Google decided that it should take a lesson from the context of my blog post, and read the date of my post using DD/MM/YY instead of MM/DD/YY: Which answers the question that Dan asked about why Google decided that the date in the snippet should be April 10, 2016 instead of the date that it was actually published October 4, 2016. Google may have paid more attention to the context of date formatting than it possibly should have in that post. It does show that Google is paying attention to context, though. There were some others involved in a discussion of this anomaly this morning, and I wanted to give a shout-out to them for getting involved (thanks!): Aymen Loukil Steven Weldler Tylor Hermanson I’m not sure if it will help much, but I have changed the Formatting of the patent dates in the post about context vectors to the Americanized format of MM/DD/YY. Google is still showing a snippet date of April 10, 2016. Aymen Loukil suggested I try using DateTime Schema. It looks like that is aimed at providing information regarding sites that provide schedules, and Schema.org tells us that it is used on “Between 10 and 100 domains”. Nothing on that page seemed to explain how to explain the formatting used by Dates. Funny to learn about how Google might use context to format a snippet date based upon how the post the snippet is about may format dates within it. I decided to write about Dan’s question and its answer to keep it in mind and learn from it (I suspect we won’t see a patent just about how Google decides upon how to format dates in snippets. I’ve written some other posts about patents from the WIPO pages, and used the European formatting of dates from those. I should go back and look at the snippet dates Google may have given those… Facebook51 Twitter152 Google+15 LinkedIn105 Pinterest2 325shares Related Post navigation Previous PostGoogle Patents Context Vectors to Improve SearchNext PostKnowledge Panels in Site Audits 32 thoughts on “Learning SEO by Looking at Anomalies” Aaron Bradley says: 10/05/2016 at 11:39 am Hey Bill, FWIW I declare my blog posts to be of type schema.org/Article and then provide datePublished and dateModified in ISO 8601 date format (as per schema.org/Date). Google’s seems to understand this pretty well (though I’m not sure if it favors this structured data over in-post dates). Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:06 pm Hi Aaron, Thanks. I’m not sure I even thought about whether or not the formatting of the dates I included in my post from yesterday would influence the formatting of the snippet date that Google showed for my blog post. I have now learned that Google does pay attention to information like that, which is why I am sharing the information. We can see that Google may pay attention to the dates that are shown on a post, but might ignore the country of origin of the post when deciding upon the date format to use to interpret when those in-post dates actually refer to, if the post refers to dates that are formatted differently. I probably need to find other posts I’ve written that have included WIPO patent information, and see if the snippet dates showing for those also uses european formatting in snippets for those posts. If I had a site that published schedules for transit, I would probably want to find a way to format dates so that I was certain that Google understood the formatting I was using. Snippet dates, though? I wrote and published the post yesterday, which wasn’t April 10, 2016; I didn’t expect Google to change the date format that it had been using for most other posts on my site because I didn’t change the formatting of the dates I received from WIPO. Now I understand the risk of not doing so. 🙁 Maybe including the Structured Data information in addition to the in-post dates may be a good idea. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:39 pm Hi Aaron, Thinking about this again, I wonder if I had the right structured data, and included European formatted dates from WIPO in my post if Google would choose the formatting it sees in the post over the information it sees in structured data. I don’t know which it would choose. California is a long way from Europe, so I don’t know why they decided to use european formatting. Cliff Sarcona says: 10/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Question: What exactly does this say about Google’s ability to track content within context? Would you say it proves that contextual backlinks are given more weight then say a random link posted without any content, or a link thrown in a side bar? Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 4:06 pm Hi Cliff, Thank you for sharing your questions. This patent describes a process by which a search engine can better index content found on the Web and assign contextual meanings to terms or phrases or words based upon finding those in a knowledge base such as an online encyclopedia, and assign a weight to the term(s) based upon how often it shows up in such sources. The combination of the contextual meanings (from different subject matter domains) and weights applied to those meanings is referred to as a “Context Vector.” The patent isn’t about links or backlinks, and doesn’t refer to contextual backlinks at all, so comparing it to a random link or a link in a sidebar isn’t a consideration here at all. The idea behind this patent is to better index content found on the web, and to apply contexts to queries when searches are performed to make it more likely that a searcher finds what they are looking for. Viva Traffic says: 10/05/2016 at 4:55 pm Out of curiosity, does a post with earlier dates typically rank higher? For example, 2012 vs a 2016 post, will the 2016 post rank higher being that its newer information, or is that not factored in with seo? Rasmita Sahoo says: 10/06/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help a lot of beginners like me. Thanks Again. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 4:13 pm Hi Rasmita, You’re welcome. If you do see something odd in Google’s search results. and you can capture a screen shot of it, do so. And then ask about it, in places like Twitter. It is a good way to learn. Sometimes you can catch Google experimenting on something, and it’s good to see that happening, too. Andrew says: 10/08/2016 at 11:27 am Interesting to see how Google really drills down to content/context and not just url/title/description/H1. Really need to be on your toes while writing anything these days! Bill Slawski says: 10/08/2016 at 6:07 pm Hi Andrew, It is interesting seeing how Google can get a sense of the meanings of words on pages, and the context of those words. If what you write is about something, in a particular context, it should be easier for Google to find it. I’m liking the idea of context vectors.

Alnoor Verjee says: 10/24/2016 at 3:51 pm Hi Bill, quick question – do you think implementing a date time schema would help in ranking newer content in any way or is it just for context purposes? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:42 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think that a date/time schema would solve the problem I have with the format of the date the post was published being read wrong by Google. It probably doesn’t have any impact on the rankings of that page either. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:42 pm Hello Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help me a lot. Thanks you.

Flypa says: 11/10/2016 at 2:00 am Does that mean if I publish a post in 2013 and update it in 2016, will that post show up higher in search results? Great post once again. Thanks Bill Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:00 am Hi Flypa, No, changing the dates on post that you made shouldn’t have any effect on the rankings of those posts. However, if Google notices that a post you wrote in the past starts getting a lot of new links pointed to it, it might take those new links as a sign that people are interested in the content of your post, and might consider it timely or evergreen. Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:02 am Hi Cristina, Thank you for your kind words – Good hearing that people are getting value from my posts.

With the launch of the two devices, Google has given a break to its ‘Nexus’ lineup and has streamlined the naming scheme for all the devices. Although made by HTC, these smartphone are also the first ones to come without any OEM branding. Both feature aluminium and glass frames and come in Black, Silver and Blue (limited the US) colour variants. The Google Pixel starts at $649 for 32GB in-built storage, the Pixel XL costs $769 for 32GB and $869 for 128GB version. Also, both run Android 7.1 Nougat OS out of the box. Both smartphones will sport the company’s own ‘Google Assistant’ which is already present in the Allo messaging app. Users can touch and hold the home button to activate the Google Assistant. The duo also features the new Pixel launcher. Both will also include Google Duo video messaging app. The company says that the Pixel and the Pixel XL will also have their own set of Live Cases. The Pixel smartphones can be pre-ordered via Google’s website and will hit the shelves starting October 20 as per the company. The devices will be available in US, UK, Australia, Canada and Germany this month and will arrive in India in October 13. The more powerful of the two, Google Pixel XL, features a 5.5-inch QHD (1440×2560 pixels) resolution Amoled display with Gorilla Glass 4 and comes with the integrated Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor on the back. The smartphone is powered by the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 with 4GB RAM and comes in three storage variants: 32GB and 128GB; external storage support option is also there.

MARKETING 5 Foolproof Ways to Improve Your SEO Driving traffic to your website is not as complicated as you think - but you need to have a strategy. By Molly Reynolds Molly Reynolds has a strong passion for helping creative innovators fine-tune their skills for selling their product and themselves. For more of her work, please visit The Unicorn in the Room. @Molly_Reynolds1 The Unicorn in the Room@Molly_Reynolds1 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Fifteen years ago, most small business owners would never attempt an SEO strategy by themselves. It all seemed so complicated - plus there wasn't as much great information out there and not as many tools that helped the new guys improve their ranking. In fact, if you'll recall, these were the days before Adwords was invented and you'd have Google reps visiting your office asking you which keywords you needed to buy. You couldn't access your analytics in real time - you'd have to wait a month until the reps came back and told you how you did! Times have changed (thankfully) and entrepreneurs can take SEO matters into their own hands just by keeping up to date on algorithm changes, using the right tools, and being diligent. It's a common misconception that all you have to do to improve your SEO is post a lot of content and your traffic will increase. Not true, unfortunately. Remember, there is so much content on the internet and not all of it is created equal. If you're a do-it-yourself-SEOer, make sure you're doing these five things: 1. Get your site indexed It's quite possible that you're not ranking because your site has not been indexed with Google - so the bots don't even know your site exists! I learned this lesson the hard way when I was first starting out. If you don't know how to index your site, you can either go to Google's help page and follow the steps or go to a site like Upwork and pay a freelancer $25 to do it for you. 2. Take advantage of SEO plugins There are a lot of free or cheap resources available to help small businesses succeed in their online marketing and SEO is no exception. According to Tommy McDonald of SerpLogic, Wordpress is the best free do-it-yourself platform for building an SEO-friendly website. And if you find SEO plugins (such as Yoast SEO), they will help you stay on top of your site optimization. Platforms like this will help you understand what to do increase your SEO, but it's up to you to keep it up. So many people start off well and then their efforts drop off because they either forget or get lazy. To keep from falling into this trap, set a daily and weekly checklist for yourself. 3. Post good-looking, relevant content Look, posting a lot of content is great, but it has to actually matter. It's not enough to just get visitors to come to your site - you want them stay. AND come back! The way to do this is by posting thoughtful, relevant content that keeps them engaged with your site. Use videos, pictures, podcasts and make your content look visually appealing. The more enjoyable it is to read, the more likely your visitors will stick around. Neil Patel, author of Hustle, mentions that writing 3000+ word articles helps increase your long tail keyword count. This helps you get more links back to your content, which increases your search traffic. 4. Show authority As far as Google is concerned, this is the most important. You need to be getting links to your site from high traffic sites in order to prove your authority to the bots. There are a few ways to accomplish this. One option is subscribing to HARO (HelpaReporterOut.com) and responding to inquiries from journalists. If they use you as an expert source, they'll usually link to your website. Or, you could offer a testimonial on a high traffic website. You'd simply make a list of the products you use and reach out to those companies offering to give them a testimonial in exchange for them linking it to your website. 5. Fix broken links This one was news to me, but Chirag Kulkarni, co-founder of Taco, pointed out that broken links can actually get you penalized with Google. If you've been creating content long enough, chances are that you have some links on certain articles that no longer work. This means that articles about the same topics on other sites that don't have broken links are ranking higher than you. Remedy this by doing a monthly check of all your links to ensure everything's working properly. On a final note, don't get overwhelmed by SEO - instead, try seeing it as a game. It's actually kind of fun to go on your analytics page, see which days saw a spike in traffic, and figure out why. Constantly experiment with content and see what works - when you find what's working, amp it up! The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

A direct rival to Amazon Echo, Google Home is the company's entry into the smart home market. Large shops will find many reasons for making the switch. Businesses of other sizes might have to do a Read Now Want Google Home to play your favorite song? Just say, "OK, Google" and ask for it to play the music. Want the device, which is equipped with its artificial-intelligence based Assistant, to play that funny cat video from YouTube on your TV? You get the picture. Google Home is always listening for the phrase, "OK, Google" so it can take its instructions. The issue that has some people concerned is the phrase "always listening." Since Google collects information about what users are searching for online, what phrases they're using in their email, what directions they want in Maps and where they are day to day, what more information could it be collecting about what users are doing in their own homes? Could the new data being collected be even more personal? "There are plenty of privacy issues with this type of always listening technology," said Dan Olds, an analyst with OrionX, a technology analyst firm. "It's obvious that any device that is always listening could also be always storing and always analyzing anything that is within earshot of the receiver." Olds added that Google Home could help Google amass a whole new range of information about people. "It could give Google a hell of a lot more personal data about users than they get now," he said. "That microphone will be a witness to every verbal interaction in the home. It will also know what you watch on TV, what you listen to, and, obviously, when there's no one home." Google, however, told Computerworld that user privacy was foremost in designers' minds when they developed the device. "All the devices that come with the Google Assistant are designed with privacy in mind," said a Google spokesperson in an email. "We only process speech after the hotword "OK Google" is detected. If the hotword is not heard, the audio snippet stays local on the device and is discarded." The spokesperson did not say how long the information stays stored locally. However, she did note that users can access the data that has been collected about them by going to their My Activity page and delete what they don't want collected about them. What will Google do with the data collects from its home device? According to the company spokesperson, the device will use its audio history to learn the sound of users' voices, how specific users pronounce words and phrases and further improve speech recognition. She did not say what would be done with the data collected from things like music preferences and search questions. "Google claims that the information is only captured when you are making a request, but with all of the security problems we've had with technology in this class, baby monitors in particular, you sure wouldn't want anything like this someplace where security was a big concern, like in a conference room or lab, for instance," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with The Enderle Group. "In most cases, the exposure is likely more on whether it can tell and report on whether you are home or not, but with the alleged Yahoo email scanning scandal, the level of concern is, and likely should remain, high." Of course, Google has noted that users can press a Mute button on the Home device so it isn't always listening, but that diminishes the usefulness of the device. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said users should always be on guard. "To be on the safe side, consumers should assume Home is always listening," he said. "Google also didn't specify whether or not information mined through Home would be used to build advertising profiles. Consumers who want a high degree of privacy should be worried and do the due diligence to read privacy agreements." For Olds, Home simply has a high creepy factor. "I think that people will be creeped out by these systems as they become more sophisticated," he said. "Imagine that you were having a casual conversation with friends about adding a hot tub to your back yard. The next day, as you go about your digital business, you might find your email inbox full of ads for hot tubs, and all of the banners on your internet searches festooned with even more ads for hot tub dealers. Is the convenience offered by these products worth the highly targeted advertising that will be the end result? We'll see." Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said he's sure that Google Home will collect more information about users than the company had before. He's just not all that worried about it. "The reason I live with Google's having so much of my information is that it makes the services more useful to me, and I'm sure enough that it won't be revealed to anyone or used for anything other than advertising and responsiveness," he said. "I'm not totally sure, but it's a gamble I'm willing to take." Enderle noted that society is reaching a time when everything people do likely will be captured by someone. "I don't think we are ready for that eventuality yet," he said. He also had a piece of advice for anyone worried about Google Home collecting too much data about them. "Don't buy it."         LATEST STORIES (15) Syrian Army Continues to Beat Terrorists Back Form More Positions Southwest of Aleppo City Al-Nusra Executes Several FSA Militants South of Syria Xbox Scorpio vs. PS4 Pro: Which Is More Powerful?
