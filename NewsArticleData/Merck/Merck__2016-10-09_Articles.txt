Physical strain, emotional upset can trigger heart attack Intense physical exertion or extreme emotional upset can each trigger a heart attack, and the risk may be highest if the two are combined, according to a new study. "Our study is the largest study exploring this issue, and unlike previous studies we included people from many different countries and ethnicities," said lead author Andrew Smyth of the Population Health Research Institute at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Exelixis and Pfizer drugs compete in kidney cancer trial Exelixis's drug Cabometyx outperformed Pfizer's Sutent in a clinical study for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer, suggesting it has the potential to become a first-line treatment, researchers said on Monday. The drug is currently approved only in patients who have already received prior therapy, while Sutent is cleared for initial use. However, hopes have been building for the Exelixis product in recent months, buoying the firm's shares. Doctors grapple with best use of potent new cancer drugs Evelyn O'Flynn still has lung cancer. But after going straight on to a new immune system-boosting drug more than a year ago, rather than traditional hard-to-tolerate chemotherapy, she is feeling great. "It's like a miracle," said the 72-year-old ex-smoker, who is about to become a great-grandmother. As a patient being treated with Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda, O'Flynn is one of the lucky ones. Niger Rift Valley Fever outbreak could spread across borders: health experts An outbreak of Rift Valley fever that has killed at least 28 people in western Niger in recent months could spread to neighboring Mali and Algeria, health officials warned on Monday. The highly contagious disease, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or close contact with contaminated animals, has infected 90 people in Niger's western region of Tahoua since early August, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Britain's young royals mark World Mental Health day at London Eye Britain's Prince William, his wife Kate and brother Harry took a ride on the giant London Eye ferris wheel on Monday as they helped mark World Mental Health Day. The young royals rode in a capsule with guests who previously experienced mental health problems. The three royals front the Heads Together campaign, launched this year to help improve the help available for sufferers. Antibiotic history of a hospital bed may increase a patient's risk of infection If the previous occupant of a hospital bed received antibiotics, the next patient who uses that bed may be at higher risk for a severe form of infectious diarrhea, according to a new study. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea causes 27,000 deaths each year in the U.S. Hospital patients taking antibiotics are particularly at risk for it, say the authors of the study. Antibiotics disturb the normal healthy bacteria of the gut so a C. diff infection can take hold. 'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. Ventilator use surges for nursing home residents with dementia The number of nursing home residents with advanced dementia who get hooked up to breathing machines has roughly doubled in recent years even though this doesn't appear to help them live longer, a U.S. study suggests. In 2013, among every 1,000 nursing home residents with dementia who needed to be hospitalized for some reason, 78 were hooked up to mechanical ventilators, compared to just 39 out of 1,000 in 2000, the study found. Bristol lung-cancer setback puts rival Merck drug in driver seat New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co's rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday. The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent. The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them.

By EmmaCourt Reporter Rival drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Merck & Co., which are both developing a treatment for the same type of lung cancer, have been playing a game of stock market seesaw. Never was that more true than Monday, when Merck’s MRK, -1.55%  positive clinical trial data lifted it a mere 1.6%, while Bristol’s BMY, -0.51%  bad news — made worse in contrast with Merck’s — sent it shuddering down 10.6%. Merck announced two positive clinical trial results on Sunday, both for its Keytruda treatment on metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and published the results in respected journals on Monday. “Our new data suggests that Keytruda treatment can offer meaningful improvement over chemotherapy in a broad array of patients,” said Merck president Dr. Roger Perlmutter. “In this sense, these studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer.” By contrast, Bristol announced that its Opdivo treatment showed “ongoing responses” in two late-stage studies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, less-than-impressive results following a high-profile trial failure in early August. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Keytruda’s results support Perlmutter’s assertion of a “sea change” in this area of cancer treatment. “The nearly inexplicable failure of [Bristol’s] (OP) CM-026 at every level of PDL1 expression... puts MRK in the driver’s seat in 1L lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months,” he said, adding that, “we fully expect [Merck] to retain a significant place at the table long term.” Though some support for an Opdivo comeback remained after the drug’s summer trial failure, analysts had harsher words this go-around. See: Why Bristol-Myers lung-cancer drug could still succeed despite stunning trial failure The weekend Opdivo results were “even worse than expected,” said EvercoreISI’s Paul Sperber. Though more than half of investors expected a comparison between the two drugs to “come in somewhat even... Instead, we saw virtually no benefit for BMY’s” Opdivo, Sperber said. But J.P. Morgan’s Chris Schott made a case for a Bristol recovery, saying that while the latest results were “wholly disappointing, we see sentiment bottoming as we move past ESMO and continue to see an attractive long-term thesis” based on the study of Opdivo in combination with cancer drug Yervoy, which he said was Bristol’s “path forward in the lung.” Read: Failed trial of lung-cancer drug sends Bristol-Myers stock plunging and Merck’s shares up Though Schott was bullish on Merck’s Keytruda, predicting a very rapid uptake and rollout of the drug, he remained “optimistic” on the Opdivo/Yervoy combination being an “extremely competitive combo frontline” for non-small cell lung cancer. The FDA plans to consider Keytruda for approval, with a decision expected by Dec. 24, Merck said. While Bristol has said it wants to file early for approval for Opdivo/Yervoy, it “provided little in the way of detail regarding timelines and the rationale for such a filing,” said Schott. “We expect the Street to remain skeptical of a potential early Opdivo/Yervoy” absent additional data. Merck shares have risen 7.5% over the past three months, compared with a 1.6% increase in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.14% Bristol-Myers shares have dropped 34.1% over the past three months.

The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent. The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. "This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor's level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. "Merck will completely 'own' the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really," Anderson said. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now. In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage. "The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver's seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months," said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Calling the Keytruda data "stunning," Fernandez said, "We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term." Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high. Opdivo is also approved for advanced melanoma, kidney cancer and a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, while Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, plus head and neck cancer. But lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.

COPENHAGEN:  Evelyn O'Flynn still has lung cancer. But after going straight on to a new immune system-boosting drug more than a year ago, rather than traditional hard-to-tolerate chemotherapy, she is feeling great. "It's like a miracle," said the 72-year-old ex-smoker, who is about to become a great-grandmother. As a patient being treated with Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda, O'Flynn is one of the lucky ones. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress suggest her early treatment with immunotherapy, as part of a clinical trial in Britain, will become standard for a growing number of patients. But there is a catch: it doesn't work for all. Giving immunotherapy on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. From now on, oncologists in Copenhagen have been told, lung cancer patients should be routinely tested for this biomarker. However, only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumours with at least 50 per cent of cells producing PD-L1, leaving the majority unserved and around 70 percent of the market still up for grabs. The inability to treat everyone with monotherapy using one single drug is a blow for Bristol, which tried to make treatment with its Opdivo drug work across the board, only to fail comprehensively in a major clinical trial. But it has opened up the field to rivals like Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca, which own what could be among the biggest-selling drugs of all time, and all companies are now racing to find smart ways to combine treatments. Oncologists poring over immunotherapy trial results at Europe's biggest cancer meeting have learnt one thing: finding optimal treatments for different patient groups will take more research. "I think the future of immunotherapy will be defined over the next 10 or 15 years," said lung cancer specialist Solange Peters from Lausanne University Hospital, one of the organisers of the Copenhagen meeting. Despite immunotherapy successes and the prospect of a potential market worth up to $40 billion in sales, veteran cancer experts urge caution. "In oncology, we see these kind of waves from cosmic pessimism to over-optimism, so we have to be cautious," ESMO President Fortunato Ciardiello said. Investors, though, were quick to position themselves as shares in Bristol fell 10 per cent in early trade on Monday, while Merck hit its highest level since 2001. FIGHTING BACK By taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours, immunotherapy offers a different approach to toxic chemotherapy treatment, which causes collateral damage to healthy tissue. It is not without side effects but it is a kinder option, which also promises much longer-lasting efficacy. Bristol, Merck and Roche have US approval for immunotherapies, while Bristol and Merck also sell their drugs in Europe. China, however, has yet to licence them. Lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, will account for by far the largest portion of future prescriptions, although immunotherapy is used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck. With Merck set to sweep the board in lung cancer monotherapy, doctors are looking to the next phase of the story and there is a growing consensus that combination treatments are the future for remaining patients with lower PD-L1 levels. "Clearly, the race is on," said Jean-Charles Soria, a professor of medicine at France's Institut Gustave Roussy, of the looming battle for dominance in the combination market. In theory, researchers believe, it should be possible to get more people to respond by adding other drugs to the mix in order to coax the immune system to fight back against cancer cells. Most attention so far has been on combining two immunotherapies, although this raises questions over cost, with each medicine typically priced at $100,000 to $150,000 a year. The strategy creates an opportunity for AstraZeneca, which has lagged rivals so far but hopes to jump ahead with a drug cocktail that should report clinical results early next year. Bristol is chasing the same idea, although its double-immunotherapy trial is not expected to have results until 2018. But the ESMO meeting has also raised the prospect of another approach -- successfully combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy. A lot of scientists have been sceptical of this idea in the past, and there are still questions over whether patients will have a long-lasting response, but positive data from a mid-stage study at ESMO suggests the concept has real promise. Roche and Merck are both enthusiastic. Steering a path through all these permutations is going to be a challenge and ESMO's Ciardiello says the cancer community must await more clinical trial results over the next few years. "I think we live in great times for rendering cancer a curable disease but it will take time because the more we learn, the more we understand that it is hugely complex," he told Reuters. $30-40 BILLION SALES While nobody yet knows what the "gold standard" treatment regimen is going to be, it is already clear this new generation of drugs is going to be big. "Every time we come back to the immunotherapy market we are amazed at just how large the opportunity is," said Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, who sees combined annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion for drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo, as well as rivals from Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. How the market will ultimately divide between companies is still unclear but Merck certainly emerges from the past weekend in Copenhagen as the main winner. That underscores a shift in expectations that has been evident since August, when Bristol first revealed its monotherapy trial had failed. British patient O'Flynn, whose tumours shrunk dramatically, is just glad she has a chance to try something new. "My brother had cancer and he had chemotherapy, which was very gruelling. But I haven't experienced any real side effects, apart from a bit of tiredness." © Thomson Reuters 2016 Trending Movies: 10 Sharp Quotes From Twinkle Khanna To NDTV Profit: How Big Note Ban Could Impact Your EMIs, Bank FD Rates Gadgets: Sony Xperia XZ Review Related Weight Loss May Make Cancer Immunotherapies Ineffective Smoking a Pack a Day Causes 150 Mutations in Every Lung Cell Palliative Care Should be Standard in Cancer Treatment: Guideline Antibiotic History Of A Hospital Bed May Increase A Patient's Risk Of Infection: Study Dear Science: Why Do I Always Get Sick When The Seasons Change?

Merck had said in June that  Keytruda beat chemotherapy in a survival advantage for patients with advanced lung cancer, but did not provide details.  At a medical meeting Sunday, Merck said Keytruda extended progression-free survival to 10.3 months, compared with six months for those on chemotherapy. The stock rose $1.13 to close at $63.90.  "Chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for decades, but survival rates remain low," said Roger M. Perlmutter, vice president of Merck Research Laboratories. "These studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer." The results,  presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, were a victory for Merck, whose competitor in the same class of cancer medicines is Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Bristol announced in August that Opdivo had missed its mark in a first-line patient trial, failing to outperform chemotherapy. Merck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., employs about 9,200 in West Point and Upper Gwynedd in Montgomery County. The trial was restricted to patients whose lung tumors contained a PD-L1 protein. Keytruda, a monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's iKmmune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, is already approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients in the latest study had not been treated previously for their disease. The Food and Drug Administration has granted "breakthrough therapy designation" for Keytruda to treat relapsed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, a blood cancer; advanced melanoma;  colorectal cancer; and non-small-cell lung cancer. The designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, "demonstrate the potential of Keytruda to change the way non-small-cell lung cancer is currently treated," said Martin Reck, head of the thoracic oncology  department at Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf in Germany.  More Coverage Will Merck (MRK) Stock Be Helped as Keytruda Meets Goal?

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co's rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday. The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent. The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. "This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor's level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. "Merck will completely 'own' the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really," Anderson said. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now. In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage. "The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver's seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months," said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Calling the Keytruda data "stunning,” Fernandez said, "We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term." Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high. Opdivo is also approved for advanced melanoma, kidney cancer and a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, while Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, plus head and neck cancer. But lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.

This sector in particular can be very volatile, but this is the nature of the beast. When clinical trials signal that a drug has the green light, shares can jump. But conversely, a failed trial can spell disaster for a company. Below we have included information about these three companies, as well as recent trading activity and the consensus price target. Merck Prior to its presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) announced that Keytruda (pembrolizumab), demonstrated superiority in overall survival (OS) at 18 months compared to standard of care chemotherapy (docetaxel) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy whose tumors expressed PD-L1, as well as patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression. Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven, commented: These findings – which show superior survival with longer follow-up across patients with PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of one percent or more), as well as improved quality of life – point to KEYTRUDA as a durable treatment option for many previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. These data also reinforce the value of using PD-L1 as a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA. Merck shares were trading up 2% at $64.04 on Monday. The stock has a consensus analyst price target of $66.21 and a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86. Mylan Shares of Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ: MYL) traded higher on Monday following the announcement that the company has settled with the U.S. Department of Justice. It has agreed to pay a settlement of $465 million in regards to the classification of its EpiPen Auto-Injector for the purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Ultimately the stock is up because investors thought that this settlement would be worse for Mylan. Keep in mind that Mylan has a total market cap of roughly $21 billion. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented: This agreement is another important step in Mylan’s efforts to move forward and bring resolution to all EpiPen Auto-Injector related matters. The agreement is in addition to the significant steps Mylan has taken in relation to EpiPen Auto-Injector over the past several weeks, including the unprecedented, pending launch of a generic version of EpiPen Auto-Injector and expansion of our patient access programs for this product. Entering into this settlement is the right course of action at this time for the Company, its stakeholders and the Medicaid program. Shares of Mylan were trading up over 8% at $38.96, with a consensus price target of $55.41 and a 52-week range of $35.58 to $55.51. Bristol-Myers Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) updated results at the ESMO from two pivotal Phase 3 studies, CheckMate -057 and CheckMate -017, which showed more than one-third of previously treated metastatic NSCLC patients in both trials experienced ongoing responses with Opdivo, compared to no ongoing responses in the docetaxel arm. There were no new safety signals identified for Opdivo in the pooled ies. No new treatment-related deaths occurred between one and two years’ minimum follow-up despite the longer treatment exposure, and new events were observed in 11/418 patients with an additional one year of follow up. The median duration of response (DOR) with Opdivo versus docetaxel in CheckMate -057 was 17.2 months and 5.6 months, respectively, and in CheckMate -017 it was 25.2 months and 8.4 months, respectively. Shares of Bristol Myers were down nearly 10% at $50.00, with a consensus price target of $67.05 and a 52-week range of $49.92 to $77.12.

The drug targets the programmed cell death 1 (or PD-1) receptor and allows the body's own immune system go after the cancer cells. Merck, the maker of Keytruda, just finished a new trial on the drug, for patients who haven't yet been treated for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference. About a third of all these patients with non-small cell lung cancer have cells that express at least 50% of this PD-L1 protein (which relates to the PD-1 receptor the drug is targeting).  The 305 patients who ting).  The 305 patients who took part in the trial were either assigned Keytruda or platinum-based chemotherapy. Progression-free survival — a clinical endpoint that basically means the cancer hasn't grown — was a median of 10.3 months in those who received Keytruda, while those in the chemotherapy group had a median progression-free survival of 6 months. The overall survival rate at six months for those on Keytruda was 80.2%, while it was 72% for chemotherapy. "All these data taken together really represent a sea change in the treatment of the lung cancer patient," Merck's senior vice president of clinical development, Roy Baynes told Business Insider, referring to this trial, as well as another that looked at what happens when chemotherapy is combined with immunotherapy. This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that immunotherapy is better than standard chemotherapy as a first treatment for people with this type of lung cancer, he said. Steep competition Keytruda isn't the only PD-1 drug trying to prove it works for this group of lung cancer patients. In August, Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company with a competing drug called Opdivo said its version of the study didn't hit its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with at least 5% PD-L1 expression in tumors (a wider net than what Merck's was looking at). Bristol-Myers also presented data at the ESMO conference and fell short of expectations that it would at least do well in patients with high levels of PD-L1 protein. The company's stock was down 8% Monday morning, while Merck was up 2%.  Both Opdivo (nivolumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) are approved for a seemingly ever-growing list of cancer types. And they're not cheap. Opdivo brought in $840 million in second-quarter sales alone, while Keytruda made $314 million over the same time period. "It might well be that Keytruda monotherapy in high PDL1 expressers remains the go-to regimen, representing a high bar for combination therapy to cross," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note Friday, before the full data was released. But, although there is a lot of excitement over new immunotherapies like these two, there's still a lot that needs to be figured out about how these treatments work and who will respond to them.  "Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors will displace chemotherapy in yet another subset of patients with lung cancer," Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute wrote in an editorial published Sunday in NEJM. "We await the results of long-term follow-up of large cohorts of patients who were treated with another checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, to see whether the initial survival data advantage in the population translates to survival of 20% or greater at 3 years and beyond."

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:10 AM, October 11, 2016 Updated: 1:50 PM, October 11, 2016 New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co's rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday. The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent. The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. "This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor's level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. "Merck will completely 'own' the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really," Anderson said. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now. In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage. "The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver's seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months," said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Calling the Keytruda data "stunning,” Fernandez said, "We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term." Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high. Opdivo is also approved for advanced melanoma, kidney cancer and a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, while Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, plus head and neck cancer. But lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:35 PM, October 10, 2016 COPENHAGEN - Evelyn O’Flynn still has lung cancer. But after going straight on to a new immune system-boosting drug more than a year ago, rather than traditional hard-to-tolerate chemotherapy, she is feeling great. "It’s like a miracle," said the 72-year-old ex-smoker, who is about to become a great-grandmother. As a patient being treated with Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda, O’Flynn is one of the lucky ones. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress suggest her early treatment with immunotherapy, as part of a clinical trial in Britain, will become standard for a growing number of patients. But there is a catch: it doesn't work for all. Giving immunotherapy on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. From now on, oncologists in Copenhagen have been told, lung cancer patients should be routinely tested for this biomarker. However, only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, leaving the majority unserved and around 70 percent of the market still up for grabs. The inability to treat everyone with monotherapy using one single drug is a blow for Bristol, which tried to make treatment with its Opdivo drug work across the board, only to fail comprehensively in a major clinical trial. But it has opened up the field to rivals like Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca, which own what could be among the biggest-selling drugs of all time, and all companies are now racing to find smart ways to combine treatments. Oncologists poring over immunotherapy trial results at Europe's biggest cancer meeting have learnt one thing: finding optimal treatments for different patient groups will take more research. "I think the future of immunotherapy will be defined over the next 10 or 15 years," said lung cancer specialist Solange Peters from Lausanne University Hospital, one of the organizers of the Copenhagen meeting. Despite immunotherapy successes and the prospect of a potential market worth up to $40 billion in sales, veteran cancer experts urge caution. "In oncology, we see these kind of waves from cosmic pessimism to over-optimism, so we have to be cautious," ESMO President Fortunato Ciardiello said. Investors, though, were quick to position themselves as shares in Bristol fell 10 percent in early trade on Monday, while Merck hit its highest level since 2001. FIGHTING BACK By taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors, immunotherapy offers a different approach to toxic chemotherapy treatment, which causes collateral damage to healthy tissue. It is not without side effects but it is a kinder option, which also promises much longer-lasting efficacy. Bristol, Merck and Roche have U.S. approval for immunotherapies, while Bristol and Merck also sell their drugs in Europe. China, however, has yet to license them. Lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, will account for by far the largest portion of future prescriptions, although immunotherapy is used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck. With Merck set to sweep the board in lung cancer monotherapy, doctors are looking to the next phase of the story and there is a growing consensus that combination treatments are the future for remaining patients with lower PD-L1 levels. "Clearly, the race is on," said Jean-Charles Soria, a professor of medicine at France's Institut Gustave Roussy, of the looming battle for dominance in the combination market. In theory, researchers believe, it should be possible to get more people to respond by adding other drugs to the mix in order to coax the immune system to fight back against cancer cells. Most attention so far has been on combining two immunotherapies, although this raises questions over cost, with each medicine typically priced at $100,000 to $150,000 a year. The strategy creates an opportunity for AstraZeneca, which has lagged rivals so far but hopes to jump ahead with a drug cocktail that should report clinical results early next year. Bristol is chasing the same idea, although its double-immunotherapy trial is not expected to have results until 2018. But the ESMO meeting has also raised the prospect of another approach -- successfully combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy. A lot of scientists have been sceptical of this idea in the past, and there are still questions over whether patients will have a long-lasting response, but positive data from a mid-stage study at ESMO suggests the concept has real promise. Roche and Merck are both enthusiastic. Steering a path through all these permutations is going to be a challenge and ESMO's Ciardiello says the cancer community must await more clinical trial results over the next few years. "I think we live in great times for rendering cancer a curable disease but it will take time because the more we learn, the more we understand that it is hugely complex," he told Reuters. $30-40 BILLION SALES While nobody yet knows what the "gold standard" treatment regimen is going to be, it is already clear this new generation of drugs is going to be big. "Every time we come back to the immunotherapy market we are amazed at just how large the opportunity is," said Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, who sees combined annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion for drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo, as well as rivals from Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. How the market will ultimately divide between companies is still unclear but Merck certainly emerges from the past weekend in Copenhagen as the main winner. That underscores a shift in expectations that has been evident since August, when Bristol first revealed its monotherapy trial had failed.

Adam Feuerstein Oct 9, 2016 7:50 AM EDT Merck (MRK) will emerge victorious from a European medical conference this weekend with the only immunotherapy, Keytruda, shown to significantly delay tumor growth and extend the lives of patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer compared to chemotherapy. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) leaves the same conference with a competing immunotherapy, Opdivo, that's a total failure in newly diagnosed lung cancer. There was speculation Bristol might salvage something positive for Opdivo from the negative clinical trial first announced in August. That didn't happen, so now Bristol is in a bad place. Bristol has already lost $32 billion in market value since announcing in August the failure of the Opdivo front-line lung cancer trial. In the same time period, Merck's market value has increased by $14 billion.This weekend's cancer immunotherapy duel isn't likely to reverse that valuation trend. Keytruda and Opdivo are both highly effective and commercially successful drugs which harness a patient's immune system to kill a growing list of cancer types. Both drugs are even effective in treating patients with lung cancer that no longer responds to prior therapies. However, in newly diagnosed lung cancer, a commercial market opportunity that could reach $8 billion in sales annually, Merck's Keytruda works and Bristol's Opdivo does not. Why? Because Bristol gambled big by testing Opdivo in a broad population of new lung cancer patients. The bet blew up. Merck played conservative, choosing to target a smaller group of lung cancer patients with a biomarker suggesting Keytruda would be more effective. Merck's strategy paid off. Keytruda and Opdivo belong to a class of drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. They work by blocking the interaction between PD-L1, a protein found on the surface of tumor cells, with PD-1, a receptor found on immune cells. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 connection allows a patient's immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Merck restricted enrollment in its phase III study to previously untreated patients with at least 50% of lung tumors cells expressing PD-L1. Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients have this biomarker. The patients were randomized to receive treatment with Keytruda or a physician's choice of five different chemotherapy regimens. For the study's primary endpoint, Keytruda reduced the risk of tumor progression by 50% compared to chemotherapy. At the median, Keytruda delayed tumor growth by 10.3 months compared to 6 months for chemotherapy.

Bristol Myers’ own immunotherapy treatment, Opdivo, failed its phase III trial for non-small cell lung cancer in August with no improvement in previously untreated patients. Over the weekend, however, Merck said that Keytruda halved the rate of disease progression and reduced the number of deaths by 40%. In combination with established chemotherapy drugs, meanwhile, it was twice as effective as chemotherapy alone. A spokesman for the university where the research was carried out said the results may have marked a new day for lung cancer treatment. Merck had already announced that Keytruda had performed well in the trial, but this was the first time the data had been published. Keytruda is part of the new wave of immunotherapy boosting treatments for cancer that enable the body to recognise rogue cells and destroy them. Lung cancer is seen a US$10bn plus market and while Opdivo is approved for other treatments, its failure here has wiped billions off Bristol Myer’s value. Shares today were 9% lower at US$50.3 as analysts suggested it may now never catch up Merck, with Keytruda set to become the new standard of care. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Other recent news in Business FACEBOOK just bought CrowdTangle, a tool that publishers use to dominate social media (FB) China SINGLES Day : Alibaba hits $1bn of sales in less than five minutes Alibaba Says It Smashed Sales Records On China's 'SINGLES DAY' Retailer rakes in $2 million in 13 minutes thanks to Chinese SHOPPING festival POLICE begin football corruption probe DEMONETISATION: Railways to accept Rs 500/1000 notes till November 14 Tatas move to oust Cyrus Mistry from TATA MOTORS, Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals German economy likely grew in Q3 despite BREXIT Pipeline company offers to help pay costs to police PROTESTS GRUBHUB CEO: If you agree with Trump, resign Twitter Facebook Page People Donald Trump Robert Vaughn Mark Zuckerberg Chris Christie Barack Obama Current Topics Veterans Day Facebook Grubhub CEO Fantasy Football George Zimmerman Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories Will Michelle Obama Run For President In 2020?

Annie Palmer Oct 10, 2016 10:27 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) were retreating 9.34% to $50.26 on heavy trading volume mid-morning Monday after Merck (MRK) released positive results from its Keytruda lung cancer drug trial.  Bristol-Myers is developing a similar drug called Opdivo, which is for newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer patients. In August, the New York-based pharmaceutical company reported negative late-stage trial results for Opdivo when compared with chemotherapy.  The difference between the two trials is that Kenilworth, NJ-based Merck limited its study to patients with at least 50% of lung tumors containing PD-L1, a protein found on tumor cells. Opdivo included patients with tumors containing lower levels of PD-L1.  TheStreet's Adam Feuerstein said the risk of dying in the Bristol study was the same whether a patient was treated with Opdivo or chemo.  But Leerink believes Bristol-Myers can still compete with Merck despite the company's disappointing Opdivo results. Bristol-Myers said it "may have a fast track" to getting Opdivo approved, but Leerink noted that such a path seems "speculative" based on Merck's "stunning" Keytruda trial.  The firm has an "outperform" rating on Bristol-Myers stock. More than 17.33 million of Bristol-Myers' shares have changed hands so far today vs. its average volume of 11.99 million shares per day.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo 4/4 By Ben Hirschler | COPENHAGEN COPENHAGEN Evelyn O’Flynn still has lung cancer. But after going straight on to a new immune system-boosting drug more than a year ago, rather than traditional hard-to-tolerate chemotherapy, she is feeling great. "It’s like a miracle," said the 72-year-old ex-smoker, who is about to become a great-grandmother. As a patient being treated with Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda, O’Flynn is one of the lucky ones. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress suggest her early treatment with immunotherapy, as part of a clinical trial in Britain, will become standard for a growing number of patients. But there is a catch: it doesn't work for all. Giving immunotherapy on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. From now on, oncologists in Copenhagen have been told, lung cancer patients should be routinely tested for this biomarker. However, only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, leaving the majority unserved and around 70 percent of the market still up for grabs. The inability to treat everyone with monotherapy using one single drug is a blow for Bristol, which tried to make treatment with its Opdivo drug work across the board, only to fail comprehensively in a major clinical trial. But it has opened up the field to rivals like Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca, which own what could be among the biggest-selling drugs of all time, and all companies are now racing to find smart ways to combine treatments. Oncologists poring over immunotherapy trial results at Europe's biggest cancer meeting have learnt one thing: finding optimal treatments for different patient groups will take more research. "I think the future of immunotherapy will be defined over the next 10 or 15 years," said lung cancer specialist Solange Peters from Lausanne University Hospital, one of the organizers of the Copenhagen meeting. Despite immunotherapy successes and the prospect of a potential market worth up to $40 billion in sales, veteran cancer experts urge caution. "In oncology, we see these kind of waves from cosmic pessimism to over-optimism, so we have to be cautious," ESMO President Fortunato Ciardiello said. Investors, though, were quick to position themselves as shares in Bristol fell 10 percent in early trade on Monday, while Merck hit its highest level since 2001. FIGHTING BACK By taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors, immunotherapy offers a different approach to toxic chemotherapy treatment, which causes collateral damage to healthy tissue. It is not without side effects but it is a kinder option, which also promises much longer-lasting efficacy. Bristol, Merck and Roche have U.S. approval for immunotherapies, while Bristol and Merck also sell their drugs in Europe. China, however, has yet to license them. Lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, will account for by far the largest portion of future prescriptions, although immunotherapy is used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck. With Merck set to sweep the board in lung cancer monotherapy, doctors are looking to the next phase of the story and there is a growing consensus that combination treatments are the future for remaining patients with lower PD-L1 levels. "Clearly, the race is on," said Jean-Charles Soria, a professor of medicine at France's Institut Gustave Roussy, of the looming battle for dominance in the combination market. In theory, researchers believe, it should be possible to get more people to respond by adding other drugs to the mix in order to coax the immune system to fight back against cancer cells. Most attention so far has been on combining two immunotherapies, although this raises questions over cost, with each medicine typically priced at $100,000 to $150,000 a year. The strategy creates an opportunity for AstraZeneca, which has lagged rivals so far but hopes to jump ahead with a drug cocktail that should report clinical results early next year. Bristol is chasing the same idea, although its double-immunotherapy trial is not expected to have results until 2018. But the ESMO meeting has also raised the prospect of another approach -- successfully combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy. A lot of scientists have been sceptical of this idea in the past, and there are still questions over whether patients will have a long-lasting response, but positive data from a mid-stage study at ESMO suggests the concept has real promise.

"Every time we come back to the immunotherapy market we are amazed at just how large the opportunity is," said Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, who sees combined annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion for drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo, as well as rivals from Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

But after going straight on to a new immune system-boosting drug more than a year ago, rather than traditional hard-to-tolerate chemotherapy, she is feeling great. "It's like a miracle," said the 72-year-old ex-smoker, who is about to become a great-grandmother. As a patient being treated with Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda, O'Flynn is one of the lucky ones. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress suggest her early treatment with immunotherapy, as part of a clinical trial in Britain, will become standard for a growing number of patients. But there is a catch: it doesn't work for all. Giving immunotherapy on its own only seems to work better than chemotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients who have high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. From now on, oncologists in Copenhagen have been told, lung cancer patients should be routinely tested for this biomarker. However, only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumours with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, leaving the majority unserved and around 70 percent of the market still up for grabs. The inability to treat everyone with monotherapy using one single drug is a blow for Bristol, which tried to make treatment with its Opdivo drug work across the board, only to fail comprehensively in a major clinical trial. But it has opened up the field to rivals like Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca, which own what could be among the biggest-selling drugs of all time, and all companies are now racing to find smart ways to combine treatments. Oncologists poring over immunotherapy trial results at Europe's biggest cancer meeting have learnt one thing: finding optimal treatments for different patient groups will take more research. "I think the future of immunotherapy will be defined over the next 10 or 15 years," said lung cancer specialist Solange Peters from Lausanne University Hospital, one of the organisers of the Copenhagen meeting. Despite immunotherapy successes and the prospect of a potential market worth up to $40 billion in sales, veteran cancer experts urge caution. "In oncology, we see these kind of waves from cosmic pessimism to over-optimism, so we have to be cautious," ESMO President Fortunato Ciardiello said. Investors, though, were quick to position themselves as shares in Bristol fell 10 percent in early trade on Monday, while Merck hit its highest level since 2001. FIGHTING BACK By taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours, immunotherapy offers a different approach to toxic chemotherapy treatment, which causes collateral damage to healthy tissue. It is not without side effects but it is a kinder option, which also promises much longer-lasting efficacy. Bristol, Merck and Roche have U.S. approval for immunotherapies, while Bristol and Merck also sell their drugs in Europe. China, however, has yet to licence them. Lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, will account for by far the largest portion of future prescriptions, although immunotherapy is used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck. With Merck set to sweep the board in lung cancer monotherapy, doctors are looking to the next phase of the story and there is a growing consensus that combination treatments are the future for remaining patients with lower PD-L1 levels. "Clearly, the race is on," said Jean-Charles Soria, a professor of medicine at France's Institut Gustave Roussy, of the looming battle for dominance in the combination market. In theory, researchers believe, it should be possible to get more people to respond by adding other drugs to the mix in order to coax the immune system to fight back against cancer cells.

The results were in stark contrast to the performance of Merck & Co.’s Keytruda in a similar group of patients. Keytruda reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 percent in a study, giving Merck a head start on all of its competitors in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors, the most common cancer in the world. Bristol-Myers shares, which had already slumped 19 percent this year through Friday, fell 9 percent to $50.43 at 10:18 a.m. in New York. Merck gained 2.1 percent to $64.10. In results presented Sunday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen, Opdivo data showed it wasn’t superior to chemotherapy even in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which is thought to be a predictor of how well the immune-system drugs will work. The data came from a detailed analysis of the Checkmate-26 study, whose main findings were released in August, causing Bristol-Myers’ stock to slump. Merck’s entire trial was designed around people with high PD-L1 levels, while Bristol-Myers tried to reach a wider range of patients. Bristol-Myers had already announced in August that Opdivo didn’t help the broader group. Sunday’s results showed the treatment didn’t aid the narrower group either. More Women The results were “below expectations,” wrote John Scotti, an analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. Imbalances in the trial, where more women and more people with high PD-L1 levels got chemotherapy, may have skewed the results, said Nick Botwood, the company’s development lead for lung cancer. “The study was designed to ask a very specific question at the 5 percent expression,” Botwood said during a conference call after the data presentation. “It wasn’t designed to ask a question at 50 percent.” He was referring to a measure of how prominent the PD-L1 biomarkers are in a patient’s cancer -- with 50 percent being considered a high level. Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said Bristol-Myers shouldn’t be written off just yet. “No one believes that Opdivo is dead in first-line,” Fazeli said in an e-mail. “It’s a drug that has worked in many settings. It’s just that the trial had so many aspects that apparently worked against it.” Merck and Bristol-Myers have been battling for dominance in the new field of immune-oncology, in which medicines are designed to boost the body’s own defenses against cancer. Both drugmakers’ medicines are already approved for people whose lung cancer got worse after initial treatment. The trials presented Sunday would form the basis for approval or rejection as an initial treatment in lung cancer, a much bigger group of potential patients, and could be good news for Merck. “With the right tactical moves, Merck can turn Keytruda into the broadest offering in lung cancer,” said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Cancer Merck & Co Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:05 PM, October 10, 2016 Updated: 6:09 PM, October 10, 2016 BERLIN — Lung cancer treatment is moving beyond chemotherapy, with Merck & Co setting the pace in a new category of therapies that harness the body’s immune system to fight tumours. The American company’s drug, Keytruda, reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 per cent, Merck said, unveiling details of a crucial study at a meeting in Copenhagen of the European Society for Medical Oncology. The medicine gave patients an average of 10.3 months before their cancer progressed, compared with six months on chemotherapy. Unlike its competitor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose similar drug Opdivo failed in an advanced trial and caused its stock to plunge, Merck selected patients who harboured high levels of a protein that’s thought to predict how well the immune-system drugs will work. The results gave Merck a head start — and not just on Bristol-Myers. Roche Holding and AstraZeneca are also in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumours, the most common cancer in the world. Doctors will probably start testing patients soon after diagnosis to see whether they’re suited to treatment with Keytruda and can forgo the many side effects of chemotherapy, said Mr Stefan Zimmermann, a chief oncologist at the Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg, Switzerland. “The main reaction will actually be relief and renewed hope,” Mr Zimmermann said on Sunday (Oct 9) from the meeting. “We have been waiting for ways to ditch the good old chemotherapy that carries significant toxicity.” The United States’ Food and Drug Administration is set to decide by Dec 24 whether Keytruda, already approved for patients whose lung cancer got worse after chemotherapy, can be used as an initial treatment too. Some 224,000 Americans will probably be diagnosed with lung tumours this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Much of the battle for dominance in lung immune-oncology drugs thus far has centred on whether patients need to show high levels of a protein called PD-L1 to benefit. Merck’s trial focused on patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 at least half the time. That group could comprise as many as one-quarter of newly-diagnosed lung-cancer patients, said Mr Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. By contrast, Bristol-Myers’s competing therapy, Opdivo, failed a test as a sole treatment for lung cancer after the company included patients with lower levels of PD-L1. But details of the trial unveiled at the conference pointed to lacklustre results even in a narrower group of patients with high PD-L1 levels. “PD-L1 assessment has to be part of the standard diagnostic workup,” said Mr Corey Langer, director of the thoracic oncology program at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “Patients can’t wait for these results.” Mr Langer led a smaller trial of Merck’s Keytruda also presented in Copenhagen, which combined the drug with chemotherapy and also let in all patients, no matter their PD-L1 levels. The combination was almost twice as successful at shrinking lung cancer tumours than a standard chemotherapy regimen. But with just 123 patients, the trial was too small to say for sure whether the combination is better than immune therapy alone, Langer said. Roche also presented results showing its immune therapy contender, Tecentriq, helped patients whose lung tumours had already progressed. Tecentriq was approved by regulators in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the FDA in second-line lung cancer by the end of next week. However, results for newly-diagnosed patients aren’t expected before 2018. By then, Mr Fazeli said, investors will be focusing on combination therapies. The first results from two immune therapies used together will probably come next year from AstraZeneca. Bristol-Myers is also working on such a combination, with data due out in 2018. Like Merck, Roche is combining its immune-oncology drug with chemotherapy, aiming for approval in 2018. “Given the data you see here with Keytruda alone, the combinations should by logic and by data seem to do better,” Mr Fazeli said.

 UPDATE 1-'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo Reuters Oct. 9, 2016, 5:15 AM 710 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Keytruda cuts risk of death 40 pct in big lung cancer study * Drug also improves outcomes when given with chemotherapy * Immunotherapy changing standard of care in cancer (Adds further comment from researchers) By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

The medicine gave patients an average of 10.3 months before their cancer progressed, compared with six months on chemotherapy. Unlike competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose similar drug Opdivo failed in an advanced trial and caused its stock to plunge, Merck selected patients who harbored high levels of a protein thought to predict how well the immune-system drugs will work. The results give Merck a head start -- and not just on Bristol-Myers. Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors, the most common cancer in the world. While Merck and Bristol-Myers are the leaders, each of the four companies will probably be able to take a piece of the market as data emerges from single and combination therapies for patients with various levels of the predictive protein, said Mirjam Heeb, who helps manage $186 million in health-care stocks, including Bristol-Myers, Roche and Merck, at GAM Holding AG in Zurich. Changing Landscape “We can assume now that Merck has a lead of at least 12 months” in its target patient group, Heeb said in a telephone interview. “But the overall landscape is changing so fast that I think it’s impossible to predict what it will look like in 12 months.” Doctors will probably start testing patients soon after diagnosis to see whether they’re suited to treatment with Keytruda and can forgo the many side effects of chemotherapy, said Stefan Zimmermann, a chief oncologist at the Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg, Switzerland. “The main reaction will actually be relief and renewed hope,” Zimmermann said on Sunday from the meeting in Copenhagen. “We have been waiting for ways to ditch the good old chemotherapy that carries significant toxicity.” Shares of Merck, which have gained 19 percent this year, rose 3 percent in trading before the opening of U.S. markets, while Bristol-Myers fell 6.1 percent, adding to a 19 percent decline this year. AstraZeneca fell 0.4 percent at 12:31 p.m. in London, and Roche rose 0.4 percent in Zurich. Patient Selection The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to decide by Dec. 24 whether Keytruda, already approved for patients whose lung cancer got worse after chemotherapy, can be used as an initial treatment too. Some 224,000 Americans will probably be diagnosed with lung tumors this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Much of the battle for dominance in lung immune-oncology drugs thus far has centered on whether patients need to show high levels of a protein called PD-L1 to benefit. Merck’s trial focused on patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at least half the time. That group could comprise as many as one-quarter of newly-diagnosed lung-cancer patients, said Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Combination Tests By contrast, Bristol-Myers’s competing therapy, Opdivo, failed a test as a sole treatment for lung cancer after the company included patients with lower levels of PD-L1. But details of the trial unveiled at the conference pointed to lackluster results even in a narrower group of patients with high PD-L1 levels. “PD-L1 assessment has to be part of the standard diagnostic workup,” said Corey Langer, director of the thoracic oncology program at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “Patients can’t wait for these results.” Langer led a smaller trial of Merck’s Keytruda also presented in Copenhagen, which combined the drug with chemotherapy and also let in all patients, no matter their PD-L1 levels. The combination was almost twice as successful at shrinking lung cancer tumors than a standard chemotherapy regimen. But with just 123 patients, the trial was too small to say for sure whether the combination is better than immune therapy alone, Langer said. Roche also presented results showing its immune therapy contender, Tecentriq, helped patients whose lung tumors had already progressed. Tecentriq was approved by regulators in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the FDA in second-line lung cancer by the end of next week. Results for newly-diagnosed patients aren’t expected before 2018, however. By then, Fazeli said, investors will be focusing on combination therapies. The first results from two immune therapies used together will probably come next year from AstraZeneca. Bristol-Myers is also working on such a combination, with data due out in 2018. Like Merck, Roche is combining its immune-oncology drug with chemotherapy, aiming for approval in 2018. “Given the data you see here with Keytruda alone, the combinations should by logic and by data seem to do better,” Fazeli said.

Opdivo wasn’t superior to chemotherapy even in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which has been thought to be a predictor of how well the immune-system drugs will work, Bristol-Myers said in results presented Sunday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen. The data came from a detailed analysis of the Checkmate-26 study, whose main results were released in August, causing Bristol-Myers’ stock to slump. The results were in stark contrast to the performance of Merck & Co.’s Keytruda in a similar group of patients. Merck’s entire trial was designed around people with high PD-L1 levels, while Bristol-Myers tried to reach a wider range of patients. Bristol-Myers had already announced in August that Opdivo didn’t help the broader group. Sunday’s results showed the treatment didn’t aid the narrower group either. More Women The results were “below expectations,” wrote John Scotti, an analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. Imbalances in the trial, where more women and more people with high PD-L1 levels got chemotherapy, may have skewed the results, said Nick Botwood, the company’s development lead for lung cancer. “The study was designed to ask a very specific question at the 5 percent expression,” Botwood said during a conference call after the data presentation. “It wasn’t designed to ask a question at 50 percent.” He was referring to a measure of how prominent the PD-L1 biomarkers are in a patient’s cancer -- with 50 percent being considered a high level. Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said Bristol-Myers shouldn’t be written off just yet. “No one believes that Opdivo is dead in first line,” Fazeli said in an e-mail. “It’s a drug that has worked in many settings. It’s just that the trial had so many aspects that apparently worked against it.” Merck and Bristol-Myers have been battling for dominance in the new field of immune-oncology, in which medicines are designed to boost the body’s own defenses against cancer. Both drugmakers’ medicines are already approved for people whose lung cancer got worse after initial treatment. The trials presented Sunday would form the basis for approval or rejection as an initial treatment in lung cancer, a much bigger group of potential patients, and could be good news for Merck. “With the right tactical moves, Merck can turn Keytruda into the broadest offering in lung cancer,” said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Cancer Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced data from an ongoing, investigational Phase 1b study of INLYTA (axitinib) combined with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (A4061079, NCT02133742), a PD-1 inhibitor known as KEYTRUDA and marketed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study was designed to establish dosing and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of INLYTA when combined with pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Preliminary results from a similar, separate study combining INLYTA with avelumab (JAVELIN Renal 100, NCT02493751), an investigational, fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is being co-developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer were also presented. The data suggest evidence of anti-tumor activity for INLYTA in combination with avelumab and were presented during a poster discussion session at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology being held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Based on these Phase 1 results, two independent global Phase 3 trials evaluating these combinations INLYTA plus pembrolizumab and INLYTA plus avelumab each compared with SUTENT (sunitinib) in first-line advanced RCC are now enrolling patients. "Combining immunotherapy agents with currently approved therapies such as INLYTA may provide a meaningful improvement in outcome for patients with renal cancer," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., head of immuno-oncology, early development and translational oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "The results presented today indicate that there is a potential additive or synergistic effect between INLYTA and a checkpoint inhibitor in RCC." Early indicators from the A4061079 study point to strong response rates with the INLYTA/pembrolizumab combination, with 37 patients (71.2%, confidence internal 56.9, 82.9) achieving objective responses (three complete responses and 34 partial responses); 10 patients had stable disease and 5 patients had disease progression. Separately, in the JAVELIN Renal 100 study of INLYTA in combination with avelumab, five out of six patients treated so far had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate 83.3%, 95% confidence interval: 35.9, 99.6) and one patient with tumor shrinkage not meeting partial response criteria had stable disease. INLYTA is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy approved in 63 countries. It was the first treatment to demonstrate superior progression-free survival benefit in a Phase 3 study versus sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in second-line treatment of advanced RCC. About Avelumab Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. By inhibiting PD-L1 interactions, avelumab is thought to enable the activation of T-cells and the adaptive immune system. By retaining a native Fc-region, avelumab is thought to potentially engage the innate immune system and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About INLYTA® (axitinib) INLYTA is an oral therapy that is designed to inhibit tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors). In the U.S., INLYTA is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the EU in adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. INLYTA Important Safety Information Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite use of antihypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis. Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who have a history of these events. Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose. Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require permanent discontinuation of INLYTA. Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment. Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. No formal studies of the effect of INLYTA on wound healing have been conducted. Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed. If signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment. Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt treatment. Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA. Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase INLYTA plasma concentrations and should be avoided. Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and, if possible, avoid moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers. The most common (=20%) adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) were diarrhea (55% vs 53%), hypertension (40% vs 29%), fatigue (39% vs 32%), decreased appetite (34% vs 29%), nausea (32% vs 22%), dysphonia (31% vs 14%), hand-foot syndrome (27% vs 51%), weight decreased (25% vs 21%), vomiting (24% vs 17%), asthenia (21% vs 14%), and constipation (20% vs 20%). The most common (=10%) grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (vs sorafenib) were hypertension (16% vs 11%), diarrhea (11% vs 7%), and fatigue (11% vs 5%). The most common (=20%) lab abnormalities occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) included increased creatinine (55% vs 41%), decreased bicarbonate (44% vs 43%), hypocalcemia (39% vs 59%), decreased hemoglobin (35% vs 52%), decreased lymphocytes (absolute) (33% vs 36%), increased ALP (30% vs 34%), hyperglycemia (28% vs 23%), increased lipase (27% vs 46%), increased amylase (25% vs 33%), increased ALT (22% vs 22%), and increased AST (20% vs 25%).

(NYSE:PFE) today announced data from an ongoing, investigational Phase 1b study of INLYTA® (axitinib) combined with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (A4061079, NCT02133742), a PD-1 inhibitor known as KEYTRUDA® and marketed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study was designed to establish dosing and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of INLYTA when combined with pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Preliminary results from a similar, separate study combining INLYTA with avelumab (JAVELIN Renal 100, NCT02493751), an investigational, fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is being co-developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer were also presented. The data suggest evidence of anti-tumor activity for INLYTA in combination with avelumab and were presented during a poster discussion session at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology being held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Based on these Phase 1 results, two independent global Phase 3 trials evaluating these combinations - INLYTA plus pembrolizumab and INLYTA plus avelumab  each compared with SUTENT® (sunitinib) in first-line advanced RCC are now enrolling patients. "Combining immunotherapy agents with currently approved therapies such as INLYTA may provide a meaningful improvement in outcome for patients with renal cancer, said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., head of immuno-oncology, early development and translational oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "The results presented today indicate that there is a potential additive or synergistic effect between INLYTA and a checkpoint inhibitor in RCC. Early indicators from the A4061079 study point to strong response rates with the INLYTA/pembrolizumab combination, with 37 patients (71.2%, confidence internal 56.9, 82.9) achieving objective responses (three complete responses and 34 partial responses); 10 patients had stable disease and 5 patients had disease progression. Separately, in the JAVELIN Renal 100 study of INLYTA in combination with avelumab, five out of six patients treated so far had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate 83.3%, 95% confidence interval: 35.9, 99.6) and one patient with tumor shrinkage not meeting partial response criteria had stable disease. INLYTA is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy approved in 63 countries. It was the first treatment to demonstrate superior progression-free survival benefit in a Phase 3 study versus sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in second-line treatment of advanced RCC. About Avelumab Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. By inhibiting PD-L1 interactions, avelumab is thought to enable the activation of T-cells and the adaptive immune system. By retaining a native Fc-region, avelumab is thought to potentially engage the innate immune system and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About INLYTA® (axitinib) INLYTA is an oral therapy that is designed to inhibit tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors). In the U.S., INLYTA is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the EU in adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. INLYTA Important Safety Information Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite use of antihypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis. Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who have a history of these events. Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose. Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require permanent discontinuation of INLYTA. Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment. Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 per cent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 per cent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 per cent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.   Share More > Vote   Popular Comments Voted Government Know your Emirates ID privileges and benefits in the UAE 65891 views | 18 February 2016 Transport Dubai businessman buys number plate for Dh33 MILLION 58932 views | 8 October 2016 General Dandiya dancing rocks the night at Navratri celebrations 40236 views | 7 October 2016 Gadgets and Electronics Bag these KILLER deals on last day of GITEX Shopper 27713 views | 7 October 2016 Europe British-Indian stabs wife 124 times over asking for divorce 19348 views | 8 October 2016 Newsmakers Fawad Khan breaks silence on India-Pakistan tensions 16568 views | 7 October 2016 Crime Father refuses to accept 'arrogant teenage girl' 9611 views | 8 October 2016 General Arab woman killed in Dubai accident 8476 views | 8 October 2016 Pakistan Pakistan spy agency chief likely to be replaced: Report 5235 views | 8 October 2016 Education Homework in UAE schools: To ban or not to ban? 4536 views | 8 October 2016 Video | Nation Why people jump Dubai red lights Economy Dubai's non-oil foreign trade at Dh647 billion in H1 2016 0 comments | 8 October 2016 Technology Gitex shoppers pleased with deals 0 comments | 4 October 2016 Football Guardiola says he owes his success to Cruyff 0 comments | 6 October 2016 Abu Dhabi Let the hunting games begin: Adihex 2016 is now open 0 comments | 4 October 2016 Africa Anti-apartheid icon Tutu wants choice of assisted death 0 comments | 7 October 2016 General 9-year-old Emirati girl drowns in RAK 0 comments | 8 October 2016 Rest of Asia Suicide bombings kill at least eight in Baghdad: Officials 0 comments | 3 October 2016 UAE health Sleep well or risk getting cancer 0 comments | 2 October 2016 Music Rolling Stones to release new album in December 0 comments | 6 October 2016 General Dubai ranked among world's TOP 5 shopping cities 9 votes | 8 October 2016 Cricket England beat Bangladesh despite Kayes and Shakib heroics 9 votes | 7 October 2016 Americas Hurricane kills 339, Obama declares emergency 9 votes | 7 October 2016 India India says it foils attack on Kashmir base, kills three militants 9 votes | 6 October 2016 Video | Business Emirates NBD launches futuristic banking...

Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Highlights: *Keytruda cuts risk of death 40 pc in big lung cancer study *Drug also improves outcomes when given with chemotherapy *Immunotherapy changing standard of care in cancer Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.

Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

These data were also published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Based upon the results observed from KEYNOTE-024, to date KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 to demonstrate superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and do not express EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations. In KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, which included patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression level, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin plus pemetrexed) achieved a 55 percent objective response rate (ORR) compared to 29 percent for chemotherapy alone, the standard of care, and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent. To date, KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate superior efficacy in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients receiving first-line treatment. These data were published today in The Lancet Oncology. “Chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for decades, but survival rates remain low,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Our new data suggest that KEYTRUDA treatment can offer meaningful improvement over chemotherapy in a broad array of patients. In this sense, these studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer. We sincerely thank the patients and the clinical investigators for their participation in our studies. Together we are working to improve the health of more and more patients with cancer.” Merck has submitted KEYNOTE-024 data to regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review, with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Dec. 24, 2016. Merck is currently advancing multiple registration-enabling studies in NSCLC with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination, including the combination of KEYTRUDA plus a platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated, non-squamous NSCLC in the ongoing phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 350 clinical trials across more than 30 tumor types, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. KEYNOTE-024: Data Showed KEYTRUDA was Superior to Chemotherapy for PFS and OS in First-Line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC KEYNOTE-024 included 305 patients who were previously untreated and whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more). Patients were randomized to receive a 200 mg fixed dose of KEYTRUDA every three weeks (n=154) or four to six cycles of investigator’s choice of one of five platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (n=151): carboplatin or cisplatin plus pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin plus gemcitabine, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Pemetrexed maintenance therapy was permitted for patients with non-squamous histologies. Patients randomized to the control arm had the option of crossing over to KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) upon disease progression. The median follow-up was 11.2 months (range, 6.3-19.7). The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints were OS, ORR, and safety. The findings published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.37-0.68]; p<0.001). The median PFS for KEYTRUDA was 10.3 months (95% CI, 6.7-not reached) compared to 6.0 months for chemotherapy (95% CI, 4.2-6.2). At six months, 62.1 percent of patients treated with KEYTRUDA were alive and had no disease progression (95% CI, 53.8-69.4) compared to 50.3 percent of those receiving chemotherapy (95% CI, 41.9-58.2). This benefit was observed in all study subgroups. Additionally, KEYTRUDA resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared with chemotherapy (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41-0.89]; p=0.005); this finding includes the 66 patients (43.7%) on the chemotherapy arm who crossed over in-study to receive KEYTRUDA once their cancer had progressed; median OS was not reached in either group. Further, ORR was 44.8 percent for patients receiving KEYTRUDA (95% CI, 36.8-53.0), including six complete responses, compared to 27.8 percent with chemotherapy (95% CI, 20.8-35.7), including one complete response. “These data from KEYNOTE-024 demonstrate the potential of KEYTRUDA to change the way non-small cell lung cancer is currently treated,” said Dr. Martin Reck, head of the thoracic oncology dept., LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and lead author of TheNew England Journal of Medicine paper. “This provides additional evidence that testing for PD-L1 levels should become standard in lung cancer at first diagnosis to guide treatment decisions.” Additional Findings and Safety Information from KEYNOTE-024 The safety of KEYTRUDA was consistent with what has been seen in previous trials among patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common treatment-related adverse events for KEYTRUDA were diarrhea (n=22), fatigue (n=16), and pyrexia (n=16). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events for KEYTRUDA included diarrhea (n=6) and pneumonitis (n=4). There was one treatment-related death in a patient receiving KEYTRUDA (cause unknown). Additionally, based on an analysis of duration of response, a pre-specified exploratory endpoint, the median duration of response was not reached with KEYTRUDA (range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months). The median duration of response with the chemotherapy group was 6.3 months (range, 2.1+ to 12.6+). Median time to response was 2.2 months for both groups. About KEYNOTE-024 KEYNOTE-024 is a randomized, phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02142738) evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as monotherapy compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Patients enrolled were those who had received no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for their advanced disease, whose tumors did not harbor an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK translocation, and whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more) as determined by a central laboratory using an FDA approved companion diagnostic, the Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx test, from Agilent Technologies. KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G: KEYTRUDA Combined with Chemotherapy Showed Higher Response Rates Compared to Chemotherapy Alone as First-Line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, included 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and whose tumors did not have EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. Patients were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA plus platinum doublet chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin (n=60) or platinum doublet chemotherapy alone (n=63). Patients randomized to the chemotherapy-only arm had the option of crossing over to KEYTRUDA monotherapy upon disease progression. The median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 0.8-19.3). The findings published in The Lancet Oncology demonstrated that ORR nearly doubled by adding KEYTRUDA to chemotherapy, with an ORR of 55 percent (n=33/60) compared to 29 percent (n=18/63) for chemotherapy alone (treatment difference 26%, 95% CI, 9-42%, p=0.0016); all responses were partial. Median duration of response was not reached in either group (range, 1.4+-13.0+ for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy; 1.4+-15.2+ for chemotherapy alone). Responses in both groups were durable, with 88 percent (n=29/33) of responders in the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy group and 78 percent (n=14/18) of responders in the chemotherapy alone group experiencing ongoing response at the time of data cut-off. Additionally, the KEYTRUDA combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI, 0.31-0.91, p=0.0102). Median PFS was 13.0 months with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy compared to 8.9 months with chemotherapy alone. OS was similar between the two arms, with 92 percent survival at six months in both, and 75 percent and 72 percent survival at 12 months in the KEYTRUDA combination and chemotherapy alone, respectively. Of treated patients on the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy arm, 47 percent remained on treatment as of the cut-off date, compared to 31 percent on chemotherapy alone. Of the treated patients who discontinued treatment on the chemotherapy-only arm, 52 percent (n=32/62) subsequently received anti-PD-L1 therapy, with 32 percent crossing over to KEYTRUDA monotherapy as allowed by the study protocol and 19 percent receiving it outside of study crossover. “The results from KEYNOTE-021 show that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy nearly doubled the number of patients responding to treatment than chemotherapy alone,” said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology and professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and lead author of The Lancet Oncology paper. “We are now gaining a better understanding that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy may play an important role in the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.” Additional Safety Information from KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G The most common treatment-related adverse events (occurring in at least 15% of patients) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy were fatigue, nausea, anemia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, increased AST, constipation, decreased appetite, increased ALT, dysgeusia, and decreased neutrophils. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in this arm included fatigue, nausea, anemia, rash, vomiting, increased AST, increased ALT, and decreased neutrophils. The most common immune-mediated adverse events in patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy were hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Additionally, pneumonitis, infusion reactions, and severe skin toxicity were noted.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (44%), cough (29%), decreased appetite (25%), and dyspnea (23%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

These data, from the phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-010 trial, will be presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, in Copenhagen(Abstract #LBA48). “These findings – which show superior survival with longer follow-up across patients with PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of one percent or more), as well as improved quality of life – point to KEYTRUDA as a durable treatment option for many previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,” said Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. “These data also reinforce the value of using PD-L1 as a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA.” In additional data at the ESMO 2016 Congress from KEYNOTE-010, an analysis of patient-reported health-related quality of lifeoutcomes showed more patients treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) reported positive outcomes compared to patients treated with chemotherapy (Abstract #1219P). Separately at the ESMO 2016 Congress, researchers presented an analysis of PD-L1 prevalence across three separate studies, including KEYNOTE-010. Overall, 66 percent of patients with metastatic NSCLC expressed any level of PD-L1, and 28 percent expressed high levels of PD-L1 (Abstract #1060P). “Our research in immuno-oncology continues to show tremendous promise, with our goal being to extend the lives of significant numbers of patients with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “In this longer-term analysis of KEYNOTE-010, among patients who responded to treatment, four times as many patients receiving KEYTRUDA were still alive without disease progression compared to docetaxel. It is gratifying to see these results continue with additional follow-up.” Merck has a robust clinical development program for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, with multiple registration-enabling studies currently underway. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical trials, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Efficacy and Safety Findings from KEYNOTE-010 (Abstract #LBA48) KEYNOTE-010 is a global, open-label, randomized, pivotal phase 2/3 study evaluating KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every three weeks) compared to standard of care chemotherapy (docetaxel, 75 mg/m [2]  every three weeks) in patients with previously treated metastatic NSCLC. The primary endpoints were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) and were assessed based on patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS of one percent or more) and high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response. KEYNOTE-010 is the first study of its kind to evaluate the potential of an immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy based on prospective measurement of PD-L1 expression in patients with metastatic NSCLC. As previously announced, the study met its primary objective, showing that KEYTRUDA significantly improved OS compared to chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more). Findings were similar in patients who received the FDA-approved dose of KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg every three weeks) and an investigational dose of KEYTRUDA (10 mg/kg every three weeks). These data also served as the basis for the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) application approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July of this year and are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the second-line or greater NSCLC treatment setting. At the ESMO 2016 Congress, data from this study of 1,034 patients included six months of additional follow-up, with a median follow-up of 19.2 months (range, 11.7-29.7), and showed superior outcomes of OS, PFS, and ORR with KEYTRUDA compared to docetaxel in patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more) as well as high levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more) – with consistency of outcomes across KEYTRUDA doses. In patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more), OS at 18 months was 37 percent (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.87]; p=0.0003) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 43 percent (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.73]; p<0.00001) with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and 24 percent with docetaxel. Among all patients, median OS was 10.5 months with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 13.6 months with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and 8.6 months with docetaxel. ORR was 19 percent (95% CI, 15-23, p=0.00025) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 20 percent (95% CI, 16-25, p=0.00004) with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg and 10 percent (95% CI, 7-13) with docetaxel. Responses to KEYTRUDA continued to be durable; among patients with any level of PD-L1 expression who responded to treatment, 60 percent on each of the KEYTRUDA treatment arms were alive, progression-free, and had not received additional therapy for their disease, compared to 15 percent in the docetaxel treatment arm. In patients with hnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 550 patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (44%), cough (29%), decreased appetite (25%), and dyspnea (23%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. In contrast to rival Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose Opdivo drug failed to help such first-line patients, Keytruda was targeted at people who express high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress. The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, viewed as the largest market. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy. Results of Merck's two trials were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet Oncology journal.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Oct 10, 2016 at 6:42PM The stock market performed well on Monday, with the Dow climbing 88 points and other major market benchmarks posting similar gains of roughly half a percent. Many investors were pleased with the continued advances in the crude oil market, where prices approached the $52-per-barrel level on news of potential supply constraints because of Russian production controls and measures from OPEC member nations. Yet even though the stock market rose and sent the Energy Select SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLE) up more than 1.5%, some stocks nevertheless lost substantial ground. Among the worst perfomers were Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN), and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. Bristol faces a competitive setback Bristol-Myers Squibb lost more than 10% after a tough weekend for the drug-maker. On one hand, the company's presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology showed few signs of any positive signs for its Checkmate-026 trial of its Opdivo candidate treatment for a form of lung cancer. At the same time, competitor Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced much more encouraging trial data for its Keytruda lung-cancer drug, setting the stage for a competitive showdown in which the odds will be very much in Merck's favor. If Merck gets the upper hand, then it will be extremely difficult for Bristol's Opdivo to meet the expectations that its shareholders have for the drug, and that could put even further pressure on the drug-maker's shares going forward. Analysts hit Myriad shares Myriad Genetics dropped 12% in the wake of an analyst's downgrade of the genetic testing company's stock. Analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann downgraded shares of Myriad Genetics from neutral to sell. The current target price of $16 per share for the stock would imply even further downside from current levels, and investors are increasingly worried about potential competition. For instance, Myriad currently relies heavily on its BRACAnalysis test for breast and ovarian cancer, but some potential competitors believe that they can offer reduced pricing that could hurt Myriad's business model in the long run. The question is how long Myriad can ride its first-mover advantage, but the prospect of an end to its competitive moat is making some Myriad Genetics shareholders take a hard look at their shares today. Twilio's early investors sell out Finally, Twilio plunged 14%. The company said late Friday that it would register a follow-on public offering of stock, allowing several of its existing stockholders to liquidate all or part of their holdings in the company. Twilio expects to issue $50 million in new stock in the offering, with the proceeds going to the company. However, the remaining $350 million in offered shares would represent holdings of third-party shareholders, and Twilio won't see any of those proceeds. The move comes as somewhat of a surprise because lock-up provisions for the newly public company weren't set to expire until late December. Given the success that the smartphone messaging and video specialist's stock has seen, it's no surprise that institutional investors want to book profits, and for long-term investors who believe in the company's prospects down the road, the drop could represent a good opportunity for more investment.

(AP / Shuji Kajiyama) Marley Jay, The Associated Press Published Monday, October 10, 2016 1:38AM EDT Last Updated Monday, October 10, 2016 12:47PM EDT NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks are rising Monday as energy companies rise in tandem with the price of oil, which is trading at a three-month high. Apple is climbing after new reports of fires affecting Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone, which competes with Apple's iPhone. That's sending technology stocks higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 97 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,337 as of 12:40 p.m. Eastern time. The index rose as much as 159 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,164. The Nasdaq composite added 41 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,333. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.33, or 2.7 per cent, to $51.14 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.13, or 2.2 per cent, to $53.06 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil climbed $1.56, or 1.8 per cent, to $88.30 and Murphy Oil added 64 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $30.16. SHOT IN THE ARM: Drugmaker Mylan gained $3.11, or 8.7 per cent, to $39.05. On Friday the company agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations it overcharged the Medicaid program for its EpiPen allergy shot. Legislators and federal health authorities had said Mylan wrongly classified EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a brand-name one, which meant Mylan paid lower rebates to federal and state Medicaid programs. The stock is down 20 per cent since late August. BRISTOL BUMPED: Bristol-Myers Squibb lost $5.55, or 10 per cent, to $49.89 after the company reported new data from a study of its drug Opdivo in lung cancer patients. Rival Merck rose $1.13, or 1.8 per cent, to $63.91 as investors were pleased with the outcome of a study of its cancer treatment Keytruda. Bristol-Myers stock has dropped 34 per cent since the company announced initial results from that trial in early August while Merck has gained 10 per cent. TWITTER BLOCKED: Social media network Twitter continued to fall as investors grew less optimistic that the company will be sold. Twitter sank $2.67, or 13.5 per cent, to $17.18. It fell 20 per cent Thursday on reports that possible buyers including Apple and Alphabet had decided not to make offers. Salesforce.com, which investors believe is a possible buyer, rose $4.25, or 6 per cent, to $75.16. SAMSUNG'S PAIN, APPLE'S GAIN: Apple climbed $2.24, or 2 per cent, to $116.30 as investors hope it will be able to sell more iPhones as competitor Samsung faced new problems with its Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said it has changed its production of the phones following reports that some of its replacement phones are overheating and catching fire, just as the original version of the phone did before Samsung recalled it last month. Samsung did not confirm or deny a report from a Korean news agency that it suspended production of the Note 7 phone. PESOS AND PRESIDENTS: The Mexican peso surged to 18.8815 from 19.2961 following a calamitous weekend for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump has criticized Mexico and its trade agreements with the U.S., so the peso has become something of an indicator of how investors feel about the election. The currency has tended to weak when investors feel Trump is doing better and gets stronger when investors feel more confident in Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's chances. The U.S. buys about 80 per cent of Mexico's exports, which gives it a big influence on the Mexican economy. The peso has fallen sharply this year but is currently the strongest it's been in about a month. DOVER DIVES: Manufacturer Dover forecast a smaller profit and a bigger decline in revenue because of weaker spending in several industries and production problems in its retail refrigeration unit. The company also said its purchase of British company Wayne Fueling Systems won't close until early next year because regulators in the United Kingdom are still reviewing the deal. The stock gave up $4.93, or 6.8 per cent, to $67.31. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 1.3 per cent and the CAC-40 in France was 1.1 per cent higher. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.8 per cent. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.1 per cent. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. CURRENCY: The dollar rose to 103.66 yen from 103.06 yen Friday. The euro fell to $1.1152 from $1.1182, and the British pound fell to $1.2383 from $1.2435. Bond trading was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 percent to 17,046.16. Tokyo markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.9 percent to 2,039.04. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added nearly 0.2 percent to 5,484.60. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat at 23,849.01, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.3 percent to 3,057.02. Shares in Southeast Asia were mixed. SAMSUNG WOES: Shares in Samsung Electronics fell 5.4 percent after the company said it was sales of its Note 7 smartphones. It advised customers to turn off their devices or replace them. Samsung issued a worldwide recall of the Note 7, a huge phone-bordering-on-tablet with a powerful battery, in late September after the devices were found to have a tendency to catch fire. South Korean officials said Tuesday that replacement devices have also overheated or caught fire. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 88.55 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,329.04. The index rose as much as 159 points earlier. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 9.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,163.66. The Nasdaq composite added 36.27 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,328.67. OIL AND RUSSIA: Oil prices fell slightly after spiking to their highest level in a year after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Russia, which is not a member of OPEC, supports a preliminary agreement by OPEC nations to cut oil output. THE QUOTE: “It was Russia to the rescue last night, as Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to join with OPEC in creating a deal to curb production and pump up prices. At the same Energy Congress in Istanbul, the ever outspoken Algerian Energy Minister called on other non-OPEC producers to join them,” Jeff Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a commentary. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 11 cents to $51.24. It added $1.54 to $51.35 a barrel in New York on Monday, its highest closing price since July 2015. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 7 cents to $53.07 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.94 yen from 102.96 yen late Monday in Asia. The euro fell to $ 1.1128 from $1.1192.

The U.S. drugmaker’s Keytruda medicine reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 percent, Merck said, unveiling details of a crucial study at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. The medicine gave patients an average of 10.3 months before their cancer progressed, compared with six months on chemotherapy. Unlike competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose similar drug Opdivo failed in an advanced trial and caused its stock to plunge, Merck selected patients who harbored high levels of a protein thought to predict how well the immune-system drugs will work. The results give Merck a head start — and not just on Bristol-Myers. Roche Holding and AstraZeneca are also in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors, the most common cancer in the world. While Merck and Bristol-Myers are the leaders, each of the four companies will probably be able to take a piece of the market as data emerges from single and combination therapies for patients with various levels of the predictive protein, said Mirjam Heeb, who helps manage $186 million in health care stocks, including Bristol-Myers, Roche and Merck, at GAM Holding in Zurich. Story continues below advertisement. “We can assume now that Merck has a lead of at least 12 months” in its target patient group, Heeb said in a telephone interview. “But the overall landscape is changing so fast that I think it’s impossible to predict what it will look like in 12 months.” Doctors will probably start testing patients soon after diagnosis to see whether they’re suited to treatment with Keytruda and can forgo the many side effects of chemotherapy, said Stefan Zimmermann, a chief oncologist at the Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg, Switzerland. “The main reaction will actually be relief and renewed hope,” Zimmermann said Sunday from the meeting in Copenhagen. “We have been waiting for ways to ditch the good old chemotherapy that carries significant toxicity.” The Food and Drug Administration is set to decide by Dec. 24 whether Keytruda, already approved for patients whose lung cancer got worse after chemotherapy, can be used as an initial treatment too. Some 224,000 Americans will probably be diagnosed with lung tumors this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Much of the battle for dominance in lung immune-oncology drugs thus far has centered on whether patients need to show high levels of a protein called PD-L1 to benefit. Merck’s trial focused on patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at least half the time. That group could comprise as many as one-quarter of newly-diagnosed lung-cancer patients, said Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. By contrast, Bristol-Myers’s competing therapy, Opdivo, failed a test as a sole treatment for lung cancer after the company included patients with lower levels of PD-L1. But details of the trial unveiled at the conference pointed to lackluster results even in a narrower group of patients with high PD-L1 levels. “PD-L1 assessment has to be part of the standard diagnostic workup,” said Corey Langer, director of the thoracic oncology program at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “Patients can’t wait for these results.” Shares of Merck have gained 19 percent this year, while Bristol has declined 19 percent. AstraZeneca has risen about 10 percent, and Roche has lost 13 percent. Langer led a smaller trial of Merck’s Keytruda also presented in Copenhagen, which combined the drug with chemotherapy and also let in all patients, no matter their PD-L1 levels. The combination was almost twice as successful at shrinking lung cancer tumors than a standard chemotherapy regimen. But with just 123 patients, the trial was too small to say for sure whether the combination is better than immune therapy alone, Langer said. Roche also presented results showing its immune therapy contender, Tecentriq, helped patients whose lung tumors had already progressed. Tecentriq was approved by regulators in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the FDA in second-line lung cancer by the end of next week. Results for newly diagnosed patients aren’t expected before 2018, however. By then, Fazeli said, investors will be focusing on combination therapies. The first results from two immune therapies used together will probably come next year from AstraZeneca. Bristol-Myers is also working on such a combination, with data due out in 2018. Like Merck, Roche is combining its immune-oncology drug with chemotherapy, aiming for approval in 2018. “Given the data you see here with Keytruda alone, the combinations should by logic and by data seem to do better,” Fazeli said. Jared S. Hopkins and Ketaki Gokhale contributed.   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« A new study says birth control pills may make you depressed, but that’s not news to many women Next story:United by pot, divided by policy: How Maine’s pro-marijuana forces disagree » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Case of rare, infectious brain illness confirmed at Maine Med Speed, alcohol cited as factors in crash that killed 2 on Golden Road The Mars Hill bank robbery that shocked Maine 45 years ago Defying trend, Northeast Harbor on MDI says no to cruise ships Twin Rivers to acquire paper mills in New York, Mississippi Five things that explain Donald Trump’s stunning presidential election victory It’s too easy to get a referendum question on the ballot.

CALIFORNIA Anti-Trump protesters take to L.A.'s streets for a fifth day BUSINESS U.S. stocks close up, lifted by oil prices and Apple Wall Street sign Mark Lennihan / Associated Press U.S. flags fly at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. U.S. flags fly at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) Associated Press U.S. stocks rose Monday as crude oil jumped to its highest price in more than a year and energy companies climbed with it. Investors also reacted to the latest twists in the presidential race. Apple reached its highest price of the year and led tech stocks higher after new reports of fires affecting Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone, which competes with Apple's iPhone. Steve Chiavarone, an associated portfolio manager for Federated Investors, said a tumultuous weekend for Republican candidate Donald Trump contributed to the market's gains. He said investors mostly expect Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win, and that they are concerned about the effect Trump's trade proposals would have on the market and the economy. “What you're seeing in the market is a cheering of the status quo,” he said. In his view, that's because investors understand Clinton's views and what her administration might look like even though they may disagree with her on issues such as tax policy. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88.55 points, or 0.4%, to 18,329.04. The index had been up as much as 159 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 9.92 points, or 0.5%, to 2,163.66. The Nasdaq composite advanced 36.27 points, or 0.7%, to 5,328.67. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Russia supports OPEC's efforts to cut oil production. In late September the nations of OPEC announced a preliminary agreement to trim oil production, but Russia, a major energy producer, is not a member of OPEC. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 3.1% to $51.35 a barrel. That was its highest closing price since July 2015. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 2.3% to $53.14 a barrel. Exxon Mobil shares climbed 2% to $88.44 and Devon Energy shares jumped 3.7% to $44.39. Apple climbed 1.7% to $116.05 on investors’ hopes that the company will be able to sell more iPhones as competitor Samsung faces new problems with its Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said it has changed its production of the phones following reports that some of its replacement phones are overheating and catching fire, just as the original version of the phone did before Samsung recalled it last month. Samsung did not confirm or deny a report from a Korean news agency that it suspended production of the Note 7 phone. Twitter continued to fall, sinking 11.5% to $17.56, as investors grew less optimistic that the company will be sold.  Read more: Twitter's stock slumps again as buyout interest reportedly cools » Mylan jumped 8.2% to $38.87. On Friday the drugmaker agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations it overcharged the Medicaid program for its EpiPen allergy shot. Legislators and federal health authorities had said Mylan wrongly classified EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a brand-name one, which meant Mylan paid lower rebates to federal and state Medicaid programs. The stock is down 20% since late August. Bristol-Myers Squibb plunged again, falling 10.1% to $49.81, after the company reported more data from a study of its drug Opdivo in lung cancer patients. Rival Merck rose 1.8% to $63.90 as investors were pleased with results from a study of its cancer treatment Keytruda. Bristol-Myers stock has dropped 34% since the company announced initial results from its Opdivo trial in early August, sending the price to almost two-year lows. Merck is up 10% over the same time. The Mexican peso grew stronger after Trump's calamitous weekend. Trump has criticized Mexico and its trade agreements with the United States, so the peso has become something of an indicator of how investors feel about the election. The currency has tended to weaken when investors feel Trump is doing better and gets stronger when investors feel more confident in Clinton's chances. The United States buys about 80% of Mexico's exports, giving it a big influence on the Mexican economy. After the peso's surge Monday, one U.S. dollar bought just 18.92 pesos, versus the 19.26 pesos it bought Friday. The peso has weakened sharply this year but is currently the strongest it's been in about a month. Manufacturer Dover fell 7.7% to $66.69 after it forecast a smaller profit and a bigger decline in revenue because of weaker spending in several industries and production problems in its retail refrigeration unit. The company also said its purchase of British company Wayne Fueling Systems won't close until early next year because regulators in Britain are still reviewing the deal. Gold rose $8.50 to $1,260.40 an ounce. Silver added 28 cents to $17.66 an ounce. Copper picked up 3 cents to $2.20 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas gained 8 cents, or 2.6%, to $3.28 per 1,000 cubic feet. Germany's DAX rose 1.3% and the CAC-40 in France was 1.1% higher. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.1%. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. The dollar rose to 103.68 yen from 103.06 yen Friday. The euro fell to $1.1139 from $1.1182, and the British pound fell to $1.2351 from $1.2435. Bond trading was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.  Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

português suomeksi svenska In its First Decade, Rotavirus Vaccination Has Saved Thousands of Children --CHOP and Wistar Vaccine Inventors Mark a Milestone in Global Public Health-- News provided by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Oct 10, 2016, 11:00 ET Share this article PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Vaccines are one of the paramount public health successes of the 20th century, and this new century has added another milestone to that history: vaccinations that block rotavirus, a major worldwide killer of children under five. Two Philadelphia research institutions are marking the 10th anniversary of a vaccine against rotavirus, a widespread microbe that infects the gastrointestinal system, causing severe, life-threatening diarrhea and vomiting. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and The Wistar Institute carried out the early research, beginning in the 1980s, that culminated in the Rotateq® vaccine being approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in 2006. It was added to the list of routine childhood vaccinations that same year. Together with Rotarix®, another rotavirus vaccine approved in 2008, vaccination efforts have profoundly reduced death and suffering from rotavirus infections in the U.S. and worldwide. Continue Reading Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center at CHOP, fellow Rotateq(R) inventor Stanley Plotkin, MD, and Penny M. Heaton, MD, director of Vaccine Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, joined leaders from Wistar and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on a panel at an October 6 event held at The Wistar Institute: "Celebrating 10 Years of Rotavirus Prevention." "Before rotavirus vaccination, roughly half a million children would go to U.S. emergency rooms every year from this infection," said Paul Offit, MD, director of the Vaccine Education Center at CHOP, and one of the three co-inventors of Rotateq®. "Of that number, 75,000 children would be hospitalized with severe dehydration, and 20 to 60 would die. Today, child hospitalizations from rotavirus have dropped by 85 percent in this country." Worldwide, progress has occurred, but much remains to be done. "Rotavirus kills almost 2,000 children each day throughout the world, but as the vaccines get into low-income parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America, they will save hundreds of children's lives per day," said Offit. Offit, fellow Rotateq® inventor Stanley Plotkin, MD, and Penny M. Heaton, MD, director of Vaccine Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, joined leaders from Wistar and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on a panel at an October 6 event held at The Wistar Institute: "Celebrating 10 Years of Rotavirus Prevention.*" "This event is a great opportunity to celebrate the development, implementation and impact of the Rotateq® vaccine, but most importantly to tell the story of the scientists involved, the hurdles and successes of the work and the incredible impact that was made across the globe," said Dario C. Altieri, MD, president and CEO of The Wistar Institute and director of Wistar's Cancer Center. Offit and Plotkin, along with H Fred Clark, DVM, PhD, were the scientific trio who performed early research on rotavirus between 1980 and 1991 at both CHOP and Wistar. Plotkin was a veteran vaccine researcher, having already invented the vaccine for rubella (German measles). Clark, a veterinarian, understood how rotavirus infected all mammals, and isolated a bovine strain of rotavirus that served as a foundation for the new vaccine. And Offit, fresh from his pediatric residency, drew on his training in immunology and virology to help design the optimal combination of components to prevent rotavirus's worst effects. For those efforts, the three scientists shared CHOP's highest honor, its Gold Medal, in 2006. Clark died in 2012. Building on this initial research, Merck & Co., Inc. tested the Rotateq® vaccine between 1990 and 2006 in a series of studies spanning 11 countries and involving 72,000 subjects. "From research to development to implementation, each phase becomes successively more difficult—and expensive," said Offit. At the time, Heaton was Merck's senior director for vaccine clinical research and chaired the development team for the Rotateq® vaccine. She was instrumental in the advancement of Rotateq®, which went on to be licensed in numerous countries across the world and recommended by leading health organizations for all infants worldwide. Because many developing countries cannot afford to buy and administer vaccines, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where Heaton now directs vaccine development, is supporting a global campaign to bring rotavirus vaccination to areas that need it most. "As the scientific community continues to make important contributions to the fields of virology and vaccinology, we look to the visionaries, whose groundbreaking discoveries have led to the creation of innovative vaccines that can halt the spread of disease and improve public health worldwide," said Altieri. "The Rotateq® vaccine is one of those major achievements that has a significant and positive global impact, saving countless lives and promoting healthy futures for the citizens of the world." About The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was founded in 1855 as the nation's first pediatric hospital. Through its long-standing commitment to providing exceptional patient care, training new generations of pediatric healthcare professionals, and pioneering major research initiatives, Children's Hospital has fostered many discoveries that have benefited children worldwide.  Its pediatric research program is among the largest in the country.  In addition, its unique family-centered care and public service programs have brought the 535-bed hospital recognition as a leading advocate for children and adolescents.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks jump as energy companies and Apple move higher Monday Oct 10, 2016 at 11:19 AM Oct 10, 2016 at 11:19 AM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are climbing in Monday trading as energy companies rise in tandem with the price of oil. Materials companies are also moving up. Apple is rising after new reports of fires affecting Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone, which competes with Apple's iPhone. That's sending technology stocks higher.  KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 148 points, or 0.8 percent, to 18,388 as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 15 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,168. The Nasdaq composite added 48 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,340. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.52, or 3.1 percent, to $51.33 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.46, or 2.8 percent, to $53.39 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil climbed $1.83, or 2.1 percent, to $88.57 and Murphy Oil added 91 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $30.42. SHOT IN THE ARM: Drugmaker Mylan gained $2.92, or 8.1 percent, to $38.86. On Friday the company agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations it overcharged the Medicaid program for its EpiPen allergy shot. Legislators and federal health authorities had said Mylan wrongly classified EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a brand-name one, which meant Mylan paid lower rebates to federal and state Medicaid programs. The stock is down 20 percent since late August. BRISTOL BUMPED: Bristol-Myers Squibb lost $5.43, or 9.8 percent, to $50 after the company reported new data from a study of its drug Opdivo in lung cancer patients. Rival Merck rose $1.43, or 2.3 percent, to $64.20 as investors were pleased with the outcome of a study of its cancer treatment Keytruda. Bristol-Myers stock has dropped 34 percent since the company announced initial results from that trial in early August while Merck has gained 11 percent. TWITTER BLOCKED: Social media network Twitter continued to fall as investors grew less optimistic that the company will be sold. Twitter sank $2.79, or 14.1 percent, to $17.06. It fell 20 percent Thursday on reports that possible buyers including Apple and Alphabet had decided not to make offers. SAMSUNG'S PAIN, APPLE'S GAIN: Apple climbed $2.22, or 1.9 percent, to $116.28 as investors hope it will be able to sell more iPhones as competitor Samsung faced new problems with its Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said it has changed its production of the phones following reports that some of its replacement phones are overheating and catching fire, just as the original version of the phone did before Samsung recalled it last month. Samsung did not confirm or deny a report from a Korean news agency that it suspended production of the Note 7 phone. MATERIALS MOVE: Chemicals companies traded higher. LyondellBassell Industries gained $1.43, or 1.8 percent, to $82.87. Dow Chemical picked up 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $53.80 and DuPont, which plans to combine with Dow, rose $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $53.80. PESOS AND PRESIDENTS: The Mexican peso surged to 18.8383 from 19.2961 following a calamitous weekend for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump has criticized Mexico and its trade agreements with the U.S., so the peso has become something of an indicator of how investors feel about the election. The currency has tended to weak when investors feel Trump is doing better and gets stronger when investors feel more confident in Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's chances. The U.S. buys about 80 percent of Mexico's exports, which gives it a big influence on the Mexican economy. The peso has fallen sharply this year but is currently the strongest it's been in about a month. DOVER DIVES: Manufacturer Dover forecast a smaller profit and a bigger decline in revenue because of weaker spending in several industries and production problems in its retail refrigeration unit. The company also said its purchase of British company Wayne Fueling Systems won't close until early next year because regulators in the United Kingdom are still reviewing the deal. The stock gave up $4.26, or 5.9 percent, to $67.98. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX rose 1.3 percent and the CAC-40 in France was 1.1 percent higher. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.8 percent. Seoul's Kospi rose 0.1 percent. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. CURRENCY: The dollar rose to 103.53 yen from 103.06 yen Friday. The euro fell to $1.1164 from $1.1182, and the British pound fell to $1.2378 from $1.2435. Bond trading was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.

The Election Can't Come Soon Enough For Biotechs Bristol-Myers cancer drug combo shows promise (Seeking Alpha) Related MRK Technical Alert - Merck Lower 2 Big Medical Marijuana Stocks Riding High Post-Election The Best Dividend Stocks In The Healthcare Sector After The Election (Seeking Alpha) Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) shares are pushing higher by 1.9 percent on Monday following the company’s encouraging new data on Keytruda. On Sunday, Merck reported that Keytruda reduced patient deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone and cut disease progression in half. While that data is great news for Merck shareholders, it’s a blow to competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY), which is down 8.7 percent in early Monday trading. Bristol-Myers released the full data on disappointing cancer drug Opdivo over the weekend, and the results were even worse than investors had feared. Opdivo has yet to demonstrate that it can slow tumor growth or save lives better than current chemotherapy methods. Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham sees a clear winner between the two drugs. According to Meacham, Merck could be looking at a potential Keytruda market of up to 60 percent of eligible IL lung patients. “We see the Keytruda data driving an upward bias to consensus forecasts and further upside in MRK shares while the surprises in CM-026 and uncertain timelines for the next front line data readouts are likely to dash the Bristol hope trade coming into this meeting,” Meacham explains.

Roche’s own “aggressive approach” to experimenting with chemotherapy combinations was bolstered by Merck’s results in studying the impact of using its Keytruda medicine with the older treatment regimen, Dan Chen, the Swiss drugmaker’s global head of cancer immunotherapy, said in an interview on Monday. Merck’s combination was almost twice as successful at shrinking lung tumors in a mid-stage study than the standard treatment alone. “We are not throwing spaghetti on a wall,” said Chen, speaking from the European Society for Medical Oncology’s annual meeting in Copenhagen. “We’re throwing darts, and with each dart trying to answer an important question.” Both Merck and Roche are running larger final-stage studies, with results due starting next year, that could be used to seek approval to start selling a chemo-immunotherapy combination. One possibility is that chemotherapy combinations will be used mostly in patients shown to benefit less from stand-alone immune therapy, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts said in a note. Chemotherapy combinations will also probably cost health systems less than pairing two immune therapy drugs. “If the data is comparable, also on durability, it’s going to be the cheaper option,” said Mirjam Heeb, who helps manage $186 million in health-care stocks, including Roche and Merck, at GAM Holding AG in Zurich. “Looking at the discussion we have around drug pricing, it is going to be competitive.” Roche is also testing more than 20 combinations of immune therapies. The company reported successful stand-alone results from its Tecentriq medicine on Saturday in lung-cancer patients who had already tried at least one other drug unsuccessfully.

REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky  (Copyright Reuters 2015) Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. More on this... Air pollution tied to shorter survival with lung cancer Bristol-Myers' Opdivo fails lung cancer trial; shares plunge Family doctors don't always screen smokers for lung cancer An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

KEYNOTE-024, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed KEYTRUDA as monotherapy demonstrated superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with high hevels of PD-L1 expression. In KEYNOTE-024, which evaluated squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 (tumor proportion score, or TPS, of 50 percent or more), KEYTRUDA provided a 50 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death and a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared to platinum doublet, the current standard of care. KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, published in The Lancet Oncology, showed KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated superior efficacy compared to chemotherapy alone as first-Line treatment. In KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, which included patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression level, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin plus pemetrexed) achieved a 55 percent objective response rate (ORR) compared to 29 percent for chemotherapy alone, the standard of care, and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent.

Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy. – Reuters Share This article was published on 09/10/2016 Most Read The tragic consequences of intolerance Indian expats caught off guard by rupee withdrawal move Prostitutes caught President-elect in White House - A symbolic start to transition of power Men dress as women to enter wedding hall Anger as millions in India run out of cash A rainforest in Kuwait?!

X Lung cancer drug fails to show advantage in clinical trial Bristol-Myers Squibb immunotherapy drug fails to beat chemotherapy in large trial Sun, Oct 9, 2016, 19:14 Updated: Sun, Oct 9, 2016, 19:56 A new drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb that turns the body into a weapon against cancer failed to beat chemotherapy in a large head-to-head clinical trial.         A new drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb that turns the body into a weapon against cancer failed to beat chemotherapy in a large head-to-head clinical trial, marking the biggest setback for the hot new field of immunotherapy. Opdivo, a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor, had been tipped as a replacement for chemotherapy for patients suffering from advanced lung cancer, but a study published on Sunday showed the new medicine is inferior to the established treatment. Those taking Opdivo typically survived for just over four months before the disease worsened, whereas those who received chemotherapy went for six months before the cancer progressed, according to the trial of 541 patients. Opdivo is already approved for non small-cell lung cancer patients who have tried chemotherapy, but Bristol-Myers had hoped the medicine would usurp the poisonous cocktail to become the first drug of choice for oncologists treating newly-diagnosed patients. “We thought Opdivo could beat chemotherapy, and we have answered the question: for the broad population it is not enough,” said Fouad Namouni, oncology development head at Bristol-Myers. Hopeful Mr Namouni said he was hopeful that adding Opdivo to an older Bristol-Myers immunotherapy, Yervoy, would be more effective than chemotherapy, but a large study testing that combination is not expected to be completed until 2018. Lung cancer is the most common and deadliest form of the disease, with 535,000 patients diagnosed each year in Europe and the US, and roughly 85 per cent of cases involve non small-cell tumours. Perrigo to review options for multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri Northern Irish firm Almac plans €23m US facility expansion AstraZeneca predicts major US healthcare changes under Trump By the time most patients are diagnosed, they are already suffering from advanced disease, and roughly 95 per cent die within five years. Bristol-Myers first warned its drug had flunked the trial in August, prompting investors to wipe more than $23 billion off the value of the US pharmaceuticals group – but it did not reveal the full scale of the failure until Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT The company published the study at the annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology in Copenhagen, where oncologists gathered to pore over research from pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. Delegates at the meeting heard more positive news from Merck, another US drugmaker that has been engaged in a two-horse race with Bristol-Myers to develop checkpoint inhibitors, which work by removing brakes on the immune system so it can attack cancer. Merck published a large, late-stage study of its drug, Keytruda, which it tested in a group of patients who were selected for the trial because they were thought to be more likely to respond to the drug. These patients had tumours with very high levels of a substance known as PD-L1, a characteristic shared by somewhere between 25 and 30 per cent of all people suffering from non small-cell lung cancer. In Merck’s trial, patients taking Keytruda typically went for more than 10 months before their cancer worsened, compared with six months for those receiving chemotherapy. About 45 per cent of patients either saw their tumours disappear entirely or shrink substantially, compared with 28 per cent on chemotherapy. FDA approval Merck has submitted Keytruda for approval in untreated lung cancer patients, and the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to give the drug the green light at the end of December. The success of Merck’s trial is a vindication of the company’s embrace of an emerging field of science known as precision medicine, where drugs are targeted at smaller subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit. Conversely, Bristol-Myers tested Opdivo in a wider pool of patients, a strategy which would have resulted in higher prescriptions and drug sales had the trial been successful. Merck published another small trial in which patients were given Keytruda and chemotherapy simultaneously, which suggested that this combination could be more effective than either single regimen. In the study of 123 people, patients who took both drugs at the same time went for 13 months without their cancer getting worse, with 55 per cent of them experiencing a remission or substantial tumour shrinkage, compared with 29 per cent for chemotherapy alone. Dr Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s top scientist, said the findings from both studies showed that immunotherapies were “becoming foundational in the way that we treat cancer”. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Bristol-Myers Squibb Merck Read More Glaxo sues Pfizer Ireland over alleged patent infringement Sales at Endo jump 18.6% on demand for generic drugs Debt-laden Valeant Pharmaceuticals cuts full-year forecast Venn Life Sciences wins €2.5m clinical trials contract GSK takes case against Pfizer over meningococcal vaccine Kinesis Health Technologies raises €590,000 in funding Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Personal Finance Government raises health insurance stamp duty levy by 10% Retail & Services Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy Other Sports Conor McGregor makes UFC history at Madison Square Garden Health & Family Medical matters: Childhood cancer goes against a natural order Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Security camera firm eyes more success in Europe 14:03 Russia ‘raider attack’ case makes it to the High Court 11:00 Facebook bug ‘kills’ millions of users, even Mark Zuckerberg 10:52 Trump success has sparked major sell-off in bonds 08:00 World of finance awaits Trump presidency 07:30 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy 2 Ireland caught up in international bond market sell-off 3 Imagine and Motorola settle €138m lawsuit 4 Over 2,000 march in Athenry in support of Apple data centre 5 ‘Overcorrection’ in house prices since financial crash 6 US tax cut targeting Irish-based firms could emerge in first 100 days 7 Ireland makes flurry of deals with Vietnam 8 Isme chief executive Mark Fielding steps down 9 AIG urges ban on whiplash claims to cut premiums 10 China’s new hardware innovation hub – a magnet for Irish start-ups Never miss a story.

Early results evaluating five patients with metastatic melanoma for efficacy and 16 patients for safety were reported. In patients naïve to anti-PD-1 treatment objective responses were observed in three out of four (75%) including one complete response (CR) and two partial responses (PR's). One patient with progressive disease while receiving anti-PD-1 therapy was observed to have stable disease (SD). These data were presented in a poster session on Sunday at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark. SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. No immune-related adverse events were reported, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1-2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia consistent with the engagement of TLR9 and production of interferon alpha. The study also included biomarker assessments suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and pembrolizumab resulted in elevation of gene signatures consistent with an increase in immune cell types and multiple immune functions. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The ongoing dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab. In addition, the trial is evaluating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax's proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 activates multiple anti-tumor activities of innate immune cells and activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its preliminary safety and activity. For information about SD-101 trials that are currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov. About Dynavax Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers and develops novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious and inflammatory diseases and oncology. Dynavax's lead product candidates are HEPLISAV-B™, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine and SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in several Phase 1/2 studies.

REUTERS/Alex Domanski/File PhotoMore By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low.

Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.

REUTERS/Alex Domanski/File PhotoMore By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

Patients in the study -- most of whom were men, and had a history of smoking -- had already tried at least one other therapy unsuccessfully. Roche’s results come amid intense interest in medicines that harness the immune system to help fight lung cancer. Tecentriq would compete with recently-approved treatments from Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Both U.S. drugmakers just finished trials in a much bigger group of patients: those who are treated for the first time. Bristol’s drug failed and Merck’s succeeded in results presented alongside Roche’s at the conference on Sunday. Importantly, Tecentriq also helped patients whose immune systems didn’t already show a strong response before treatment, said Dan Chen, the Swiss drugmaker’s head of cancer immunotherapy development. Patients who already had a strong immunity responded even better to the drug, Chen said. They lived a median of more than 20 months, compared with a 8.9 months for those on chemotherapy, in the Roche-funded study. “The survival benefit that we’re seeing here is unprecedented,” Chen said in a telephone interview. “This forms the foundation of our cancer immunotherapy development. Tecentriq will be used as a single agent but also in combination in the future.” Tecentriq was approved in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in lung cancer by the middle of next week. The drug may have about 2.15 billion francs ($2.19 billion) in sales in 2019, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Maker wants mandatory first-dollar coverage for it MedpageToday savesaved Analyst: F. Perry Wilson, MD, MSCE by MedPage Today Staff October 10, 2016 Mylan Pharmaceuticals, which has come under fire for the high price of its EpiPen product for averting anaphylactic reactions, is pursuing a new strategy to get the medication covered by insurance, according to researchers writing in Annals of Internal Medicine. In this video commentary, MedPage Today clinical reviewer F. Perry Wilson gives his take on an unprecedented approach. A transcript of his commentary follows: In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals purchased the rights to the Epipen from Merck, and the rest, as they say, is history. With prices skyrocketing, Mylan was called to task by congress, where CEO Heather Bresch withstood 4 hours of questioning about her company's business practices. Highlights from that interview included disclosure of the fact that Bresch's $18-million compensation package made her the sixth highest paid biopharma CEO in the world and that her pay had increased 671% as the price of EpiPens rose. She also reported that Mylan makes only a $50 profit on EpiPen sales, though the number turned out to be significantly higher than that. Now it's hard to find hard numbers on how much EpiPen costs to make, but I can tell you that epinephrine was first synthesized in 1906, and I can buy a gram of it from Sigma-Aldrich for about $20 bucks, making the 0.3 milligrams in an EpiPen dose cost about six tenths of a penny. But despite the public shaming, we haven't seen an about-face on EpiPen prices from Mylan. So you're a pharmaceutical company facing considerable public outrage about your pricing of a life-saving medication. You have a couple of options. First, you could reduce the price of the drug. But that might cut into profit margins. Second, you could get someone else to pay for the drug. In the great American medical tradition of transferring costs to other people, Mylan is making a play to get insurance companies to pay for the entirety of the EpiPen. Without copays. First, I wanted to look at the out-of-pocket cost for EpiPen. As of this video, it's about $600 (with a coupon!). What about with insurance? Obviously, it will vary, but you can see from this table that most high-deductible plans, at least, classify EpiPen as tier 2 and many don't reimburse it at all. Also, remember that many plans require individuals to pay the full cost of drugs until they meet their annual deductible. But there is one way to get the insurance company to bear the full cost no matter what, a little loophole introduced in the Affordable Care Act, and Mylan is in the process of trying to squeeze through it. A well-intentioned part of the ACA was a requirement that insurance companies cover, without copay, preventive medicine services given an "A" or "B" recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. Here I give you the entirety of medications that meet this definition: You get the picture, right? There are only four, and two of them are aspirin. Does the EpiPen deserve to be elevated to these lofty preventive heights? Is the EpiPen a preventive medication? Two papers take two different sides on the issue. The first, led by Leonard Fromer but written by Mylan contractors, appears in the American Journal of Medicine. The article can be broken down into a few points. One: EpiPen saves lives. This is really undeniably true. Of course, lots of things save lives – open-heart surgery comes to mind – and we wouldn't call them preventive. Two: EpiPen is too expensive for many people to pay for. This is also undeniably true. Here are the abandonment rates, provided kindly by Mylan. Three: If the USPSTF classified EpiPen as preventive, insurance companies would be forced to pay for it, and more people would get it. Again, I agree. Four: EpiPen is preventive. It prevents anaphylaxis. And here's the rub. This all rests on the USPSTF stating that EpiPen is as much a preventive medication as aspirin is. On the other side of the rink is this paper, appearing in Annals of Internal Medicine: The basic point made here is simple: EpiPen is no more a preventive medicine than appendectomy. The larger point is this: Let's not let pharmaceutical companies get away with predatory pricing by transferring that cost to insurance companies – as in the end, that raises premiums for all of us. Look – by some definitions, all medications are preventive. We give penicillin for Strep throat to prevent rheumatic fever. We give omeprazole to prevent gastric reflux. These things work, and hey – maybe they should be free to everyone. But transferring costs to insurance doesn't actually make anything free. This is my sister (on the right). She needs an EpiPen due to a history of anaphylaxis. She currently pays $600 every 12 months for this since they expire every year. For her sake, I'd love her insurance company to cover this cost entirely. But by proxy, I'm asking all of you to pay more. What we are seeing here is a new business strategy – one in which drug costs reflect not the research and development or even marketing dollars that go into them, but simply what the market will bear. Life-threatening situations are not where we want to test how well the invisible hand functions. For now, if this new strategy upsets you, you should talk to the Federal Trade Commission, as the FDA has no authority to regulate drug prices. Neither does the FTC actually, but at least they can call out anticompetitive practices. It may be time for physicians to inject some adrenaline into this debate. 2016-10-10T17:52:32-0400 3 comments Next More in Primary Care Wind Turbines Versus Bats: That's Improbable!

Oil rose after Russia's government said it supports efforts by Opec to cut oil production, while investors also reacted to the latest twists in the US presidential race. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Apple reached its highest price of the year and led tech stocks higher after new reports of fires affecting Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone, which competes with Apple's iPhone. Early in the day stocks were on track for far larger gains. Steve Chiavarone, an associated portfolio manager for Federated Investors, said a tumultuous weekend for Republican candidate Donald Trump contributed to the market's gains. He said investors mostly expect Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win, and they are concerned about the effect Mr Trump's trade proposals would have on the market and the economy. "What you're seeing in the market is a cheering of the status quo," he said. In his view, that is because investors understand Mrs Clinton's views and what her administration might look like even though they may disagree with her on issues such as tax policy. The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 88.55 points, or 0.4%, to 18,329.04. The index rose as much as 159 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 9.92 points, or 0.5%, to 2,163.66. The Nasdaq composite added 36.27 points, or 0.7%, to 5,328.67. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia supports Opec's efforts to cut oil production. In late September the nations of Opec announced a preliminary agreement to trim oil production, but Russia, a major energy producer, is not a member of Opec. Benchmark US crude rose 1.54 dollars, or 3.1%, to 51.35 dollars a barrel in New York. That was its highest closing price since July 2015. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 1.21 dollars, or 2.3%, to 53.14 dollars a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil climbed 1.70 dollars, or 2%, to 88.44 dollars and Devon Energy added 1.58 dollars, or 33.7%, to 44.39 dollars. Apple climbed 1.99 dollars, or 1.7%, to 116.05 dollars as investors hope it will be able to sell more iPhones as competitor Samsung faced new problems with its Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said it has changed its production of the phones following reports that some of its replacement phones are overheating and catching fire, just as the original version of the phone did before Samsung recalled it last month. Samsung did not confirm or deny a report from a Korean news agency that it suspended production of the Note 7 phone. Drugmaker Mylan gained 2.93 dollars, or 8.2%, to 38.87 dollars. On Friday the company agreed to pay 465 million dollars to settle allegations it overcharged the Medicaid programme for its EpiPen allergy shot. Legislators and federal health authorities had said Mylan wrongly classified EpiPen as a generic drug instead of a brand-name one, which meant Mylan paid lower rebates to federal and state Medicaid programmes. The stock is down 20% since late August. Bristol-Myers Squibb plunged again after the company reported more data from a study of its drug Opdivo in lung cancer patients. It fell 5.62 dollars, or 10.1%, to 49.81 dollars. Rival Merck rose 1.13 dollars, or 1.8%, to 63.90 dollars as investors were pleased with results from a study of its cancer treatment Keytruda. Bristol-Myers stock has dropped 34% since the company announced initial results from that trial in early August, which has sent it to almost two-year lows. Merck is up 10% over the same time. The Mexican peso grew stronger following Mr Trump's calamitous weekend. Mr Trump has criticised Mexico and its trade agreements with the US, so the peso has become something of an indicator of how investors feel about the election. The currency has tended to weaken when investors feel Mr Trump is doing better and gets stronger when investors feel more confident in Mrs Clinton's chances. The US buys about 80% of Mexico's exports, which gives it a big influence on the Mexican economy. Following the peso's surge on Monday, one US dollar bought just 18.92 pesos, versus the 19.26 pesos it bought on Friday. The peso has weakened sharply this year but is currently the strongest it has been in about a month. Twitter continued to fall as investors grew less optimistic that the company will be sold. Twitter sank 2.29 dollars, or 11.5%, to 17.56 dollars. It fell 20% on Thursday on reports that possible buyers including Apple and Alphabet had decided not to make offers. Twitter has been on a big run since late July on rumours the company might be sold. The stock is now the lowest it has been since early August. Salesforce.com, which investors believe is a possible buyer, rose 4.19 dollars, or 5.9%, to 75.10 dollars. Manufacturer Dover forecast a smaller profit and a bigger decline in revenue because of weaker spending in several industries and production problems in its retail refrigeration unit. The company also said its purchase of British company Wayne Fueling Systems will not close until early next year because regulators in the United Kingdom are still reviewing the deal. The stock gave up 5.55 dollars , or 7.7%, to 66.69 dollars . Gold rose 8.50 dollars to 1,260.40 dollars an ounce. Silver added 28 cents to 17.66 dollars an ounce. Copper picked up three cents to 2.20 dollars a pound. Germany's DAX rose 1.3% and the CAC-40 in France was 1.1% higher. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.1%. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday. The dollar rose to 103.68 yen from 103.06 yen on Friday. The euro fell to 1.1139 dollars from 1.1182 dollars, and the British pound fell to 1.2351 dollars from 1.2435 dollars. Bond trading was closed for the Columbus Day holiday.

The S&P 500‘s close of 2163.66 was 0.46% better than Friday’s closing level. It wasn’t a winner for every stock, though. Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) couldn’t do anything to fend off the sellers on Monday. Here’s a closer look at what went wrong for each. Twitter Inc (TWTR) Last Thursday, when Twitter lost 20% of its value on the heels of news that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) weren’t interested in acquiring the company, most TWTR owners figured the worst was over. They were wrong. TWTR shares fell another 11.5% today — reaching a new multi-week low in the process — following another round of reports saying the same thing, perhaps underscoring the notion even if it wasn’t breaking news. 5 Stocks to Sell Now or Short Into the Ground Bloomberg gets the blame/credit. It reported this weekend that a meeting to discuss a sale planned for Friday had been cancelled, deflating any lingering hopes that a bidder was waiting in the wings. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) What was good news for Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) on Monday ended up being bad news for rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb, sending BMY 10% lower as a result. The battleground was non-small cell lung cancer. Bristol-Myers Squibb was taking aim at that ailment, but announced in August that its Opdivo failed to achieve adequate efficacy. An update on that trial released today didn’t make Opdivo look any better. Merck poured salt in the wound dished out to BMY shareholders when it announced today that its Keytruda did manage to create positive results as a therapy for lung cancer in its late-stage trial. While Keytruda still may not inherently become the “go-to” drug for all cases of NSCLC, the fact that it even performs better than chemo in some cases bodes well for MRK, and puts Bristol-Myers Squibb even further behind the eight ball. Twilio Inc (TWLO) Finally, cloud computing name Twilio saw its shares plunge 14% on Monday following reports that a handful major shareholders are planning to sell some of their TWLO stakes, locking in gains on the stock following its rally since the June 23rd IPO. The company also intends to sell shares. All told, $400 million worth of Twilio stock is going to be included in the secondary offering. The company’s portion of that total is $50 million, with the rest consisting of individual shareholders and institutions. That’s a huge chunk of the company’s $4.6 billion market cap, though, and investors are fearful that injection of supply could work against the value of TWLO. Indeed, it already has. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

As Shares Dip 10% A surprising failure for Opdivo opens the door for a competitor to grab significant market share. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 10, 2016 at 4:06PM Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. What happened Shares of global drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) tumbled as much as 10% during Monday's trading session following the release of its primary data from the CheckMate-026 study involving its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy drug, Opdivo. So what In August, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that its phase 3 CheckMate-026 study involving Opdivo as a monotherapy treatment for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 5%. What we didn't know at the time was how close or far away from its goals Opdivo was. We now have that answer. Based on a press release over the weekend, Opdivo's median PFS in patients with PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to 5% was 4.2 months, compared to 5.9 months in patients with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The hazard ratio of 1.15 implies slight favorability toward chemotherapy as opposed to Opdivo as a monotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC. In terms of survival, patients taking Opdivo demonstrated a very modest edge of 14.4 months versus 13.2 months for chemotherapy. In sum, Opdivo failed miserably to get anywhere close to reaching its primary endpoint. Making matters worse, over the weekend, Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced that its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda hit its mark in a first-line advanced NSCLC study in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. According to the phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 trial, Keytruda cut the risk of disease progression or death by 50%, with progression-free survival in the Keytruda arm of 10.3 months compared to just 6 months for the chemotherapy arm. Furthermore, 80.2% of Keytruda patients were alive at the 6-month mark compared to 72.4% of the chemotherapy arm, and there was a clear confirmed response rate improvement for Keytruda (45% vs. 28%) compared to the chemotherapy arm. In other words, Keytruda is lined up for a first-line advanced NSCLC approval, and Opdivo is not. Image source: Merck. Now what Though this news is nothing short of shocking, and it's shaken Bristol-Myers Squibb's investors to the core, I would strongly suggest against giving up on Opdivo just yet. Investors should keep in mind that that the CheckMate-026 trial was designed as a monotherapy, and historically, cancer immunotherapies work better when used in combination with existing oncology drugs. Also note that Opdivo remains a foundation therapy for a number of cancer treatments, including second-line NSCLC and renal cell carcinoma. It's not uncommon for different cancers, and cancer stages, to respond differently to a medication, so it would be unwise to overreact to today's news. Bristol-Myers Squibb still offers dozens of ongoing clinical and planned combination and monotherapy opportunities with Opdivo, and based on its track record, at least some of them are likely to succeed. While peak annual sales estimates of Opdivo can rightly come down a bit after its decisive first-line NSCLC failure, and peak sales estimates for Merck's Keytruda can rightly be increased, Opdivo still has the potential to provide significant top- and bottom-line growth for Bristol-Myers going forward. With its PEG nearing one, I believe value and growth investors may want to give Bristol-Myers Squibb a closer look. Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

As Shares Dip 10% A surprising failure for Opdivo opens the door for a competitor to grab significant market share. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 10, 2016 at 4:06PM Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. What happened Shares of global drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) tumbled as much as 10% during Monday's trading session following the release of its primary data from the CheckMate-026 study involving its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy drug, Opdivo. So what In August, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that its phase 3 CheckMate-026 study involving Opdivo as a monotherapy treatment for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 5%. What we didn't know at the time was how close or far away from its goals Opdivo was. We now have that answer. Based on a press release over the weekend, Opdivo's median PFS in patients with PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to 5% was 4.2 months, compared to 5.9 months in patients with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The hazard ratio of 1.15 implies slight favorability toward chemotherapy as opposed to Opdivo as a monotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC. In terms of survival, patients taking Opdivo demonstrated a very modest edge of 14.4 months versus 13.2 months for chemotherapy. In sum, Opdivo failed miserably to get anywhere close to reaching its primary endpoint. Making matters worse, over the weekend, Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced that its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda hit its mark in a first-line advanced NSCLC study in patients whose tumors had PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. According to the phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 trial, Keytruda cut the risk of disease progression or death by 50%, with progression-free survival in the Keytruda arm of 10.3 months compared to just 6 months for the chemotherapy arm. Furthermore, 80.2% of Keytruda patients were alive at the 6-month mark compared to 72.4% of the chemotherapy arm, and there was a clear confirmed response rate improvement for Keytruda (45% vs. 28%) compared to the chemotherapy arm. In other words, Keytruda is lined up for a first-line advanced NSCLC approval, and Opdivo is not. Image source: Merck. Now what Though this news is nothing short of shocking, and it's shaken Bristol-Myers Squibb's investors to the core, I would strongly suggest against giving up on Opdivo just yet. Investors should keep in mind that that the CheckMate-026 trial was designed as a monotherapy, and historically, cancer immunotherapies work better when used in combination with existing oncology drugs. Also note that Opdivo remains a foundation therapy for a number of cancer treatments, including second-line NSCLC and renal cell carcinoma. It's not uncommon for different cancers, and cancer stages, to respond differently to a medication, so it would be unwise to overreact to today's news. Bristol-Myers Squibb still offers dozens of ongoing clinical and planned combination and monotherapy opportunities with Opdivo, and based on its track record, at least some of them are likely to succeed. While peak annual sales estimates of Opdivo can rightly come down a bit after its decisive first-line NSCLC failure, and peak sales estimates for Merck's Keytruda can rightly be increased, Opdivo still has the potential to provide significant top- and bottom-line growth for Bristol-Myers going forward. With its PEG nearing one, I believe value and growth investors may want to give Bristol-Myers Squibb a closer look. Sean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.
