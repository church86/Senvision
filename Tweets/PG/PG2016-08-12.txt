Kyrie playing hero ball. Crazy they didn't add a pass first PG on this team. Team USA always at its best with guys like Kidd & CP3
The Serbian PG just threw one of the best passes I've ever seen...dude's gotta hit the shot off it though
Irving passes the ball to PG.
Stands.
Holds up hand for return pass.

At least one of my followers knows how much I *love* that.  :-) #dr

@MarkHarrisNYC Saw it in '86 as a teenager w/a bunch of kids. Was funny & scary & felt like a PG-13 movie instead of an R rated movie.
All kyrie can do is iso, he can't run a team how a real pg suppose to
That Siberia PG is dirty lol that dish was good
@AMAobamacare Eh, not sure. They're struggling to initiate offense. Not confident in PG or Jimmy running the point.

@samaranthu2 ,met pg
They really need a PG. This why the warriors lost the championship. Weak ass iso ball
Man, those Serbians can ball. PG Number 4, Teodosic is ridiculous! #TeamUSA #Rio2016
@DiMurphyMN Will the language stay PG for game one?  If not I can't promise there won't be an intervention.
Did anyone else just see the Serbian PG throw a no look to the three point line from under the basket!? Did I imagine that?
How can you not love Teodosic? Best PG NOT in NBA.  Too bad his buyout is ridiculous.
Serbia PG making some fun passes.
Yo this PG from Serbia is a problem. Dude has dimes
@MoneyBall_AP @Coach_CourtneyB @CoachBuff5 he's def a guard who can make plays, not a PG though

@kuya_karl this Serbian PG, TEODOSIC, needs an NBA contract
PG does a blow by on the close out, and the long rebound goes in his area.

I hate blow by close outs, and I know good coaches who teach it.
Team USA needs to give PG the ball. The Serbs ain't playin
Get PG the rock!!!

@PG_kamiya I agree
Imo, the usa mens bb team looks like they are halfassing it out there..no one but pg playing defense...smh
It's not tragic I have a small circle that's a blessing
@VelVelHoller they're slowly leaving that PG era tho haha
@C2_Cooper need to run Draymond, Melo, Durant, PG and Butler more.
@PaulSturtz @knicksdude @stephenasmith yeah melo's scoring is better, PG's 2 way play makes him better imo
@blackdogpat Also, the US lost
@TorontoPacer if we being honest the only reason we still got the lead is because of pg

Kyrie has the potential to be the best PG in the league! He's only 24

@HellooAle we gotta keep it on the down low tho
@Kareem_shabazz @knicksdude @stephenasmith would rather have him on my team than PG imo. More of a go to scorer

Talk about PG and Klay struggling w/ Irving, Durant and Anthony.  How about starting a slasher like Butler with those three? #mix&match
This is where they miss Lebron, because as good as KD, Melo, and PG are, they can be ball stops, and the offense doesn't flow.
@PG_suar as someone that is getting into stream overlays this is a good bit of info to be mindful of when making them.
