Going Demar over Conley would have been a bad move in the NBA but it's an atrocious one in FIBA. Team US only has one true FIBA pg (lowry).
@ArturoGalletti @samesfandiari you know, it was a great idea to have Barnes as a pro bench jockey instead of having a single PG on the team.
@Simone_Biles Read your mom' family is from Punta Gorda... I am a chef in PG @BelcampoBelize. Come visit us! We'd ‚ù§Ô∏è to have you!
